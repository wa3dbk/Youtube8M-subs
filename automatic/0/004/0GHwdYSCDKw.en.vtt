00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.420 
through both of these stitches this way
and<00:03:11.490> then<00:03:12.490> we<00:03:12.610> turn<00:03:12.970> our<00:03:13.510> stitches<00:03:14.140> around

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and then we turn our stitches around

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.500 
and then we turn our stitches around
like<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:17.730> okay<00:03:18.730> hopefully<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.330> made<00:03:19.480> sense

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
like this okay hopefully that made sense

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.130 
like this okay hopefully that made sense
then<00:03:20.140> we'll<00:03:20.320> purl<00:03:20.740> those<00:03:21.100> two<00:03:21.160> stitches

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
then we'll purl those two stitches

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:34.500 
then we'll purl those two stitches
together<00:03:28.740> like<00:03:29.740> so<00:03:32.310> now<00:03:33.310> we're<00:03:33.640> going<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.060> yarn

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
together like so now we're going to yarn

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.730 
together like so now we're going to yarn
round<00:03:35.320> needles<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.340> want<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.820> yarn<00:03:37.740> to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
round needles so we want the yarn to

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.640 
round needles so we want the yarn to
come<00:03:39.010> over<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.970> top<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:40.510> back<00:03:40.870> around<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
come over the top and back around to the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
come over the top and back around to the
front<00:03:43.020> so<00:03:44.020> that's<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.470> yarn<00:03:44.740> round<00:03:45.040> needle<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
front so that's a yarn round needle and

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.260 
front so that's a yarn round needle and
then<00:03:46.240> we<00:03:46.420> will<00:03:46.600> purl<00:03:46.990> three<00:03:48.240> we've<00:03:49.240> got<00:03:49.300> one

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
then we will purl three we've got one

00:03:51.270 --> 00:04:00.600 
then we will purl three we've got one
two<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:54.000> three<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.680> we<00:03:59.860> are<00:03:59.980> going<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.310> yarn

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
two and three then we are going to yarn

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.320 
two and three then we are going to yarn
round<00:04:00.970> needle<00:04:01.330> again<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:01.870> yarn<00:04:02.200> over<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:03.330> back

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
round needle again so yarn over and back

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.720 
round needle again so yarn over and back
around<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.930> front<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.500> then<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:06.550> will

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
around to the front and then we will

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.479 
around to the front and then we will
purl<00:04:07.120> two<00:04:07.720> together<00:04:08.020> so<00:04:11.310> we're<00:04:12.310> going<00:04:12.430> to

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
purl two together so we're going to

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.080 
purl two together so we're going to
repeat<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.239> sequence<00:04:13.630> all<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.739> way<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.790> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
repeat this sequence all the way to the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.410 
repeat this sequence all the way to the
end<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:17.290> row

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.550 

row-three<00:04:23.420> we're<00:04:23.750> going<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.990> begin<00:04:24.260> by

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
row-three we're going to begin by

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.230 
row-three we're going to begin by
knitting<00:04:24.890> one<00:04:27.520> then<00:04:28.520> we're<00:04:28.670> going<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.970> yarn

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
knitting one then we're going to yarn

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.610 
knitting one then we're going to yarn
over<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.040> slip<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.220> next<00:04:31.370> stitch<00:04:31.520> purlwise

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
over and slip the next stitch purlwise

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.580 
over and slip the next stitch purlwise
then<00:04:33.620> we'll<00:04:33.830> knit<00:04:34.100> one<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.050> pass<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.350> slip

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.740 
together and then yarn over and that
will<00:05:26.840> finish<00:05:27.080> our<00:05:27.760> repeat<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:29.060> we'll<00:05:29.270> repeat

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
will finish our repeat so we'll repeat

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.620 
will finish our repeat so we'll repeat
this<00:05:29.960> sequence<00:05:30.230> all<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:31.040> way<00:05:31.190> until<00:05:31.580> we<00:05:32.390> reach

stitch in our row we'll have done our
yarn<00:05:44.479> over<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:44.840> then<00:05:45.080> we<00:05:45.410> will<00:05:45.680> knit<00:05:45.949> one

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:57.350 

ro4<00:05:49.630> we're<00:05:49.900> going<00:05:50.080> to<00:05:50.169> begin<00:05:50.320> by<00:05:50.889> purling<00:05:51.699> two

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.270 

then<00:05:58.360> we're<00:05:58.479> going<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.720> yarn<00:05:59.080> round<00:05:59.680> needle<00:06:00.130> so

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
then we're going to yarn round needle so

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.950 
then we're going to yarn round needle so
go<00:06:00.400> over<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.820> top<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.240> back<00:06:01.300> around<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.840> the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
go over the top and back around to the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.670 
go over the top and back around to the
front<00:06:03.389> then<00:06:04.389> we're<00:06:04.510> going<00:06:04.690> to<00:06:04.750> purl<00:06:05.169> three

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
front then we're going to purl three

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.950 
front then we're going to purl three
together<00:06:05.949> so<00:06:06.550> go<00:06:06.699> right<00:06:06.970> through<00:06:07.300> these<00:06:07.479> three

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.159 
together so go right through these three
stitches<00:06:08.260> purl<00:06:08.770> wise<00:06:09.540> purl<00:06:10.540> those<00:06:10.870> all

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
stitches purl wise purl those all

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.230 
stitches purl wise purl those all
together<00:06:11.590> and<00:06:12.040> drop<00:06:12.580> them<00:06:12.790> all<00:06:12.910> off<00:06:13.090> the

going<00:06:38.080> to<00:06:38.139> yarn<00:06:38.380> round<00:06:38.800> needle<00:06:39.280> again<00:06:39.460> and<00:06:39.970> we

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
going to yarn round needle again and we

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.730 
going to yarn round needle again and we
will<00:06:40.930> purl<00:06:41.380> three<00:06:41.830> together<00:06:46.560> then<00:06:47.560> we<00:06:47.710> will

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
will purl three together then we will
