00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
killing these guys it's fairly simple I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.830 
killing these guys it's fairly simple I
mean<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.220> mean<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> most<00:01:29.820> honest<00:01:30.750> way

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
mean I mean that in the most honest way

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350 
mean I mean that in the most honest way
these<00:01:31.229> guys<00:01:31.560> aren't<00:01:31.890> too<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.970> only

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
these guys aren't too good the only

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
these guys aren't too good the only
problem<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.409> aggressive

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
problem is that they're not aggressive

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.910 
problem is that they're not aggressive
and<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.909> makes<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.630> pain<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.680> kill

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and it kind of makes it a pain to kill

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
and it kind of makes it a pain to kill
them<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> click<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.570> every

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
them because you have to click on every

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.859 
them because you have to click on every
single<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> sometimes<00:01:42.659> on

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
single one and you know I sometimes on

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.600 
single one and you know I sometimes on

bad<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.270> task<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.290> only<00:01:52.530> problem<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> while

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
bad of a task the only problem is while

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
bad of a task the only problem is while
you're<00:01:53.640> attacking<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:54.780> spawn

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you're attacking them they will spawn

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
you're attacking them they will spawn
these<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.799> things<00:01:55.829> called<00:01:56.219> death<00:01:56.520> spawns

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
these little things called death spawns

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
these little things called death spawns
there's<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.270> flying<00:01:57.750> bird<00:01:58.110> bat

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350

things<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.909> they're<00:02:00.119> level

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
things and there I think they're level

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.620 
things and there I think they're level
46<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:03.000> pose<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> threat

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
46 and they don't really pose a threat

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.749 
46 and they don't really pose a threat
but<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.530> annoying<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.579> can

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
but they can be annoying and they can

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
but they can be annoying and they can
attack<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.180> while<00:02:06.360> you're<00:02:06.600> attacking<00:02:07.049> the

real<00:03:21.239> guide<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.720> had<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.049> good<00:03:22.319> i<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.040> was

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
real guide I had a good i think it was

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.370 
real guide I had a good i think it was
400<00:03:23.700> 500<00:03:23.910> k<00:03:24.269> task<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.870> was<00:03:25.109> just<00:03:25.230> because

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
400 500 k task and that was just because

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.870 
400 500 k task and that was just because
of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.650> room<00:03:25.889> boots<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.430> now<00:03:26.519> they're<00:03:26.730> worse

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
of the room boots and now they're worse

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.129

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
like 800 g or 8000 GP so they're really

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.920 
like 800 g or 8000 GP so they're really
