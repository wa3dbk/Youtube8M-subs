always been a bit tricky to get the hang
of<00:04:08.690> even<00:04:09.230> on<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.470> big<00:04:09.709> screen<00:04:10.100> but<00:04:10.579> here<00:04:10.880> on

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
of even on the big screen but here on

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.690 
of even on the big screen but here on
the<00:04:11.120> 3ds<00:04:11.750> instead<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.620> simplifying<00:04:13.160> things

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
the 3ds instead of simplifying things

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.029 
the 3ds instead of simplifying things
Ubisoft<00:04:14.660> have<00:04:14.810> just<00:04:14.989> crammed<00:04:15.350> all<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.859> your

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
Ubisoft have just crammed all of your

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.370 
Ubisoft have just crammed all of your
weapons<00:04:16.489> gadgetry<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.380> interaction

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
weapons gadgetry and interaction

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.080 
weapons gadgetry and interaction
commands<00:04:18.859> onto<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.400> touchscreen<00:04:19.820> and

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
commands onto the touchscreen and

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.110 
commands onto the touchscreen and
created<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.019> confusing<00:04:21.590> cluttered<00:04:22.460> nightmare

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
created a confusing cluttered nightmare

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.270 
created a confusing cluttered nightmare
of<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.360> menu<00:04:23.630> when<00:04:24.200> everything<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:24.979> close

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
of a menu when everything is so close

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.730 
of a menu when everything is so close
together<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.360> tiny<00:04:26.720> it's<00:04:27.020> incredibly

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
together and so tiny it's incredibly

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.410 
together and so tiny it's incredibly
easy<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:28.310> equip<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:29.000> wrong

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
easy to equip the wrong

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.660 
easy to equip the wrong
item<00:04:29.720> when<00:04:29.870> you're<00:04:30.080> in<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.320> rush<00:04:30.560> but<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.430> worst

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
item when you're in a rush but the worst

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.250 
item when you're in a rush but the worst
thing<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.420> will<00:04:32.510> have<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.840> take<00:04:33.020> your

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
thing is that you will have to take your

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.860 
thing is that you will have to take your
eyes<00:04:33.440> off<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.740> main<00:04:34.130> screen<00:04:34.490> every<00:04:35.360> time<00:04:35.390> you

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
eyes off the main screen every time you

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.960 
eyes off the main screen every time you
have<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> fiddle<00:04:36.620> down<00:04:36.860> below<00:04:37.370> hoo-uh

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
have a fiddle down below hoo-uh

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.780 
have a fiddle down below hoo-uh
so<00:04:38.570> again<00:04:38.960> it's<00:04:39.170> easy<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.890> be<00:04:40.010> caught<00:04:40.220> unaware

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
so again it's easy to be caught unaware

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.450 
so again it's easy to be caught unaware
and<00:04:41.030> unprepared<00:04:41.690> by<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.320> wandering<00:04:42.680> bad<00:04:43.220> guy

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
and unprepared by a wandering bad guy

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.760 
and unprepared by a wandering bad guy
who<00:04:43.910> will<00:04:44.060> take<00:04:44.300> great<00:04:44.690> pleasure<00:04:44.960> in<00:04:45.260> gunning

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
who will take great pleasure in gunning

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.710 
who will take great pleasure in gunning
you<00:04:45.890> down<00:04:46.160> causing<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.150> have<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.330> sit

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
you down causing you to have to sit

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.750 
you down causing you to have to sit
through<00:04:47.750> an<00:04:48.140> incredibly<00:04:48.950> long<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.550> boring

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.880 
through an incredibly long and boring
load<00:04:50.270> time<00:04:50.540> before<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.170> jump<00:04:51.500> into<00:04:51.770> the

the truth is the game borders on

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.050 
the truth is the game borders on
unplayable<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:27.050> that<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.800> gutting<00:05:28.580> because
