00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.089
 Well now I have to introduce the 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.160
 two members or family members 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.390
 Lumia we are very happy because 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.230
 mexico we already have the four 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.440
 members 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.740
 We accepted a couple of months ago the 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.940
 800 and 710 were the first members 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.690
 of the rain family that is this 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.610
 association between nokia and windows and the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.990
 7.5 operating system version of 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.200
 windows 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.910
 I do not tell them we present in 800 710 and today 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 On a good day I have the pleasure of 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.870
 present the 610 that I have in my hand 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.370
 1970 and famous and these two members 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.870
 come to be part of these four 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.280
 family members I do not lie in the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.080
 mentioned and features 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.970
 main for example the phone 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.360
 number 900 is that it has one more screen 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.430
 big 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.739
 unlike the 800 that has a lack 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.510
 of 3.7 this has a plant of age of 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.940
 44 inches 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.820
 which makes it good in some way 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.530
 they are lovers of games or really to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.000
 the people who like all the means 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.680
 multimedia from youtube etc. and so on 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.240
 they experience extremely 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.150
 gratifying that one more screen 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.369
 front and same comes with a gap of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.900
 polycarbonate that do it extremely 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.790
 resistant but also in terms of 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.950
 One- piece design Albacete very 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.750
 aesthetic and very elegant at hand in the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.659
 case of the 610 is the same system 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.070
 operative that almost 900 and what we want 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.140
 with our proposal is that more in the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.950
 hands and more more Mexicans premium the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.659
 windows experience 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.329
 that it does not matter the price but that 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.710
 really have all the part part 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.280
 of experience in what it is that we 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.990
 what we look for in 610 and 900 already 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.000
 find as I mentioned them in Mexico 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.130
 in the Mexican market right now that in its 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.189
 in its initial production both phones 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.710
 nothing else is operator of the cel 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.030
 900 phone this exclusive from the 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 sine will not have any other operator 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.500
 and in the case of 610 you have a moment of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.450
 2 months of fats from heaven so that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.579
 after this device is incorporated with 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.579
 other market operators 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.340
 then it really is a proposal 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.770
 integral we have worked during 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 very many hours and a lot 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.100
 time to have in each of the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.410
 four members that finally already 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.670
 are and will continue adding others 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.950
 members of the bride's family 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.190
 with new evidence of advantages and new 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.390
 benefits but nowadays 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.220
 Fortunately, the Mexican market 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.470
 Well, you can have these four phones 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.570
 containers in your pocket based on your 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.220
 telecommunications needs and 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.550
 we want that good you were in a very 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.740
 good lack for the market enamels 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.390
 On the other hand we are also 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.650
 introducing soon we are going to 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.710
 know the new members of the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.810
 family is already another segment is a 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.900
 segment that goes most to the party 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.850
 average low average of telephones but that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.110
 somehow every day more mind is 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.330
 putting more benefits in their 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.480
 phones that is below 200 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.670
 150 dollars 60 dollars and every day they go to 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.680
 have a little more benefits and 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.260
 that also good in the case of mexico 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.730
 there is huge market that these follow their 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.430
 frames also us 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.099
 and that's something that is not a phone that 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.629
 to each hand of each Mexican based on 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.650
 your telecommunications needs 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.190
 masses are the daily needs 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.709
 then many surprises come 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.140
 we follow for example in the part of 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 applications and integrating more and more 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.410
 applications in our various 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.290
 stores the nights story and my brother 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.940
 trace and for that part of the offer in what 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.860
 that is very attractive then I am 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 public consumer who searched for phone 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.160

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.069
 benefits in terms of applications or 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.420
