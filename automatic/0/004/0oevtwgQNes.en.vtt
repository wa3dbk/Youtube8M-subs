here's<00:01:34.880> what<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.300> standard<00:01:35.900> grip<00:01:36.110> looks<00:01:36.380> like

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
here's what the standard grip looks like

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.330 
here's what the standard grip looks like
we're<00:01:37.610> kind<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.540> oddly<00:01:38.720> it's<00:01:39.200> almost<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:40.310> a

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
we're kind of oddly it's almost like a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.760 
we're kind of oddly it's almost like a
three<00:01:40.670> finger<00:01:40.850> thing<00:01:41.259> there<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.380> something

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
three finger thing there is something

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.830 
three finger thing there is something
for<00:01:42.860> your<00:01:43.009> pinky<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.430> wrap<00:01:43.640> around<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.660> it's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
for your pinky to wrap around but it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.130 
for your pinky to wrap around but it's
not<00:01:44.990> super<00:01:45.170> secure<00:01:46.330> oddly<00:01:47.330> enough<00:01:47.420> this

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
not super secure oddly enough this

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.910 
not super secure oddly enough this
doesn't<00:01:48.500> bother<00:01:48.590> me

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
doesn't bother me

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.109 
doesn't bother me
this<00:01:49.160> actually<00:01:49.520> feels<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.910> very

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
this actually feels like a very

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.999 
this actually feels like a very
comfortable<00:01:50.810> knife<00:01:51.050> with<00:01:51.290> a<00:01:51.350> very<00:01:51.560> secure

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
comfortable knife with a very secure

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.460 
comfortable knife with a very secure
controllable<00:01:52.670> grip<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.360> if<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.229> want<00:01:54.380> to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
controllable grip and if you want to

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.390 
controllable grip and if you want to
choke<00:01:54.650> up<00:01:54.830> on<00:01:55.009> it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
choke up on it

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.880 
choke up on it
you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.240> do<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.479> like<00:01:57.170> many<00:01:57.380> cold<00:01:57.619> steel

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
you can do that like many cold steel

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.520 
you can do that like many cold steel
models<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.880> has<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.240> sort<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.570> shelf<00:01:59.930> before

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
models it has this sort of shelf before

models it has this sort of shelf before
the<00:02:00.860> blade

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.490 

and<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:11.000> can<00:02:11.150> close<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:12.650> that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and you can close it like that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.560 
and you can close it like that
very<00:02:15.500> nice<00:02:15.910> very<00:02:16.910> similar<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.420> way

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
very nice very similar to the way

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.210 
very nice very similar to the way

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
Spyderco sets up their lock backs so you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.770 
Spyderco sets up their lock backs so you
can<00:02:22.370> close<00:02:22.550> them<00:02:22.670> easily<00:02:22.880> one-handed<00:02:28.780> now

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
can close them easily one-handed now

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.340 
can close them easily one-handed now
here's<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> lawman<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.959> know<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.200> one

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
here's the lawman and you know it's one

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.559 
here's the lawman and you know it's one
side<00:02:33.590> by<00:02:33.740> side

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.080 

cutting-edge<00:02:41.349> length<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:42.519> not<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.909> much

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
cutting-edge length it's not that much

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.839 
cutting-edge length it's not that much
longer<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.750> lawman<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.459> bit<00:02:45.640> it's

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
longer on the lawman it's a bit it's

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.140 
longer on the lawman it's a bit it's
significant<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:46.599> not<00:02:46.720> huge<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:52.000> have
