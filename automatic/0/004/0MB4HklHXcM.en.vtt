00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.940
 or the androids vineyard how are we 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
 well you have asked when we have 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 been half an hour without uploading good videos 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.140
 I have personally been busy 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 Travel studying so now 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.550
 I have a little more free time to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.200
 dedicate myself to making videos and my partner 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.180
 he has also been working studying 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.040
 and we have not had the time so what 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.200
 Sorry for not uploading material 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.989
 so nothing starting today we're going to 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.090
 start uploading new videos and many 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 more things so let's watch a video 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.970
 interesting 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.970
 good androids or in the video I'm going 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.980
 to teach a small analysis of a 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.950
 rice on call made today in mode 11 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.500
 here it is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.810
 well this as you can see is a subject of 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.420
 Android l 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.390
 let's go to settings so you can see 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.659
 the version 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.270
 this version cyanogenmod 11 knightley 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.680
 this is a version updates blÃ© every 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.159
 two days or a day and version 4.4 point 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.819
 4 of the kat kit and as you can see 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.069
 in adjustments we have quite a few adjustments and 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.109
 that we can customize our mobile to 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.179
 our whim and for this I liked this 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.060
 rom because it's pretty customizable and 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.990
 stable, there is no need to install a 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.850
 program nor modules of equipment nor 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.640
 gravity box or anything like that but what 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.230
 has everything included for example to me 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.470
 like this thing 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.180
 more here you go down and lower the brightness 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.620
 or increase the brightness 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.020
 this is a function that to me 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.670
 personally, it serves me well for 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.460
 adjust the brightness pretty fast without 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.940
 that having to go to brightness adjustments I do not know 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.090
 what else when you give here to 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.700
 tasks you give up here and if you delete 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.540
 all or you can delete one by one to the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.170
 you want or this bar that here you can 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.900
 change the settings you want to put more 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.960
 things or remove more things that's also 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.980
 it's pretty good 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.280
 the lock screen as you can see 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.160
 we can customize it 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.620
 we also have state bullets that 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.610
 we can also customize it to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 holding the power off button does not 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.560
 out this turn off restart we have here 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 the profiles that we will now talk about 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.430
 it extend desktop screen 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 rather, I liked this a lot 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.939
 for example is when you're going to read or you're going to 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.069
 play on your phone that has buttons 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.010
 on the screen this also helps you 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.400
 enough to remove increase the screen and 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.310
 can enjoy your games or what 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.050
 you do your best 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.960
 let's put it back 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.650
 well he had just profiles let's see 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.220
 here in settings we have profiles 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.950
 what is this a profile 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.710
 they are predetermined settings that the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.470
 you adjust manually before for example 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.700
 when you're at home the bluetooh what 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.850
 you can deactivate or activate or we go and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.890
 here how can you see mobile data what 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.370
 you click and disable it is because 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.200
 at home 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.520
 if you have wifi for what you want 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.850
 mobile data or you can also put the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.740
 the volume of the tone alarm of a 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.160
 notification to sound loud or 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.750
 as looser and we can also put 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.390
 night so that nobody bothers us 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.040
 here we can choose several parameters and 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.900
 With only one click already have 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.230
 configured without having to touch 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.910
 many adjustments that's pretty 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.920
 interesting to my liking 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.430
 and we have many more interesting things 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.160
 this is a subject as I told you, you have to 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.870
 he was worth your pay 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.910
 if we keep pressed and we have themes 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.670
 theme packages here we have the game 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.769
 that comes by determined here we have 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.270

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.470
 free in prehistory is there the lg 3 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.290
 these topics work pretty well 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.500
 they are pretty white to me personally 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.270
 I like it 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.900
