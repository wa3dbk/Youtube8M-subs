 find us on the intersport site 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 Bourg-en-Bresse Point 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
 Oh 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.150
 yeah it's started like that in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.520
 the championship especially we had at the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.290
 last the last two months of 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 previous championship end of the season 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.040
 previous he should have finished very 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 very bad so 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.320
 it's always good to find the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.090
 smile after two wins and hear 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 she had not known in competition 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.300
 so that's great fun 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.300
 now we started like this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.860
 also last season we know what he 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.290
 became at the end of the championship 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.550
 so we hope we're not going 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.970
 finish the same way anyway 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.710
 today 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.300
 to get back to this restaurant against 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 I saw interesting things we are 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.649
 entered shyly into the match one is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.300
 mounted crescendo on or from the mark I 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.660
 think logically enough even if on a 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.660
 arrested kick 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.270
 what will the break do and whose 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
 he ensured that we know we are 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.710
 punished allowing further interruption with 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 the null score of one everywhere 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 m 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.950
 going on twice after the arm the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.460
 score so it's always more more more 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.159
 difficult obviously 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.150
 honestly I think a draw in summer and 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.820
 technology 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.770
 we tried we pushed we were here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.800
 we have unfortunately it does not happen 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.400
 enough opportunities on the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.379
 late but it was insufficient and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.379
 well here I think we gave everything 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.769
 to try to take this point which 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.769
 we would have done good 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.590
 we ran after the results so to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.230
 every time it's more complicated when 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 same second penalty hurts us 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.800
 because what we do not pass 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.190
 too much in danger 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.180
 ban 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.860
 we like to order a little the end to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.010
 a litigious situation also I 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.030
 think of having incited his closest 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.030
 and on the other side unfortunately it 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.770
 the inhabitants of the well-income in the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.500
 part a little bit which was corrected 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.670
 was not going and we made the break again 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.590
 on a stopped phase but I think 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.380
 that we were still pushing for 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 one to win we felt we 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.540
 had room to win this match on 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.720
 said it at half-time 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.730
 and here we must not leave 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.830
 the points of the first day 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.420
 in any case it was a bit of a 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.200
 discover also a whole team 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.970
 the team that did 90 minutes was 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.350
 especially a wait because we knew 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.840
 not too much in what state some players 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.310
 were going to be fine as on the on the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.170
 flaw on the preparation matches he 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.800
 had only tribes that only two mi 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.780
 time so 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.040
 so obviously people are still very dad 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.360
 in point is good it shows that already in 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.340
 the state of mind and in the will of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.980
 to do well we got hooked despite the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.500
 tired we have been to the end to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.010
 defend cease these three points and 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.010
 it's interesting 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.360
