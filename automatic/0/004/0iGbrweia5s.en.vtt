00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
er g2 and zap ro- that was a mouthful

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.049 
er g2 and zap ro- that was a mouthful
but<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.069> one<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
but this is one of the one of the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.910 
but this is one of the one of the
coolest<00:00:09.389> glove<00:00:09.599> I've<00:00:09.750> ever<00:00:09.990> used<00:00:10.170> as<00:00:10.440> well<00:00:10.769> as

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
coolest glove I've ever used as well as

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.789 
coolest glove I've ever used as well as
far<00:00:11.820> as<00:00:11.940> aesthetics<00:00:12.450> go<00:00:12.630> blue<00:00:13.469> white<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
far as aesthetics go blue white and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.510 
far as aesthetics go blue white and
black<00:00:14.179> that's<00:00:15.179> probably<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> best<00:00:15.960> colorway

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
black that's probably the best colorway

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.240 
black that's probably the best colorway
like<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.580> said<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:17.910> um<00:00:18.119> bro<00:00:18.300> video<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:19.439> this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
like I said in my um bro video but this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.420 
like I said in my um bro video but this
glove<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.000> downright<00:00:21.920> one<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> coolest

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
glove is downright one of the coolest

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.700 
glove is downright one of the coolest
clubs<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.880> are<00:00:24.029> used<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> you've<00:00:25.500> got

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
clubs that are used so you've got

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.089 
clubs that are used so you've got
neoprene<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.810> latex<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> then

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
neoprene here but latex up here and then

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
neoprene here but latex up here and then
dry<00:00:29.340> fit<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.150> pretty<00:00:30.330> weird<00:00:30.750> entry<00:00:31.349> but

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
dry fit so it's pretty weird entry but

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.670 
dry fit so it's pretty weird entry but
it<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.610> fit<00:00:33.180> ever<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.809> nice<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.469> let<00:00:34.590> me

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it does fit ever so nice so just let me

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.119 
it does fit ever so nice so just let me
get<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.239> now<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> might<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.600> that

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
get this on now you might think that

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.590 
get this on now you might think that
durability<00:00:38.129> does<00:00:38.640> not<00:00:38.850> go<00:00:39.090> very<00:00:39.300> well<00:00:39.450> with

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
durability does not go very well with

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.740 
durability does not go very well with
with<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.440> glove<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.270> much

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
with this glove but it actually is much

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.959 
with this glove but it actually is much
much<00:00:43.620> better<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.160> looks<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
much better than that looks because this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
much better than that looks because this
is<00:00:45.090> black<00:00:45.420> latex<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.890> know

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
is black latex and if you don't know

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
is black latex and if you don't know
about<00:00:47.129> black<00:00:47.579> latex<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.420> much<00:00:48.750> tougher<00:00:49.140> in

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
about black latex it's much tougher in

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610 
about black latex it's much tougher in
white<00:00:50.309> latex<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.329> white<00:00:51.989> latex<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
white latex because white latex is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
white latex because white latex is
softer<00:00:53.180> but<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.510> fooled<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.989> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
softer but don't be fooled because this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
softer but don't be fooled because this
is<00:00:55.770> actually<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> best<00:00:56.640> latex<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
is actually one of the best latex is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.799 
is actually one of the best latex is
have<00:00:57.360> ever<00:00:57.510> used<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.710> far<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.489> these

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
naturally moves back because this is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.060

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
material part is not actually good so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
material part is not actually good so
you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.149> they're<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.479> cuts<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you can see they're like cuts here and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.160 
you can see they're like cuts here and
it<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.649> doesn't<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.250> doesn't<00:01:59.399> look<00:01:59.759> right

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
it just doesn't it doesn't look right

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
it just doesn't it doesn't look right
and<00:02:01.170> now<00:02:01.320> I'll<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.860> through<00:02:02.070> my<00:02:02.130> ratings

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and now I'll just go through my ratings

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.510 
and now I'll just go through my ratings
the<00:02:03.119> grip<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.200> probably<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.799> 9<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the grip on this is probably a 9 out of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.779 
the grip on this is probably a 9 out of
10<00:02:05.930> durability<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.229> probably<00:02:07.649> an<00:02:07.979> eight<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
10 durability is probably an eight to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.029 
10 durability is probably an eight to
eight<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> half<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.629> ten<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
eight and a half out of ten because it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.449 
eight and a half out of ten because it
actually<00:02:11.520> wears<00:02:11.790> out<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> lot<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.280> quicker

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
actually wears out a lot a lot quicker

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.210 
actually wears out a lot a lot quicker
than<00:02:14.790> usual<00:02:15.000> black<00:02:15.390> latex<00:02:15.930> does<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> still

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
than usual black latex does but it still

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.020 
than usual black latex does but it still
gets<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.520> job<00:02:17.550> done

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
gets the job done

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.410 
gets the job done
strap<00:02:18.660> I'd<00:02:19.050> actually<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.830> about<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.420> two

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
strap I'd actually go with about a two

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
strap I'd actually go with about a two
out<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.720> ten<00:02:22.050> probably<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:23.280> probably<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.790> of

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
out of ten probably is probably one of

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.760 
out of ten probably is probably one of
the<00:02:23.910> worst<00:02:24.239> straps<00:02:24.780> I've<00:02:25.020> ever<00:02:25.170> used<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.620> my

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the worst straps I've ever used in my

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.830 
the worst straps I've ever used in my
life<00:02:26.010> I'll<00:02:26.310> show<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.090> user<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.660> it's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
life I'll show you it's user so it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.770 
life I'll show you it's user so it's
just<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.349> really<00:02:29.280> strong<00:02:29.819> material<00:02:30.540> it's

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
just like really strong material it's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.339 
just like really strong material it's
it's<00:02:31.110> there's<00:02:31.440> no<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.900> elastic<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.230> or

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
it's there's no like elastic on it or

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.500 
it's there's no like elastic on it or
anything<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.730> only<00:02:36.000> thing<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.300> like<00:02:36.480> about

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
anything the only thing I like about

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.059 
anything the only thing I like about
this<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.940> strap<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.680> colorway

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
this this strap is that the colorway

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.800 
this this strap is that the colorway
looks<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:41.640> good<00:02:41.790> when<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.569> glove

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
looks really good when it's on the glove

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.790 
looks really good when it's on the glove
and<00:02:43.260> there's<00:02:44.160> velcro<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:45.330> over<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.500> it's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and there's velcro all over it so it's

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.520 
and there's velcro all over it so it's
not<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.099> like<00:02:47.489> three<00:02:48.000> designated<00:02:48.720> strips<00:02:49.200> of

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
not just like three designated strips of

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.040 
not just like three designated strips of
velcro<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.819> all<00:02:51.060> over<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.810> get<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
velcro it's all over so you can get the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.589 
velcro it's all over so you can get the
best<00:02:52.260> fit<00:02:52.580> another<00:02:53.580> bad<00:02:53.790> thing<00:02:54.000> about<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.330> is

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
best fit another bad thing about this is

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.110 
best fit another bad thing about this is
the<00:02:54.840> durability<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:56.040> terrible<00:02:56.760> this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the durability on this is terrible this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.990 
the durability on this is terrible this
the<00:02:57.599> stretch<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.230> strap<00:02:58.620> we're<00:02:59.459> out<00:02:59.580> way

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the stretch of this strap we're out way

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.360 
the stretch of this strap we're out way
quicker<00:03:00.330> than<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> actual<00:03:01.170> latex<00:03:01.890> fit<00:03:02.099> on<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
quicker than the actual latex fit on the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.850 
quicker than the actual latex fit on the
glove<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.659> just<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.110> terrible

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
glove so this is just like a terrible

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.100 
glove so this is just like a terrible

there<00:03:07.500> with<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.800> strap<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.940> pretty

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
there with the strap so this is pretty

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.180 
there with the strap so this is pretty
much<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.420> end<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.750> review<00:03:10.190> there's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190

much the end of the review there's
honestly<00:03:11.790> not<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.239> ton<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:12.629> can<00:03:12.870> say<00:03:13.050> about<00:03:13.140> this
