00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
designs but I just kind of looked at the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.110 
designs but I just kind of looked at the
animation<00:02:25.989> styles<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:26.860> wonder<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120

will end up you know end up translating
well<00:02:30.970> onto<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> show<00:02:31.750> on<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.530> animation<00:02:33.750> for

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
well onto the show on the animation for

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.910 
well onto the show on the animation for
this<00:02:35.079> show<00:02:35.440> looks<00:02:35.769> decent<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:37.329> sideswipe

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
this show looks decent the sideswipe

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.080 
this show looks decent the sideswipe
transformation<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.130> out<00:02:39.310> maybe<00:02:39.489> could<00:02:39.819> win<00:02:40.060> a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
transformation I'm out maybe could win a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.430 
transformation I'm out maybe could win a
little<00:02:40.420> bit<00:02:40.569> better<00:02:40.860> maybe<00:02:43.019> go<00:02:44.019> back<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.380> look

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
little bit better maybe go back and look

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.330 
little bit better maybe go back and look
at<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> couple<00:02:44.890> things<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:46.890> mean<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
at a couple things here I mean the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.819 
at a couple things here I mean the
animation<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.329> definitely<00:02:50.170> interesting

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
animation is definitely interesting

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.930 
animation is definitely interesting
because<00:02:51.430> it's<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.940> kind<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.209> 2d<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.930> 3d<00:02:52.989> mix

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.069 

you<00:02:57.940> know<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.829> it's<00:02:59.829> it's<00:03:00.519> different<00:03:01.090> um<00:03:01.389> I

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
you know it's it's it's different um I

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.940 
you know it's it's it's different um I
mean<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.430> some<00:03:03.810> little<00:03:04.810> problems<00:03:05.019> here

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
mean you see some little problems here

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.670 
mean you see some little problems here
and<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.100> with<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.430> animation<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:07.660> um<00:03:08.260> you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
and there with the animation but um you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.979 
and there with the animation but um you
know<00:03:08.799> they've<00:03:09.010> still<00:03:09.220> got<00:03:09.400> some<00:03:09.670> time<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.209> work

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
know they've still got some time to work

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.030 
know they've still got some time to work
on<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.590> stuff<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.920> thought<00:03:14.920> the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
on it and stuff but I thought the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.920 
on it and stuff but I thought the
transformation<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.910> bit<00:03:16.090> slow<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.690> weird

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
transformation was a bit slow and weird

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.539 
transformation was a bit slow and weird
I<00:03:17.139> know<00:03:17.170> they<00:03:17.410> were<00:03:17.470> kind<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.739> trying<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:18.100> show

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
I know they were kind of trying to show

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.539 
I know they were kind of trying to show
it<00:03:18.730> off<00:03:18.880> but<00:03:19.389> it<00:03:19.569> was<00:03:19.720> very<00:03:19.959> very<00:03:20.680> slow<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.190> my

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
it off but it was very very slow in my

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.800 
it off but it was very very slow in my
opinion<00:03:21.850> um<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.790> then<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.299> don't<00:03:28.480> know<00:03:28.600> who
