00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
weights and do resistance training well

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.740 
weights and do resistance training well
first<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.490> all<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.730> lot<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.120> women<00:00:09.570> actually

scared to do weight training because
they<00:00:11.820> think<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.719> work<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.200> weights

they think that I if I work with weights

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.680 
they think that I if I work with weights
if<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.799> lift<00:00:14.040> heavy<00:00:14.219> weights<00:00:14.610> I've<00:00:14.880> become

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
lot of big muscle like you know those

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.200 
lot of big muscle like you know those
women<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.859> bodybuilding

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
women that we see in bodybuilding

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.720 
women that we see in bodybuilding
competitions<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.130> gonna

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
competitions but this is not gonna

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.960 
competitions but this is not gonna

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
happen because we women we don't have

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.759 
happen because we women we don't have
enough<00:00:30.240> testosterone<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.170> build<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.500> much

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
enough testosterone to build that much

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
enough testosterone to build that much
muscle<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.430> those<00:00:32.790> women<00:00:33.059> who<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.540> into

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
muscle and those women who go into

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
muscle and those women who go into
bodybuilding<00:00:34.410> competitions<00:00:35.160> they<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
bodybuilding competitions they take a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.470 
bodybuilding competitions they take a
lot<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> supplements<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:38.000> excess<00:00:39.000> amounts

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
lot of supplements like excess amounts

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.049 
lot of supplements like excess amounts
of<00:00:39.600> protein<00:00:40.110> powders<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.879> hormones<00:00:41.879> like

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
of protein powders and hormones like

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.810 
of protein powders and hormones like
testosterone<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.079> other<00:00:43.320> nasty<00:00:43.820> chemicals

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
testosterone and other nasty chemicals

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
testosterone and other nasty chemicals
and<00:00:45.000> hormones<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.570> help<00:00:45.629> them<00:00:46.440> build<00:00:46.710> these

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and hormones that help them build these

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.760 
and hormones that help them build these
muscles<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.879> naturally<00:00:48.500> woman<00:00:49.500> would

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
muscles because naturally woman would

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.209 
muscles because naturally woman would
never<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.610> able<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.000> build<00:00:51.239> such<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> big<00:00:52.559> muscle

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
never be able to build such a big muscle

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.910 
never be able to build such a big muscle
so<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.600> nothing<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> worry<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.469> you're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so there's nothing to worry about you're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
so there's nothing to worry about you're
not<00:00:55.949> gonna<00:00:56.309> become<00:00:56.699> bulky<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> super<00:00:57.930> big<00:00:58.170> if

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
not gonna become bulky and super big if

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.540 
not gonna become bulky and super big if
you<00:00:58.710> let<00:00:59.280> lift<00:00:59.670> heavy<00:01:00.030> weights

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
you let lift heavy weights

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.660 
you let lift heavy weights
and<00:01:01.670> why<00:01:02.300> should<00:01:02.780> we<00:01:03.010> lift<00:01:04.010> heavy<00:01:04.310> weights<00:01:04.550> and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
and why should we lift heavy weights and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.300 
and why should we lift heavy weights and
why<00:01:04.850> should<00:01:05.090> we<00:01:05.240> do<00:01:05.450> resistance<00:01:06.050> training

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
why should we do resistance training

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.570 
why should we do resistance training
well<00:01:07.310> basically<00:01:08.500> we<00:01:09.500> want<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.920> have<00:01:10.190> as<00:01:10.370> much

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
well basically we want to have as much

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.450 
well basically we want to have as much
muscle<00:01:10.880> as<00:01:11.120> we<00:01:11.330> can<00:01:11.890> because<00:01:12.890> muscle<00:01:13.340> is

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
muscle as we can because muscle is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.430 
muscle as we can because muscle is
active<00:01:13.850> tissue<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.660> increases<00:01:15.170> your

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
active tissue and it increases your

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.860 
active tissue and it increases your
metabolism<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.520> even<00:01:16.970> if<00:01:17.120> you're<00:01:17.270> resting<00:01:17.690> if

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
metabolism so even if you're resting if

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.450 
metabolism so even if you're resting if
you<00:01:17.900> do<00:01:18.140> nothing<00:01:18.590> no<00:01:19.400> link<00:01:19.730> on<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.120> couch<00:01:20.420> or

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
you do nothing no link on a couch or

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.910 
you do nothing no link on a couch or
even<00:01:22.460> sleeping<00:01:23.380> you're<00:01:24.380> burning<00:01:24.770> more

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
even sleeping you're burning more

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.710 
even sleeping you're burning more
calories<00:01:25.160> if<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.670> have<00:01:25.850> muscle<00:01:26.090> because<00:01:26.570> it's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
calories if you have muscle because it's

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.650 
calories if you have muscle because it's
active<00:01:27.200> tissue<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.880> know<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.150> takes<00:01:29.420> energy

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
active tissue you know it takes energy

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.090 
active tissue you know it takes energy
to<00:01:30.050> support<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.560> tissue<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.450> if<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.100> lift

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
to support that tissue so if you lift

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.980 
to support that tissue so if you lift
heavy<00:01:34.370> weights<00:01:34.460> if<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.300> build<00:01:35.660> more<00:01:35.930> muscle

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
heavy weights if you build more muscle

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.350 
heavy weights if you build more muscle
you<00:01:36.770> will<00:01:37.040> increase<00:01:37.400> your<00:01:37.550> metabolism<00:01:37.700> which

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
you will increase your metabolism which

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.140 
you will increase your metabolism which
is<00:01:38.540> great<00:01:38.780> because<00:01:38.960> you'll<00:01:39.260> be<00:01:39.320> able<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:40.150> burn

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
is great because you'll be able to burn

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.810 
is great because you'll be able to burn
more<00:01:41.420> fat<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.920> assume<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.369> want<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> burn

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
more fat and I assume you want to burn

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.280 
more fat and I assume you want to burn
more<00:01:43.940> fat<00:01:44.150> right<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.930> another<00:01:45.470> reason<00:01:45.800> is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
more fat right so another reason is

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.020 
more fat right so another reason is
related<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.710> first<00:01:48.890> reason<00:01:49.340> actually<00:01:49.670> in

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
related to the first reason actually in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.580 
related to the first reason actually in
year<00:01:50.300> 37<00:01:50.930> late<00:01:51.260> 20s<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:51.920> start<00:01:52.190> losing<00:01:53.590> our

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
year 37 late 20s we start losing our

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.980 
year 37 late 20s we start losing our
muscle<00:01:55.100> mass<00:01:55.130> if<00:01:55.850> we're<00:01:56.119> not<00:01:56.210> working<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:56.810> it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
muscle mass if we're not working on it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
muscle mass if we're not working on it
so<00:01:57.800> basically<00:01:58.369> what<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.820> does<00:01:58.850> it<00:02:00.010> decreases

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
so basically what it does it decreases

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.620 
so basically what it does it decreases
your<00:02:01.040> metabolism<00:02:01.880> slows<00:02:02.090> down<00:02:02.240> your

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
your metabolism slows down your

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.330 
your metabolism slows down your
metabolism<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.650> that's<00:02:03.890> what<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> lot<00:02:04.310> of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
metabolism so that's what a lot of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.889 
metabolism so that's what a lot of
people<00:02:04.550> even<00:02:04.850> if<00:02:05.119> they<00:02:05.270> eating<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.690> same

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
people even if they eating the same
