it down I went online and there was like
just<00:04:29.930> enough<00:04:30.140> lag<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.620> screw<00:04:30.890> me<00:04:31.040> up<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.400> it's

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
just enough lag to screw me up so it's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.130 
just enough lag to screw me up so it's
it's<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:31.880> little<00:04:32.120> laggy<00:04:32.300> online<00:04:32.720> from<00:04:32.960> when<00:04:33.110> I

it's a little laggy online from when I

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.990 
it's a little laggy online from when I
played<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.920> can<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.430> little<00:04:34.730> bit<00:04:34.850> tough

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
played so it can be a little bit tough

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820 
played so it can be a little bit tough
on<00:04:35.150> there<00:04:35.390> but<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:36.110> terms<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.350> single<00:04:36.560> players

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
on there but in terms of single players

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.350 
on there but in terms of single players
still<00:04:37.100> say<00:04:37.250> it's<00:04:37.370> worth<00:04:37.520> picking<00:04:37.700> up<00:04:37.970> I'm

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
still say it's worth picking up I'm

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.970 
still say it's worth picking up I'm
enjoying<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.140> I'm<00:04:39.230> not<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.410> huge<00:04:39.560> fighting

fan so I think it's worth a

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.620 
fan so I think it's worth a

then<00:07:01.110> some<00:07:01.290> of<00:07:01.410> them<00:07:01.500> are<00:07:01.590> very<00:07:01.650> complicated

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
then some of them are very complicated

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.560

pretty satisfying so this one might be a

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.980 
pretty satisfying so this one might be a
little<00:07:17.250> bit<00:07:17.520> hard<00:07:17.700> to<00:07:17.820> find<00:07:18.090> and<00:07:18.390> you<00:07:18.900> know
