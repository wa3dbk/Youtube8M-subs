00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
plan is is we're going to access this

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.100 
plan is is we're going to access this
throttle<00:01:58.830> plate<00:01:59.100> right<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.310> by<00:02:00.120> running<00:02:00.900> our

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
throttle plate right here by running our

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010 
throttle plate right here by running our
little<00:02:01.409> spray<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.369> attachment<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.119> right

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
little spray can attachment and right

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.570 
little spray can attachment and right
here<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.740> we've<00:02:04.950> got<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.400> stuff

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
here because we've got so much stuff

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.710 
here because we've got so much stuff
attached<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.570> pull

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
attached here we're not going to pull

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.030 
attached here we're not going to pull
this<00:02:06.810> out<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.920> you're

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
this out of the way now if you're

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.530 
this out of the way now if you're
working<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> different<00:02:08.820> car<00:02:09.030> word<00:02:09.269> it's

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
working on a different car word it's

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.090 
working on a different car word it's
gonna<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> whole<00:02:09.959> lot<00:02:10.080> easier<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.739> pull

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
gonna be a whole lot easier to just pull

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.710 
gonna be a whole lot easier to just pull
this<00:02:11.250> off<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> throttle<00:02:12.570> plate

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this off and see the throttle plate

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.750 
this off and see the throttle plate
basically<00:02:13.320> right<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.190> we've<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.489> place

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
basically right here we've got a place

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.550 
basically right here we've got a place
that<00:02:14.970> when<00:02:15.150> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
that when you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.310 
that when you
the<00:02:16.550> accelerator<00:02:17.120> pedal<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.960> throttle

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the accelerator pedal that throttle

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.080 
the accelerator pedal that throttle
plate<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.860> going<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.100> go<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.460> do<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.940> thing

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
plate is going to go and do that thing

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.630 
plate is going to go and do that thing
right<00:02:20.270> there<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.650> little<00:02:21.770> round<00:02:22.100> plate

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
right there so it's a little round plate

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.580 
right there so it's a little round plate
so<00:02:23.120> when<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.330> pull<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.660> off<00:02:23.840> you're<00:02:24.410> going

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
so when you pull this off you're going

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.550 
so when you pull this off you're going
to<00:02:24.650> spray<00:02:24.950> directly<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.790> there<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.560> again

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
to spray directly in there and again

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.840 
to spray directly in there and again
like<00:02:27.770> I'm<00:02:27.860> saying<00:02:28.100> our<00:02:28.220> approach<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.670> going<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
like I'm saying our approach is going to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.550 
like I'm saying our approach is going to
be<00:02:29.000> we're<00:02:29.480> going<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.630> remove<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.050> hose<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
be we're going to remove this hose and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.080 
be we're going to remove this hose and
we're<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.830> enter<00:02:30.980> through<00:02:31.460> there<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:31.970> we

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
we're going to enter through there so we

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.550 
we're going to enter through there so we
don't<00:02:32.180> have<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.510> mess<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:33.080> all<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.440> other

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
don't have to mess with all this other

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.800 
don't have to mess with all this other
stuff<00:02:33.709> it'll<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.220> an<00:02:34.400> easier<00:02:34.880> access<00:02:35.300> point

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
stuff it'll be an easier access point

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.199 
stuff it'll be an easier access point
force<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.800> now<00:02:36.950> we'll<00:02:37.310> go<00:02:37.400> ahead<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.610> get<00:02:38.090> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
force so now we'll go ahead and get the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.580 
force so now we'll go ahead and get the
start<00:02:38.450> parted<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.050> we'll<00:02:39.200> start<00:02:39.530> this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
start parted and we'll start this

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.550 
start parted and we'll start this
project<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:41.000> guys<00:02:41.240> now<00:02:41.630> we're<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.020> removing

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
project and guys now we're just removing

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080 
project and guys now we're just removing
that<00:02:42.770> screw<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.370> get<00:02:43.520> our<00:02:43.610> hose<00:02:43.790> off<00:02:43.970> and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
that screw so we get our hose off and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.000 
that screw so we get our hose off and
the<00:02:44.570> other<00:02:44.630> thing<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:45.200> what<00:02:45.740> we're<00:02:45.860> going<00:02:45.980> to

we're going to want to basically spray

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.520 
we're going to want to basically spray
the<00:02:49.520> can<00:02:49.760> for<00:02:50.330> about<00:02:50.510> two<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.959> three<00:02:50.989> minutes

we're going to want to exhaust about

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.360 
we're going to want to exhaust about
half<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.020> can<00:02:54.230> we're<00:02:54.470> going<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> on<00:02:54.830> deplete

on your first go around so we're going
to<00:03:11.690> figure<00:03:11.870> out<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.080> way<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.260> get<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.590> arranged

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
to figure out a way to get this arranged

then you should be able see if there's
any<00:04:59.450> sitting<00:04:59.780> fluid<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.170> main<00:05:00.380> thing<00:05:00.620> you

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
any sitting fluid the main thing you

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.970 
any sitting fluid the main thing you
don't<00:05:00.950> want<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.340> do<00:05:01.490> is<00:05:01.990> get<00:05:02.990> fluid<00:05:03.410> into<00:05:03.830> one

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
don't want to do is get fluid into one

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.110 
don't want to do is get fluid into one
of<00:05:04.040> your<00:05:04.100> combustion<00:05:04.430> chambers<00:05:04.880> because

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
of your combustion chambers because

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.620 
of your combustion chambers because
fluid<00:05:05.360> does<00:05:05.630> not<00:05:05.810> compress<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.950> if<00:05:07.640> you<00:05:08.090> run

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
fluid does not compress and if you run

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.210 
fluid does not compress and if you run
it<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.050> get<00:05:09.200> some<00:05:09.380> fluid<00:05:09.740> in<00:05:09.830> there<00:05:10.010> and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
it and you get some fluid in there and

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.680 
it and you get some fluid in there and
the<00:05:10.610> fluid<00:05:10.820> doesn't<00:05:11.090> compress<00:05:11.330> you're<00:05:11.570> going

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
the fluid doesn't compress you're going

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.000 
the fluid doesn't compress you're going
to<00:05:11.750> bend<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:12.020> connecting<00:05:12.440> rod<00:05:12.470> or<00:05:12.770> going<00:05:12.950> to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
to bend a connecting rod or going to

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.220 
to bend a connecting rod or going to
damage<00:05:13.220> your<00:05:13.370> engine<00:05:13.730> so<00:05:13.940> just<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.930> think

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
damage your engine so just I think

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.020 
damage your engine so just I think
that's<00:05:15.530> why<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.680> same<00:05:15.920> let's<00:05:16.400> set<00:05:16.610> five<00:05:16.790> 10

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
that's why the same let's set five 10

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.880 
that's why the same let's set five 10
minutes<00:05:17.210> because<00:05:17.450> stuff<00:05:18.110> probably<00:05:18.260> VAT<00:05:18.530> Brits

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
minutes because stuff probably VAT Brits

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.490 
minutes because stuff probably VAT Brits
pretty<00:05:19.130> quickly<00:05:19.340> so<00:05:19.730> that<00:05:19.960> makes<00:05:20.960> sure<00:05:21.050> you

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
pretty quickly so that makes sure you

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.530 
pretty quickly so that makes sure you
don't<00:05:21.680> have<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.830> sitting<00:05:22.130> fluid<00:05:22.520> so<00:05:22.820> here<00:05:23.360> just

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
don't have a sitting fluid so here just

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.050 
don't have a sitting fluid so here just
sing<00:05:23.720> out<00:05:23.870> show<00:05:24.170> my<00:05:25.040> friend<00:05:25.280> here<00:05:25.460> driving<00:05:25.970> off

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
sing out show my friend here driving off

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.490 
sing out show my friend here driving off
in<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.270> car<00:05:26.480> and<00:05:26.690> he's<00:05:26.930> going<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.200> drive<00:05:27.380> it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
in the car and he's going to drive it

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.070 
in the car and he's going to drive it
pretty<00:05:27.680> hard<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.210> we'll<00:05:29.210> wash<00:05:29.660> rinse<00:05:29.870> and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
pretty hard and we'll wash rinse and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.360 
pretty hard and we'll wash rinse and
repeat<00:05:30.350> we're<00:05:30.560> going<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.740> do<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:30.950> a<00:05:31.040> second

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
repeat we're going to do it a second

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.340 
repeat we're going to do it a second
time<00:05:31.400> because<00:05:31.700> we're<00:05:32.630> going<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.930> use<00:05:33.020> half<00:05:33.230> a

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
time because we're going to use half a

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.230 
time because we're going to use half a
can<00:05:33.530> each<00:05:33.740> time<00:05:34.010> like<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.490> instruction<00:05:35.000> set

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
can each time like the instruction set

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.770 
can each time like the instruction set
so<00:05:35.870> we'll<00:05:36.350> see<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.770> here<00:05:37.040> in<00:05:37.100> just<00:05:37.220> a<00:05:37.280> moment

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
so we'll see that here in just a moment
