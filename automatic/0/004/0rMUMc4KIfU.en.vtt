00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello and welcome to the new 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
 little tutorial someone is coming 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.750
 minecraft parents now finally for 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 the 1962 and the later version if 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 The folder is not normal 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.170
 changes installed yes it has a long time 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.400
 lasted it is finally here 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 of course as always on the download 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 left to go and you have this reason 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 Minecraft or download we are with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.370
 168 mw the whole is still 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 it updates a two-month high p 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 unfortunately, it is still not there 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 the texture pack contains that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.470
 problem is the folder otherwise so big 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.600
 would have been 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.980
 that's why you have to go to the second one 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780
 Wrong in the description go there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 her on the side of montreux when where 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.160
 he must also be able to download the world 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 you scroll down and you can 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 download the 1.6 when the rider 2 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.250
 directed and this can be downloaded when 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.220
 of course you have to have the two folders 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.750
 windows key + r press there percent 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.490
 enter from tata percent so you come in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 your roaming costs though now too 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 the point minecraft folder is located like 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 you always if you now eg your world 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.320
 do not lose noiret in the clear text 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.570
 you wanted to secure yourselves I want now 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.910
 I do not need it so I can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 delete it normally and open it 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.630
 the coming minecraft whether one in here 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.520
 that has that is my installation file 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 all steps number are listed 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 if you do not understand what the video 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 or too fast went on 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.900
 we would also have for me is for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.500
 a later problem solving and yes 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 any minecraft minecraft over 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.260
 We pull this one easily 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.900
 in here 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.140
 that lasts a long time now because many at home 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.140
 are 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.820
 once we have done that go 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.960
 into the resource packs and drag 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.960
 sometimes the texture pack here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.140
 as soon as we have done that animate 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.390
 Let's say the folder and the states first 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.950
 minecraft launcher now we have to 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.599
 Log in here, of course 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.430
 I wanted the new surface now 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.660
 do not do so you have to 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.980
 of course log in again as always yes 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 it's just that you are 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.170
 third page to whole system here now 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.819
 Do not do anything here next 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.170
 you 're going underwear right now 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.299
 and first of all, that just has to suggest 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.190
 make the link do it 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 sorry that has pretty much for tomorrow 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.569
 simply the reason da de forge the whole 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.250
 this recognizes the whole mods here 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.750
 is installed and we still have it 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.700
 times reinstall must therefore have 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.950
 I just instyle an installer 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.299
 client select my green folder 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.880
 song and click ok 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.170
 then comes a message because that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.780
 It has happened again 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.239
 The thing is , we think the whole thing is closing 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.680
 and go to minecraft folder again 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.540
 it starts now and as it does 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.980
 let's go to edit profi here you can 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.970
 Now call that as you want 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.900
 I hardly mention it, for example 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.600
 then you always have to be okay that's it 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.620
 would have to see the version 1.6 here 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.019
 Here you can now the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.160
 raman suppliers to assign volt 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.160
 Now we have to choose the whole thing 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.180
 there 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.110
 and press play 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.950
 it now only takes one tap 1 5162 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720
 Do not be surprised the whole song something like 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.150
 my whole mind that it greased 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.650
 right now it's going to be 18 mods right now 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.380
 be because I have the whole later 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 I maximize the update as a whole 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.550
 First, we must, of course, can here 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.140
 all of your graphics settings are fine 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.230
 is not there now that the problem 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.700
 because it's just not it 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190
 compatible with the trader and the shader 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.430
 worth more can you target group trainer 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.230
 Select language of rom is spoken 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.110
 of course he is here again 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.970
 abandoned here 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.390
 finished and now the texture pack too 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.390
 still select 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.780
 If you want to have it all we can 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.870
 now times represent a new world 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.130
 rated mode should be short now it can be 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.990
 that it licks I do not know it me 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.060
 know it user not receptive program 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.670
 I'm guilty of that for so long 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.730
 times ahead what should happen so and 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.900
 we are here and the sun is there 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.950
 Of course, there is the problem right away 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.760
 now with the trees they are not 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.760
 so dollar 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.610
 I apologize for that here 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.230
 we have the water is clear 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.450
 the problem is of course this here 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.460
 water there is always such a small stream 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.900
 you can not fix that , too 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.980
 on the fine and that does not even work 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.510
 not compatible 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.670
 if that can change I would 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.740
 of course with rainer install me 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.940
 a property is not there that you can 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.700
 you just install yourself 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.350
 dollar or hold manually because keeps many 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.750
 No, that's what we did 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.160
 not now maybe i will be later 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.020
 then another tournament items folder 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.070
 make out of the mouth but I know 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.400
 You do not have to go down yet 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.320
 look because I think now not normal 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.910
 that as a upload or with a tour 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.669
 - I could have liked it myself here 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.860
 install devices that all goes 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.090
 most are currently missing 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.870
 locations trial pharming money again 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.040
 broken or even a fortress earlier 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.640
 you see it works so far everything 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.669
 is running sun 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.910
 You can hear such a fortress very much 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.669
 Well 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.620
 yes that was so far from me i hope 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.240
 you enjoyed it and have fun with it 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.800
 the folder page any problems 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.970
 or ask with the folder then have 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.260
 Just write me the comments 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.760
 and I will come back to it 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.010
 I hope I had the tutorial 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.400
 fallen and we do not see you on 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.400
 next again 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.009
