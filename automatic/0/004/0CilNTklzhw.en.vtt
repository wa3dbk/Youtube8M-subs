00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.710
 ladies and gentlemen we're going now 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.260
 enjoy our presence on the plagne 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.260
 to actually introduce you to a ski that has 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.730
 a little revolutionized the industry in 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.340
 terms of design and construction and 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 who won a prize at ipsos the year 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.430
 last for the ski of the year where the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.440
 years building this is the cat 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.830
 and of the work in the vocal range or 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.620
 for sale katana is a ski built of 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.890
 classic way and that is to say 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.019
 had a wood construction with all 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.219
 the artifices it takes for one 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.320
 be able to go off track 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.269
 now we have a ski with a 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.309
 absolutely modern construction a little 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.769
 like a certain era the cars of 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.769
 formula 1 at mclaren we developed a 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.870
 what's called a top that makes it there 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.030
 where the driver is that which is fiber 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.589
 carbon and eventually everybody 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.379
 can repeat the experiment and that's 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.420
 become as a measure that even the 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.059
 production cars at mclaren are 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.580
 made public with a pub in 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.200
 carbon fiber and we end up 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.100
 now with a ski that has exactly 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.810
 the same thing 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.850
 a carbon chassis that comes 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.820
 completely wrapped structure 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.980
 internal which is a wood core and 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.020
 this structure allows with its reinforcement 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.660
 for example I will show you with the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.970
 extremely powerful reinforcement to make a 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.560
 wide ski s that very large 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.490
 also at the front since we find 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.280
 the same system 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.650
 at the 20 a very wide ski but 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.650
 extremely powerful in lateral torsion 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.060
 so that when we ski on 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.610
 even on groomed tracks we have a little 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.610
 the impression that in giant slalom in the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 conditions where 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 but against go play in the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.840
 snow much crazier the french 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.150
 say snow very foolish so that's it 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 for the technological evolution of this 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.570
 chassis is what we notice is that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.400
 the construction life works is going to 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.800
 find in vocals in two others 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.240
 ranges for the 2015 season we will have the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.630
 chance to make a site is a little bit more 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.510
 late this season we will notice 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 also that we have equipped this style 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.649
 to the attachment to the external bf is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 perfect which is actually a fixation of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.620
 touring but ultra light where we can 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.770
 to pack up in running mode with deposit 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.470
 to attack the summits where we would like 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.970
 ride with a guide when you do not have 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.620
 lifts to reach the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.840
 summits that we want to achieve 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.300
 after at the top we replace the fixation in 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 alpine mode we remove the pots and we go 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.970
 to attack the mythical descents and 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.920
 ending low it must be mentioned that the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.630
 ski still has an urgent order like 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.280
 most skis of this caliber in 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
 this moment that is to say that from here 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.280
 we are in the air and we are almost 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.049
 in neutral under the shoe so we will have 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.930
 no rebound like my giant slalom ski 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.370
 but we will have an easy handling 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.310
 ski on the snow even if we are in a 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.860
 snow that hangs so if you ever 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.560
 have the chance to get or 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.330
 to try his skis whether it's the katana 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.430
 life works or the other two models that 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.530
 will go out in the future at your side 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.200
 it is an invitation that you made 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.299
 because the extremely light ski all 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.850
 by being extremely flea so has the 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.850
 katana life works 1 what tried 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420
 and
