00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.059
 Who ever needed to show a photo or a 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 video on mobile for several friends knows 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.320
 the drama that is having to see your device 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.509
 from hand to hand when this does not happen 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.880
 Everybody crowds to see what's going on. 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.369
 being displayed on your smartphone is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.789
 unfortunately not everyone has a projector 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.180
 or smart tv but this area 42 has brought a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.550
 solution for you with a shoe box 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 a magnifying glass and some other materials 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.360
 simple it is possible to create a projector 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.360
 homemade very nice 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.579
 wants to know how to take note of the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.130
 materials and tools that you will 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.239
 need a smartphone with high index 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.120
 to shine a shoe box a magnifying glass 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.400
 a cardboard box a little larger than 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:05.269
 A Styrofoam Barbecue Cell Phone 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:09.890
 insulation tape stiletto scissors and glue 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.200
 The magnifying glass that we are going to use has 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.930
 a glass lens that favors 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.890
 the final quality of the images but any 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.470
 type can be used the greater 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.660
 the larger magnifying glass should be the size of the box 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.860
 of shoes and better tends to be the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.710
 result 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.950
 the first step is to open a hole in the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.539
 side of the lens size case 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.800
 use the magnifying glass as a guide to make a 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:40.310
 marking with a stylus cutting following 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.250
 the line then fixes magnifying glass in that 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.259
 hole to use electrical tape or if 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.570
 you prefer hot glue to leave the 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.869
 fight well cardboard company 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.180
 now comes the support by cell phone cut a 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.710
 piece of styrofoam the size of the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.380
 shoe box 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.720
 the other cardboard box with the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 Approximate size of your smartphone will 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.220
 serve as support not to fall 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.979
 front or back 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.049
 cut a small part of the front but 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.820
 leaves the side edges to hold the 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:18.230
 device now picks up this little box 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.660
 styrofoam using hot glue as soon as 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.610
 you position the set was the box 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.799
 and a styrofoam with a toothpick. 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.680
 barbecue this will create a mechanism 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.140
 that goes back and what will be very useful 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.630
 to adjust the focus of the image 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.950
 if you prefer, paint the inside of the box 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.390
 with black ink 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.320
 to further improve quality 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.239
 end of the projector another cool option is 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.000
 do a few more holes to use a 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.250
 charger and do not run out of battery 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.639
 cut a small part in the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.220
 cell and passes the shoe box 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.880
 loader through these holes 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.190
 and connect the device is attest 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.640
 a completely dark environment and a 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.590
 preferably white 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.960
 position the box and choose the content to 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.920
 displayed and places the unit in 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.230
 of the bad support here is to leave the image 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.650
 of the smartphone upside down 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.370
 now turn out the lights turn up the volume and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.290
 appreciate your projector operation 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.240
 This equipment is very simple and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.270
 much like what happens in the eye 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.400
 the light emitted by the environment to the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.670
 coming into our eyes forms an image 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.100
 on the retina but upside down for 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.050
 we can interpret the image or 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.450
 our brain reverses all that is 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.480
 captured so that we can see the world of 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.730
 the way he is and there what he 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.740
 our projector built with box 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.900
 magnifying glass and mobile shoe 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.610
 with his help it is possible to do with 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.190
 the images to jump from a 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.820
 5.1 inches to a screen of almost 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.820
 40 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.280
 Cool, do not worry, check it out. 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.769
 the full article of designing on the website 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.769
 from the tecmundo and until the next one to the area 42
