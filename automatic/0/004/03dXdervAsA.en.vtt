fundamentally<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:24.119> rage<00:00:24.449> more

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
fundamentally it's about rage more

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.929 
fundamentally it's about rage more
specifically<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.160> me<00:00:26.310> anyway<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.789> about

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
specifically for me anyway it's about

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.939 
specifically for me anyway it's about
the<00:00:27.269> suppression<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.960> rage<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:28.560> happens

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the suppression of rage and what happens

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.160 
the suppression of rage and what happens
to<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> person<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.760> they're<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.900> allowed<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
to a person when they're not allowed to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.479 
to a person when they're not allowed to
deal<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> emotions<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> feeling

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.229 

the<00:00:38.489> movement<00:00:38.899> itself<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.410> wrong<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the movement itself is wrong and it's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
the movement itself is wrong and it's
very<00:00:42.870> very<00:00:43.140> grounded<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> comes<00:00:44.190> from

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
very very grounded and it comes from

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.479 
very very grounded and it comes from
somewhere<00:00:45.120> within<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.890> movement

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
somewhere within it's not just movement

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.660 
somewhere within it's not just movement
it's<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.570> much<00:00:49.010> inside<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it's there's so much inside that you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.569 
it's there's so much inside that you
have<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.149> relate<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:54.980> it's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> very<00:00:56.190> robust

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
have to relate to it's a very robust

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.260 
have to relate to it's a very robust
work<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.059> very<00:00:58.070> how<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.309> say<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.760> it's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
work it's very how can I say it's it's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.319 
work it's very how can I say it's it's
quite<00:01:00.829> vicious<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.180> know

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
quite vicious in a way and it's you know

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
quite vicious in a way and it's you know
it<00:01:03.710> doesn't<00:01:04.710> hold<00:01:04.830> any<00:01:05.129> punches<00:01:05.489> doesn't<00:01:06.060> hold

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it doesn't hold any punches doesn't hold

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.789 
it doesn't hold any punches doesn't hold
back<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.510> his<00:01:06.600> punches<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.650> much

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
back on his punches so it's very much

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
back on his punches so it's very much
out<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.520> had<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> few<00:01:09.299> concerns

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
out there but I just had a few concerns

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
out there but I just had a few concerns
as<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.400> delicacy<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> where<00:01:12.299> we

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
as to you know the delicacy of where we

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
as to you know the delicacy of where we
are<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.840> an<00:01:12.960> organization<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:13.860> whether

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
are as an organization right now whether

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
are as an organization right now whether
that<00:01:14.460> work<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:14.909> fitting<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:16.020> we've

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that work was really fitting but we've

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.780 
that work was really fitting but we've
managed<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.220> talk<00:01:17.580> around

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
managed to kind of you know talk around

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.170 
managed to kind of you know talk around
how<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.509> remove<00:01:19.500> reshape<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.640> it's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
how we can remove reshape it and it's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.310 
how we can remove reshape it and it's
great<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> physicality<00:01:24.049> will<00:01:25.049> ensure

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
great it's the physicality will ensure

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
great it's the physicality will ensure
that<00:01:25.350> first<00:01:26.189> impresses<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:26.970> dance<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that first impresses me about dance in

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
that first impresses me about dance in
the<00:01:27.630> rest<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the rest of it so I will think about the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.920 
the rest of it so I will think about the
physicality<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.509> I'll<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.869> about

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
physicality and then I'll think about

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
physicality and then I'll think about
the<00:01:31.170> theme<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> hopefully<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> both<00:01:32.909> will

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the theme and hopefully the both will

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.690 
the theme and hopefully the both will
mold<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> basically<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.860> theme<00:01:35.100> basically

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mold and basically the theme basically

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.649 
mold and basically the theme basically
is<00:01:36.500> it's<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.430> rage<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.060> people

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
is it's just the the rage that people

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
is it's just the the rage that people
have<00:01:39.990> within<00:01:40.439> inside<00:01:40.860> them<00:01:41.130> sometimes<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
have within inside them sometimes that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.380 
have within inside them sometimes that
they<00:01:42.210> hide<00:01:42.649> sometimes<00:01:43.649> when<00:01:44.390> they

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
they hide sometimes when they

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
they hide sometimes when they
particularly<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.079> particularly<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
particularly don't particularly want to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
particularly don't particularly want to
hide<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.970> nice<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
hide it but it's nice just to do down to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
hide it but it's nice just to do down to
you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.310> meet<00:01:50.579> somebody<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.329> to

the ideas came from for Beast
well<00:02:08.069> Dougie<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.489> young<00:02:08.610> choreographer<00:02:09.239> he's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
well Dougie for young choreographer he's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
well Dougie for young choreographer he's
I<00:02:10.050> mean<00:02:10.229> he's<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.649> passionate<00:02:10.920> about<00:02:11.250> what<00:02:11.550> he

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
I mean he's so passionate about what he

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.390 
I mean he's so passionate about what he
does<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.890> something<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.040> Doug<00:02:14.220> is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
does and I think something that Doug is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.970 
does and I think something that Doug is
is<00:02:14.670> kind<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> he<00:02:16.019> has<00:02:16.200> challenged<00:02:16.650> me<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
is kind of he has challenged me in a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.040 
is kind of he has challenged me in a
sense<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> feel<00:02:17.970> whereas<00:02:18.810> everyone

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
sense because I feel whereas everyone

first job it's like you all you want to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.259 
first job it's like you all you want to

do is say it's okay we'll find will
we'll<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.629> take<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.019> but<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:35.340> work

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
we'll just take it but actually the work

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.880 
we'll just take it but actually the work
has<00:02:35.790> an<00:02:36.120> undertone<00:02:36.599> which<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.200> felt<00:02:37.470> wasn't

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
has an undertone which I felt wasn't

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
has an undertone which I felt wasn't
quite<00:02:38.099> Phoenix<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:38.910> yeah<00:02:39.810> he<00:02:39.989> gave<00:02:40.170> me<00:02:40.290> my

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410

quite Phoenix so yeah he gave me my
first<00:02:40.440> challenge<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.069> think<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
first challenge I think it's one of

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.030 
first challenge I think it's one of
those<00:02:41.970> pieces<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.329> you<00:02:42.480> can't<00:02:42.900> go<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.680> stage
