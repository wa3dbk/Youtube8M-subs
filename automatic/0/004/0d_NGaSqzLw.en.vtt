don't have to worry about doing that you

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.370 
don't have to worry about doing that you
can<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.299> do<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.719> they're<00:02:05.929> actually<00:02:06.079> designed

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
can to do that they're actually designed

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.979 
can to do that they're actually designed
to<00:02:06.829> do<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.159> because<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.060> motor<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.450> actually

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
to do that because the motor is actually

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.920 
to do that because the motor is actually
inside<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.440> lens<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.000> know<00:02:11.420> some<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.870> the

inside the lens so you know some of the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.790 
inside the lens so you know some of the
modern

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
