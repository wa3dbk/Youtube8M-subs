 he admired many Islamic concepts , right? 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 because of this we have always been 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.070
 created in an environment that was 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.480
 openness to learn about culture 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.610
 about many things my family always 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.829
 was very much linked to culture and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.609
 I know that since childhood so I 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.590
 to repeat in 2010 the exam in 2009 after 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.190
 to read the heart then repeat myself 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.190
 the cause of the Qur'an 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.960
 Do not always ask me. 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.110
 Muslim because you get the chrome 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.640
 I'm not logged in then. 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.010
 I was studying at night, I did not watch you know. 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.300
 me and my sisters in the mosque 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.220
 connection with humans at the same time 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.680
 I tell you that when you went chronic and 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.070
 There have been people who turn away from Islam. 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 It was a wave so a lot of people were very 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.020
 people and then repeated the name as the right not 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.140
 it's worth seeing again 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.800
 at that time was orkut was much facebook 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:55.520
 and open a novel community 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.860
 more than 15 thousand people from the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.420
 community and one day send me an email 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.660
 inviting me to join the community 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.820
 to be an Islamic consultant in 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.520
 community and explain about the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.640
 differences of Islam and what appears in the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.640
 soap opera 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.790
 You're a woman in my life and in Guinea. 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.910
 I'll never leave you this year. 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.250
 I paint in all environments where I do not 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.500
 there are men who are not relatives to me 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 I'm dedicated then, for example, if I 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.080
 I'm here at home I'm not up to me 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.850
 in the mosque for example that has our 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.550
 female sector that the same then people 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.000
 strip the veil stays in shape no problem 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.280
 but if I'm on the street if you have a visit 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.700
 that is a man who is not my brother the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.450
 uncle then I'm always fit you and only 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.580
 clothes size is very cool is this is 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
 very comfortable, never again in my 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.050
 life to the cause or anything because it 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.290
 comfortable I do not know that inside 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.960
 level of scholarship, it's good that I 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.660
 a woman is a meter and a half 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.240
 three tall with green eyes 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.700
 totally different from the average of 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.870
 Brazilian population makes it 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.730
 goes beyond the line of prejudice and turns 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.830
 a tourist attraction is because 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.630
 world wants to talk to me want to take a photo 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.750
 and I find this very good because many 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.430
 sometimes this gives the opportunity to the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.890
 talk to a Muslim woman from 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.270
 know Islam and for me it's very 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.440
 very nice since I 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.440
 I really like talking 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.270
 I was born surrounded by instruments and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.980
 music to everyone at home 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.410
 always listened to a lot of music has always had a 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.720
 I really like the music 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.510
 I started to study music and learn music. 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.430
 in conservatory beginning of the year piano and 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.720
 heavy metal is something that emerged in 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.910
 my life from the moment I 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.400
 my brothers and my cousins ​​began to 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.530
 listen then I met black sabbath and 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.200
 Then I started to meet other bands. 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:17.430
 and I ended up really enjoying it and stocking 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:19.739
 This learn Judas priest this mine. 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.320
 band I think favorite 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.610
 I think the band that I love the most helps 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.100
 When I received the invitation to enter 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.010
 in the band through the vocalist was a 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.890
 just like that 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.230
 ana there that is what is happening 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.940
 It's not like I'm sitting at a table like 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.470
 a friend and he was inviting me 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.770
 painting a band and I'm a 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.750
 Muslim who uses me, everything is over 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.570
 convincing me not to join the band 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.550
 a lot of band a lot work a year 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.010
 creativity and a lot of creation we are 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.780
 recording the band's cd I hope 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.640
 this work of good fruits 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.290
 I hope we can play a lot for 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.650
 then release the album see everyone 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.440
 to go crazy with our music is a 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.090
 for me is something very serious and 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.520
 I devote enough to this study 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.830
 six hours per day of income and not 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.340
 It's because it's a party because it's a profession. 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.340
 serious thing
