00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
think you know from two weeks ago at

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.140 
think you know from two weeks ago at
Stanford<00:03:04.770> where<00:03:04.890> we<00:03:05.040> had<00:03:05.190> some<00:03:05.400> mishaps<00:03:05.670> we

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
Stanford where we had some mishaps we

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.820 
Stanford where we had some mishaps we
had<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> couple<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.750> dropouts<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> heat

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
had a couple of dropouts and the heat

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160 
had a couple of dropouts and the heat
really<00:03:08.070> got<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.550> better<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.820> us<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.239> think

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
really got the better of us I think

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530 
really got the better of us I think
we're<00:03:10.320> much<00:03:10.470> improved<00:03:10.950> from<00:03:11.130> then<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:12.420> know

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
we're much improved from then you know

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.270 
we're much improved from then you know
we're<00:03:12.720> without<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.440> say<00:03:13.620> our<00:03:13.650> top<00:03:14.010> three

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
we're without I would say our top three

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400 
we're without I would say our top three
