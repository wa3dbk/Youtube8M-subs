couple<00:00:10.260> new<00:00:10.500> tricks<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:11.070> its<00:00:11.160> sleeve<00:00:11.309> let's

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
couple new tricks up its sleeve let's

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.290 
couple new tricks up its sleeve let's
get<00:00:12.210> inside<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:19.400> now<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.580> gonna<00:00:20.730> dispense

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
get inside and now I'm gonna dispense

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
get inside and now I'm gonna dispense
with<00:00:21.539> our<00:00:21.660> usual<00:00:21.840> repartee<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.130> through

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
with our usual repartee as we go through

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.040 
with our usual repartee as we go through
every<00:00:23.789> little<00:00:24.029> thing<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> center<00:00:24.750> stack

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
every little thing in the center stack

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140 
every little thing in the center stack
because<00:00:25.410> we've<00:00:25.890> done<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> Highlander<00:00:26.730> before

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
because we've done a Highlander before

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
because we've done a Highlander before
and<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.750> check<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> cab

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in tech discussion today I'm all about

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
in tech discussion today I'm all about
the<00:00:30.990> hybrid<00:00:31.349> powertrain<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> guy<00:00:32.669> cuz<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the hybrid powertrain on this guy cuz it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.580 
the hybrid powertrain on this guy cuz it
has<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> couple<00:00:33.480> tricks<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.899> haven't<00:00:34.170> seen<00:00:34.410> from

Toyota's<00:00:35.100> synergy<00:00:35.460> drive<00:00:35.640> before<00:00:36.030> let's<00:00:36.899> go

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
Toyota's synergy drive before let's go

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.209 
Toyota's synergy drive before let's go
over<00:00:37.110> some<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> numbers<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> engine

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
over some of the numbers on the engine

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.840 
over some of the numbers on the engine
it's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> 3.3<00:00:39.270> liter<00:00:39.440> v6<00:00:40.440> gas<00:00:40.710> engine<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's a 3.3 liter v6 gas engine with a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
it's a 3.3 liter v6 gas engine with a
Wimpy<00:00:42.420> 209<00:00:43.230> horse<00:00:43.530> 212<00:00:44.190> foot-pounds<00:00:44.760> that's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
Wimpy 209 horse 212 foot-pounds that's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.279 
Wimpy 209 horse 212 foot-pounds that's
not<00:00:45.059> gonna<00:00:45.210> move<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> thing<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:45.899> well<00:00:45.989> but

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
not gonna move this thing very well but

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
not gonna move this thing very well but
of<00:00:46.379> course<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> hybrid<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.640> electric

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
of course it's a hybrid two electric

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
of course it's a hybrid two electric
motors<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> front<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> back

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
motors one in the front one in the back

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
motors one in the front one in the back
because<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> vehicle<00:00:50.309> always<00:00:50.940> comes<00:00:51.210> with

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because this vehicle always comes with

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.450 
because this vehicle always comes with
an<00:00:51.570> electronically<00:00:52.230> controlled

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
an electronically controlled

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.889 
an electronically controlled
four-wheel-drive<00:00:53.460> system<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> splits<00:00:54.780> up

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
four-wheel-drive system so it splits up

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.540 
four-wheel-drive system so it splits up
the<00:00:55.079> electric<00:00:55.410> across<00:00:55.680> two<00:00:55.920> motors<00:00:56.219> front<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the electric across two motors front and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.810 
the electric across two motors front and
rear<00:00:56.840> suffice<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.489> plenty<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> torque

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
rear suffice it to say plenty of torque

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.180 
rear suffice it to say plenty of torque
the<00:01:00.539> thing<00:01:00.750> moves<00:01:00.930> very<00:01:01.260> readily<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.949> don't

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the thing moves very readily I don't

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
the thing moves very readily I don't
have<00:01:02.280> any<00:01:02.430> problem<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> power<00:01:03.270> delivery

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
have any problem with the power delivery

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
have any problem with the power delivery
on<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.049> vehicle<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.920> silky<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
on this vehicle it's not just silky it's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
on this vehicle it's not just silky it's
also<00:01:05.790> ample<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.960> once<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> power<00:01:07.500> comes<00:01:07.740> out

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
also ample now once the power comes out

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
also ample now once the power comes out
of<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> powerplant<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:09.150> interesting

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
of that powerplant some interesting

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
of that powerplant some interesting
things<00:01:09.689> happen<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> goes<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.920> through<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
things happen it goes out through a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.740 
things happen it goes out through a
single<00:01:11.670> transmission<00:01:12.150> choice<00:01:12.479> an

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
single transmission choice an

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
single transmission choice an
electronically<00:01:13.320> controlled<00:01:13.520> continuously

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
electronically controlled continuously

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
electronically controlled continuously
variable<00:01:15.000> transmission<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.470> always

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
variable transmission so it's always

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
variable transmission so it's always
seeking<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.400> sweet<00:01:17.640> spot<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.240> gas

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
seeking the sweet spot for the gas

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
seeking the sweet spot for the gas
engine<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.020> gas<00:01:19.200> engines<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.040> if

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
engine because gas engines like that if

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
engine because gas engines like that if
you<00:01:20.310> want<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.790> lean<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> the

understand and you know not up at
freeway<00:01:43.439> speeds<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.549> better<00:01:45.270> than<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> crawl

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

it's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:47.040> way<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> vehicle

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's a great way to use the vehicle

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.190 
it's a great way to use the vehicle
without<00:01:48.180> ever<00:01:48.360> starting<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
without ever starting it one of the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
without ever starting it one of the
examples<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> when<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> move<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> car<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
examples is when you move the car you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
examples is when you move the car you
don't<00:01:51.659> want<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> start<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> engine<00:01:52.680> cold<00:01:53.040> just

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
don't want to start the engine cold just

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.469 
don't want to start the engine cold just
to<00:01:53.490> move<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> across<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.149> street<00:01:54.360> or

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to move it across the street or

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
something just easy it around it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.889 
something just easy it around it's
