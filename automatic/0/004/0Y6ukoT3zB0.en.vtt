not an enemy like any other if you

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.500

within the episodes I'd say give it a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.650 
within the episodes I'd say give it a
chance<00:02:41.769> before<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.400> drop<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.030> or<00:02:43.239> before<00:02:43.569> you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
