00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.790
 this is valentina one of the most comics 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.529
 cautious in Italy the designer is the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.990
 big guido crepax is one that never is 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.600
 fashion past born in the 60s a little 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.620
 transgressive profession photographer has 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.620
 always done on his own 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.010
 do not be surprised to see him on board 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 an alpha romeo spider even if you 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.520
 gave a dreamed sport and the giulietta 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.680
 in this story the stories of the 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 Alfa Romeo cars are often intertwined 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 just like the episodes of valentine 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:11.330
 and 1966 when the alpha romeo was born 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.509
 spider in the arese milano factory ma 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.310
 let's take a few steps back 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.590
 already in the mid- fifties the alpha 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.090
 he understood that his 1900 was too much 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 challenging for the pockets of 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.909
 consumers 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.549
 so he decided to produce a car 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.229
 smaller and less expensive but full of 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.380
 appeal 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.710
 and so that in 1954 the Juliet appears 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.610
 sprint with a four-cylinder engine from 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.950
 1290 cc 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.200
 the sports version has suffered great 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.530
 success the sedan will only come one 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.530
 year later 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.319
 and it's from the special Juliet sprint 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.929
 the one driven by valentina from crepax 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.630
 that you get to the spider alfa romeo 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.890
 of the 60s but the whole world 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.890
 will know by the name of 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 this name is intended to enter the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.750
 legend comes out with a contest 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.750
 banished from the snake house 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.330
 the production of the duet covered three 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.399
 decades 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.300
 the first model was also nicknamed 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.310
 cuttlebone for the elusive curve but 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.170
 if valentina does not age too 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.769
 spider of the alpha romeo does not put one 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.840
 wrinkle 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.819
 indeed perhaps rejuvenates through i 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.489
 various restyling that can be summarized 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.489
 in land 17 models signed pininfarina 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.200
 in 1968 the first evolution of the two 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.720
 placed under the alfa romeo brand is the 1750 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.430
 fast spider 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.260
 a year later comes the version with a 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.500
 clean cut of the back known 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.750
 with the name of truncated tail it is necessary 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.880
 get to 1983 for the version 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.319
 characterized by the gumming in the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.360
 aerodynamic rear spoiler in the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.459
 1986 a further evolution of this 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.200
 model with side skirts came 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.200
 called green four-leaf clover 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.870
 the duet is a car that creates it 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.690
 an imaginary movie icon returns 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.910
 Libyans as a graduate is the symbol of 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.910
 an era of speed and well-being 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.260
 but it's not up to ge.sa fard and we're talking about 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.599
 motorization 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.640
 the great protagonist of this 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.010
 classical and the exuberant double shaft of the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.730
 gtv available over the years 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.989
 in the 1200 1300 1700 50 and 2000 versions 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.299
 the elasticity of the motor offers rapid 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.860
 shooting and good acceleration but it is 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.540
 road holding reliability 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.670
 which has always remained constant over time 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.720
 the wheels remain glued to the ground in 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.720
 any situation 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.140
 interior finishes and coatings 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.820
 they are of excellent quality 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.340
 the sports cabin is full of charm 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.160
 even in small details like the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.360
 Nardi-type three-spoke steering wheel 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.360
 characterized by a wooden crown 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.380
 the final chapter of the history of 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.810
 duet is written between 1990 and 1995 e 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.450
 then the last of the 124 thousand specimens 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.030
 created during his thirty year race 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.060
 leaves the factory 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.830
 the last or elegant characterized by 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.800
 front badge to the negative 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.780
 who bought it bought a new car 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.220
 which was actually a vintage car 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.220
 for enthusiasts 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.820
 production stopped but history 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.919
 of the duet does not end here as the 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.300
 story of valentina who read them every 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.300
 time they were always new
