00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.009
 Games in preparation are only 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.660
 Tests and still hung after the game 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 the heads of the Schalke professionals straight 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.710
 friendly matches against top opponents like 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.809
 the table guide bavaria munich should 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 give information about where it is still 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.730
 is missing and have the southern German at 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 the 0 5-defeat the royal blue 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 Above all, the switching shows 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 movement from us had the rooms 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 approved for bavaria that was that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 problem not necessarily 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.300
 Combination football They just have it 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.869
 cleverly understood or with high 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 tempo the switching game especially in the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.530
 offensive and there we have bad 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 fell over and as we said we have the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 space is too big and that is allowed 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 not happen we have to get in faster 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 the order and the switching game in the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.340
 same same one same 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.809
 bring speed as it too 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 brought bavaria munich 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.649
 Nevertheless, we have against opponents 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.000
 played if you have seen the yes 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.350
 second half almost complete 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
 replaced and there was still standing 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 a world class team and we are 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.059
 currently we are on the staff 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.489
 gums 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.690
 I was glad that one or the other 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 player ever held today 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.640
 but of course I can with the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.619
 result of the way then not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 be satisfied 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.560
 It went really well schalke 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
 combined safe and at the beginning 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 worked out three good ones 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.580
 chances but the success remained and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 nevertheless I think we have very good 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.970
 The first 15 minutes have begun 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 he has also moved japan already 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.680
 said that he put a lot of pressure 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 front aggressively gone 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.550
 and we also have two or three good ones 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 worked out possibilities 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.300
 only then did we miss the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.980
 to keep the team compact against 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.770
 We can not reach Bavaria over 45 minutes 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.180
 run on it and then was with us 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.440
 the vote not because of a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 or other players went on the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.520
 others did not follow 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 but then the bavaria found in the of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.080
 Schalke involuntarily created 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.040
 free spaces to their usual strong 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.320
 combination football especially franck 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.479
 ribÃ©ry ran to top form and was 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.590
 from schalkes defensive only in the rarest 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.729
 case to stop 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.660
 Accordingly, the mood is bad 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.660
 with the players that you do not get 5 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.280
 0-defeat here afford it is that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.380
 not possible that should not happen 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 above all we are a team yes 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.140
 also like dynatrace and want and away 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.879
 then 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.310
 so many blatant mistakes to do that 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.019
 Of course, that is not possible for Schalke 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.299
 At least one more chance at the end 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.549
 worked out is a good sign two 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.409
 Training days stay here in Qatar days 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.480
 who still wants to use the team 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.040
 The direction is clear and so on 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 game has to get better we have to 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 more aggressive than team 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.340
 work the way you did the first 15 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.140
 minutes on top have gone like this 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.110
 we have to do it in midfield or in 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.209
 in the last third of us work and 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.620
 Of course, that's what it's all about in the 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.620
 to work next day
