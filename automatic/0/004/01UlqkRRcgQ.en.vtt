00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the field effects in New Guinea I've got

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.230 
the field effects in New Guinea I've got
a<00:00:08.300> simple<00:00:09.300> scene<00:00:09.540> here<00:00:10.639> which<00:00:11.639> I've<00:00:11.969> set<00:00:12.150> up

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
a simple scene here which I've set up

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.010 
a simple scene here which I've set up
already<00:00:12.500> there's<00:00:13.500> grid<00:00:14.750> southall<00:00:15.750> plane

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
already there's grid southall plane

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.760 
already there's grid southall plane
we've<00:00:16.770> got<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> row<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.279> spheres<00:00:18.500> I've<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
we've got a row of spheres I've got a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
we've got a row of spheres I've got a
distant<00:00:20.279> light<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.970> illuminate<00:00:21.119> seen<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.810> live

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
distant light to illuminate seen a live

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
distant light to illuminate seen a live
got<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> camera<00:00:24.199> which<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.590> showing<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.310> robes

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
got a camera which is showing the robes

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.080 
got a camera which is showing the robes
fears<00:00:28.130> also<00:00:29.130> set<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> couple<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> materials

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fears also set up a couple of materials

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.069 
fears also set up a couple of materials
I've<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> clay<00:00:30.689> material<00:00:31.369> almost<00:00:32.369> fears

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
I've got a clay material almost fears

to<00:00:37.920> make<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.190> example<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.090> clearer<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.480> want

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to make this example bit clearer I want

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.010 
to make this example bit clearer I want
to<00:00:39.870> add<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.579> color<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.850> each<00:00:42.030> sphere<00:00:42.570> that's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to add a color to each sphere that's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.040 
to add a color to each sphere that's
different<00:00:43.710> i'm<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.180> using<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
different i'm going to do that using a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
different i'm going to do that using a
primitive<00:00:46.950> assault<00:00:48.950> what<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> primitive<00:00:50.489> sub

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
primitive assault what a primitive sub

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
primitive assault what a primitive sub
allows<00:00:51.420> me<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> do<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> attribute's<00:00:52.590> tab

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
allows me to do on the attribute's tab

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.450 
allows me to do on the attribute's tab
here<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.879> cover<00:00:54.680> let's<00:00:55.680> enlarge<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
here is and cover let's enlarge this I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.860 
here is and cover let's enlarge this I
can<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> mirror<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:58.579> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> add<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.510> color

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
can see the mirror I want to add a color

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
can see the mirror I want to add a color
which<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.379> different<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.949> each<00:01:02.100> sphere

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
which is different for each sphere

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140 
which is different for each sphere
primitive<00:01:04.580> functional<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.790> fairly<00:01:06.030> easy

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
primitive functional do is fairly easy

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.310 
primitive functional do is fairly easy
way<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.310> which<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> random

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
way to do this which is to use a random

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.789 
way to do this which is to use a random
color<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.729> function<00:01:12.150> rammed<00:01:12.590> creates<00:01:13.590> around

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
color the function rammed creates around

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.090 
color the function rammed creates around
another<00:01:14.189> team<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:15.200> but<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> creates<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
another team or one but it creates the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
another team or one but it creates the
number<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.150> deterministic<00:01:18.479> fashion<00:01:19.320> based

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
number in a deterministic fashion based

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.810 
number in a deterministic fashion based
on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.250> value<00:01:21.030> give<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.659> its<00:01:22.020> parameter<00:01:22.820> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
on the value give it as its parameter so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
on the value give it as its parameter so
if<00:01:23.970> i<00:01:24.090> give<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.299> dollar<00:01:24.630> PR<00:01:25.049> which<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
if i give it dollar PR which is the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.999 
if i give it dollar PR which is the
primitive<00:01:26.460> number<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.380> each<00:01:28.470> primitive

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
primitive number then for each primitive

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
primitive number then for each primitive
it<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.400> create<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:30.030> different<00:01:30.780> color<00:01:31.680> i<00:01:33.560> do

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it will create a different color i do

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.630 
it will create a different color i do
the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> green<00:01:35.640> complainant<00:01:37.640> but

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the same for the green complainant but

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
the same for the green complainant but
we<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.060> dollar<00:01:39.240> PR<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
we don't want dollar PR because that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.100 
we don't want dollar PR because that
would<00:01:40.110> give<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.650> same<00:01:40.829> value<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.220> green<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
would give the same value for green and

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.290 
would give the same value for green and
red<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
red so we just

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.930 
red so we just
anything<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.620> it<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> different<00:01:47.640> number

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
anything to it make a different number

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.430 
anything to it make a different number
and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.290> finally<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.980> same<00:01:50.810> for<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.260> blue

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
and then finally the same for the blue

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.650 
and then finally the same for the blue
component<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> we've<00:01:58.920> got<00:01:59.100> three<00:01:59.660> different

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
component so we've got three different

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.980 
component so we've got three different
random<00:02:01.530> numbers<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.360> deed<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> random

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
random numbers and the deed got a random

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.490 
random numbers and the deed got a random
color<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> values<00:02:06.230> if<00:02:07.230> we<00:02:07.350> look

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
color you can see the values if we look

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.609 
color you can see the values if we look
back<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.830> our<00:02:07.920> scene<00:02:08.930> each<00:02:09.930> of<00:02:10.140> these<00:02:10.260> spheres

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
back at our scene each of these spheres

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.940 
back at our scene each of these spheres
has<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.880> different<00:02:12.210> color<00:02:14.000> some<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.120> them<00:02:15.270> see

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
has a different color some of them see

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.080 
has a different color some of them see
what<00:02:16.950> that's<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.250> when<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.670> ramen

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
what that's like when it's ramen

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.960 
what that's like when it's ramen
rendered<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> I'll<00:02:20.190> lay<00:02:20.310> down<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> mantra

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
rendered so I'll lay down the mantra

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.720 
rendered so I'll lay down the mantra
node<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.530> then<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.740> render<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> scene

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.009 

well<00:02:31.590> we've<00:02:32.590> got<00:02:32.769> our<00:02:32.890> different<00:02:33.370> covers<00:02:34.019> no

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
well we've got our different covers no

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.330 
well we've got our different covers no
depth<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.590> feel<00:02:35.739> this<00:02:35.920> yet<00:02:37.860> why<00:02:38.860> does<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.159> work

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
depth to feel this yet why does it work

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.559 
depth to feel this yet why does it work
at<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.540> coloring<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.140> spheres<00:02:41.470> well

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
at the the coloring of the spheres well

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.869 
at the the coloring of the spheres well
just<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.659> quick<00:02:43.840> digression<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.709> explain<00:02:45.640> that

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
just a quick digression to explain that

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.440 
just a quick digression to explain that
on<00:02:46.659> our<00:02:46.720> clay<00:02:47.470> shader<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.250> we've<00:02:49.150> got<00:02:49.330> an

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
on our clay shader here we've got an

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.580 
on our clay shader here we've got an
option<00:02:49.780> use<00:02:50.140> point<00:02:50.530> color<00:02:52.019> which<00:02:53.019> is<00:02:53.049> selected

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
option use point color which is selected

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.839 
option use point color which is selected
so<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.720> shader<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.080> looking<00:02:56.379> for<00:02:56.849> attributes

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
so the shader is looking for attributes

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.350 
so the shader is looking for attributes
on<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.810> points<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:03:00.400> relatives<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.209> are

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
on the points of the relatives that are

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.809 
on the points of the relatives that are
being<00:03:01.569> shaded<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.980> looking<00:03:03.310> for<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.519> color

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
being shaded it's looking for a color

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.430 
being shaded it's looking for a color
attribute<00:03:04.769> let's<00:03:05.769> have<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.980> look<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.340> our

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
attribute let's have a look at our

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.569 
attribute let's have a look at our
sphere<00:03:08.730> your<00:03:09.730> objects<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:11.379> I've<00:03:11.560> got<00:03:11.799> five

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
sphere your objects and I've got five

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.180 
sphere your objects and I've got five
details<00:03:13.569> view<00:03:13.870> here<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:17.260> allows<00:03:17.440> us<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.950> see

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
details view here that allows us to see

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.430 
details view here that allows us to see
the<00:03:18.220> attributes<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.060> are<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:20.019> points

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
the attributes that are on the points

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.720 
the attributes that are on the points
and<00:03:20.680> someone<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.849> of<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.269> object<00:03:23.730> so

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and someone of this of this object so

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.360 
and someone of this of this object so
here<00:03:24.879> we<00:03:25.000> are<00:03:25.120> at<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.569> point<00:03:25.870> level<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.129> we

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
here we are at the point level and we

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.030 
here we are at the point level and we
can<00:03:27.519> see<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:29.349> we've<00:03:29.470> got<00:03:29.500> position

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
can see that and then we've got position

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.880 
can see that and then we've got position
information<00:03:30.250> we<00:03:30.609> don't<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.000> color<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:32.680> got

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
information we don't have a color we got

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.370 
information we don't have a color we got
to<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.579> primitive<00:03:33.819> level<00:03:34.150> we<00:03:34.750> do<00:03:34.930> have<00:03:35.139> a<00:03:35.169> half

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
to the primitive level we do have a half

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.309 
to the primitive level we do have a half
color<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.790> what<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.150> CD<00:03:37.569> attribute<00:03:38.139> is

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
color that's what this CD attribute is

components<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.530> cover<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.579> added<00:03:45.730> those

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
components of cover and we added those

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.620 
components of cover and we added those
using<00:03:46.389> this<00:03:46.480> primitive<00:03:46.780> sob<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.730> how<00:03:48.940> then

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
using this primitive sob so how then

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.949 
using this primitive sob so how then
does<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.049> shader<00:03:50.410> find<00:03:51.099> this<00:03:52.030> at<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
does the shader find this at the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.270 
does the shader find this at the
primitive<00:03:53.319> level<00:03:53.410> we're<00:03:53.829> looking<00:03:54.160> at<00:03:54.220> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
primitive level we're looking at the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.909 
primitive level we're looking at the
point<00:03:54.519> level<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.840> answer<00:03:56.139> is<00:03:56.169> that<00:03:56.319> if<00:03:56.799> it

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
point level the answer is that if it

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.589 
point level the answer is that if it
doesn't<00:03:57.280> fired<00:03:57.519> at<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.819> point<00:03:58.000> level<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.389> and

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
doesn't fired at the point level it and

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.319 
doesn't fired at the point level it and
looks<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.799> vertex<00:04:00.010> tribute<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.880> then<00:04:01.299> a

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
looks for vertex tribute and then a

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.120 
looks for vertex tribute and then a
primitive<00:04:01.810> in<00:04:01.900> tribute<00:04:02.139> finally<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.739> detail<00:04:03.099> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
primitive in tribute finally a detail a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.280 
primitive in tribute finally a detail a
tribute<00:04:03.569> even<00:04:04.569> though<00:04:04.690> we<00:04:04.840> don't<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.079> color

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
tribute even though we don't have color

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.289 
tribute even though we don't have color
at<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.470> point<00:04:05.709> level<00:04:05.859> it's<00:04:06.639> successfully

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
at the point level it's successfully

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.580 
at the point level it's successfully
finding<00:04:07.690> those<00:04:07.840> attributes<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
finding those attributes of the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.330 
finding those attributes of the
primitive<00:04:08.919> level

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.300 

so<00:04:12.930> enabling<00:04:13.930> depth<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.290> field<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> two-step

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
so enabling depth of field is a two-step

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.319 
so enabling depth of field is a two-step
process<00:04:15.989> first<00:04:16.989> step<00:04:17.320> need<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.889> select<00:04:18.329> our

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
process first step need to select our

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.230 
process first step need to select our
camera<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.739> move<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.160> view<00:04:21.400> round<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:22.090> that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
camera and move the view round so that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.170 
camera and move the view round so that
we<00:04:22.360> can<00:04:22.510> see<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:23.070> make<00:04:24.070> sure<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:24.699> select

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
we can see it make sure that this select

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.480 
we can see it make sure that this select
handle<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:27.180> selected<00:04:28.800> use<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.830> different<00:04:32.490> able

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
handle is selected use a different able

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.920 
handle is selected use a different able
to<00:04:33.610> start<00:04:33.790> with<00:04:34.770> which<00:04:35.770> we<00:04:36.010> can<00:04:36.040> find<00:04:36.430> by

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
to start with which we can find by

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.620 
to start with which we can find by
right-clicking<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.830> camera<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:40.300> can<00:04:40.479> see

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
right-clicking on the camera you can see

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.270 
right-clicking on the camera you can see
we're<00:04:40.810> given<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.110> choice<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.620> three<00:04:41.680> handles

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
we're given a choice of three handles

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.460 
we're given a choice of three handles
the<00:04:42.400> orientation<00:04:43.150> handle<00:04:43.510> which<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.350> one

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
the orientation handle which is the one

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.650 
the orientation handle which is the one
we're<00:04:44.650> showing<00:04:44.889> at<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.130> moment<00:04:45.460> focus<00:04:46.330> handle

we're showing at the moment focus handle

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.020 
we're showing at the moment focus handle
and<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.110> frost<00:04:47.380> from<00:04:47.590> handle<00:04:47.919> not<00:04:48.760> going<00:04:48.970> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
and the frost from handle not going to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.430 
and the frost from handle not going to
worry<00:04:49.180> about<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.540> frost<00:04:49.780> remodel<00:04:50.229> in<00:04:50.320> this

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
worry about the frost remodel in this

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.670 
worry about the frost remodel in this
lesson<00:04:51.540> but<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.630> focus<00:04:52.870> handle<00:04:53.290> displayed

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
lesson but the focus handle displayed

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
lesson but the focus handle displayed
here<00:04:54.330> is<00:04:55.330> not<00:04:55.630> very<00:04:56.260> easy<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.710> see<00:04:56.950> but<00:04:57.280> what

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
here is not very easy to see but what

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.300 
here is not very easy to see but what
we've<00:04:57.880> essentially<00:04:58.270> got<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:59.010> a<00:05:00.010> manipulator

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
we've essentially got is a manipulator

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.370 
we've essentially got is a manipulator
here<00:05:00.970> which<00:05:01.180> allows<00:05:01.510> us<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.840> position<00:05:02.169> the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
here which allows us to position the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.890 
here which allows us to position the
center<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.770> interest<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.370> camera

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
center of interest of the camera

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.790 
center of interest of the camera
manipulator<00:05:04.900> here<00:05:05.169> that<00:05:05.350> allows<00:05:05.500> us<00:05:05.680> to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
manipulator here that allows us to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.610 
manipulator here that allows us to
position<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.250> camera<00:05:06.400> itself<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.960> rotation

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
position the camera itself to rotation

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.570 
position the camera itself to rotation
manipulators<00:05:09.250> this<00:05:10.090> one<00:05:10.360> rotates<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.580> center

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
manipulators this one rotates the center

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.379 
manipulators this one rotates the center
of<00:05:12.610> interest<00:05:13.800> around<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.100> camera<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.820> this

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
of interest around the camera and this

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.310 
of interest around the camera and this
one<00:05:16.630> rotates<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.229> camera<00:05:17.530> Alice<00:05:17.800> interest

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
one rotates the camera Alice interest

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.909 
one rotates the camera Alice interest
now<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:21.220> effect<00:05:21.520> on<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.880> achieve<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.919> make

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
now the effect on to achieve is to make

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.980 
now the effect on to achieve is to make
this<00:05:25.080> light<00:05:26.080> brown<00:05:27.090> sphere<00:05:28.090> in<00:05:28.360> focus<00:05:28.780> and

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
this light brown sphere in focus and

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.550 
this light brown sphere in focus and
other<00:05:29.289> spheres<00:05:30.250> more<00:05:30.460> or<00:05:30.520> less<00:05:30.639> out<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:30.940> focus

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
other spheres more or less out of focus

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.640 
other spheres more or less out of focus
so<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.650> first<00:05:32.889> step<00:05:33.039> is<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:34.090> move<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:35.260> central

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
so the first step is to move the central

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.370 
so the first step is to move the central
interests<00:05:36.010> of<00:05:36.099> the<00:05:36.160> camera<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:38.139> is

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.089 

focused<00:05:41.380> on<00:05:41.530> that<00:05:42.360> sphere<00:05:43.360> there<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.710> if<00:05:44.889> I

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
focused on that sphere there so if I

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.820 
focused on that sphere there so if I
move<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:47.740> you<00:05:48.700> know<00:05:48.880> that's<00:05:49.150> more<00:05:49.419> or<00:05:49.450> less

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
move and you know that's more or less

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.630 
move and you know that's more or less
focused<00:05:50.830> on<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.130> sphere

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
focused on the sphere

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.360 
focused on the sphere
next<00:05:53.640> step<00:05:53.820> is<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:55.490> select<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.820> focus<00:05:57.210> handle

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
next step is to select the focus handle

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.920 
next step is to select the focus handle
which<00:05:59.370> we<00:05:59.490> can<00:05:59.640> do<00:05:59.760> by<00:06:00.060> right-clicking<00:06:00.630> on<00:06:00.870> the

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
which we can do by right-clicking on the

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.180 
which we can do by right-clicking on the
camera<00:06:01.410> or<00:06:02.100> by<00:06:02.430> using<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.180> Z<00:06:03.360> key<00:06:04.010> what<00:06:05.010> this

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
camera or by using the Z key what this

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.470 
camera or by using the Z key what this
produces<00:06:05.730> is<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.720> lime<00:06:07.320> from<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.770> camera

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
produces is a lime from the camera

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.300 
produces is a lime from the camera
through<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.510> center<00:06:10.350> of<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.500> dress<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:11.040> out

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
through the center of the dress and out

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.810 
through the center of the dress and out
to<00:06:11.520> infinity<00:06:12.560> there<00:06:13.560> are<00:06:13.650> two<00:06:13.830> arrows<00:06:14.280> on<00:06:14.610> this

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
to infinity there are two arrows on this

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.540 
to infinity there are two arrows on this
line<00:06:15.030> which<00:06:15.390> show<00:06:16.290> you<00:06:16.350> what<00:06:16.740> is<00:06:17.040> going<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:17.400> be

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
line which show you what is going to be

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
line which show you what is going to be
in<00:06:17.760> focus<00:06:19.370> in<00:06:20.370> fact<00:06:20.610> we<00:06:20.760> can<00:06:20.880> only<00:06:21.000> see<00:06:21.240> one<00:06:21.450> of

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
in focus in fact we can only see one of

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.790 
in focus in fact we can only see one of
the<00:06:21.660> areas<00:06:21.930> at<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.080> moment<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.470> other<00:06:22.650> one<00:06:22.770> is

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
the areas at the moment the other one is

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.420 
the areas at the moment the other one is
way<00:06:23.130> too<00:06:23.190> off<00:06:23.520> at<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.120> end<00:06:24.210> of<00:06:24.300> this<00:06:24.420> line<00:06:25.430> but

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
way too off at the end of this line but

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.910 
way too off at the end of this line but
we<00:06:26.940> can<00:06:27.150> tell<00:06:27.390> already<00:06:27.600> that<00:06:27.840> all<00:06:28.530> of<00:06:28.800> these

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
we can tell already that all of these

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.450 
we can tell already that all of these
fears<00:06:29.340> that<00:06:30.150> going<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.420> be<00:06:30.510> in<00:06:30.570> focus<00:06:31.370> it's<00:06:32.370> not

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
fears that going to be in focus it's not

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.160 
fears that going to be in focus it's not
what<00:06:32.610> we<00:06:32.790> want<00:06:33.000> we<00:06:33.180> want<00:06:33.210> quite<00:06:33.570> a<00:06:33.600> sharp<00:06:33.930> focus

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
what we want we want quite a sharp focus

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.390 
what we want we want quite a sharp focus
on<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:35.780> iran<00:06:36.780> says<00:06:37.080> if<00:06:37.290> we<00:06:37.440> move<00:06:37.710> this<00:06:38.040> handle

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
on the iran says if we move this handle

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.950 
on the iran says if we move this handle
down<00:06:40.760> we<00:06:41.760> can<00:06:41.940> now<00:06:42.090> see<00:06:42.360> the<00:06:42.390> other<00:06:42.600> handle

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
down we can now see the other handle

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.470 
down we can now see the other handle
here<00:06:43.200> so<00:06:43.410> we've<00:06:43.530> got<00:06:43.650> two<00:06:43.830> handles<00:06:44.330> and<00:06:45.330> that

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
here so we've got two handles and that

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.080 
here so we've got two handles and that
shows<00:06:45.870> that<00:06:45.900> more<00:06:46.890> or<00:06:47.040> less<00:06:47.100> just<00:06:47.220> that<00:06:47.730> sphere

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
shows that more or less just that sphere

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.230 
shows that more or less just that sphere
will<00:06:48.270> be<00:06:48.390> in<00:06:48.480> focus<00:06:49.610> let's<00:06:50.610> render<00:06:50.850> that<00:06:51.060> and

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
will be in focus let's render that and

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.610 
will be in focus let's render that and
see<00:06:51.360> what<00:06:51.480> we<00:06:51.600> get

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.350 

well<00:06:58.620> we're<00:06:58.830> still<00:06:59.010> getting<00:06:59.160> all<00:07:00.060> of<00:07:00.240> those

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
well we're still getting all of those

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.470 
well we're still getting all of those
fears<00:07:00.630> in<00:07:00.900> focus<00:07:01.850> the<00:07:02.850> reason<00:07:03.150> for<00:07:03.180> that<00:07:03.330> is

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
fears in focus the reason for that is

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.630 
fears in focus the reason for that is
that<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:04.050> second<00:07:04.440> step<00:07:04.680> that<00:07:04.950> you<00:07:05.040> need<00:07:05.280> to<00:07:05.490> do

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
that the second step that you need to do

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.770 
that the second step that you need to do
to<00:07:05.670> enable<00:07:06.120> depth<00:07:07.110> of<00:07:07.290> field<00:07:07.590> is<00:07:08.490> to<00:07:09.000> set<00:07:09.630> some

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
to enable depth of field is to set some

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.170 
to enable depth of field is to set some
properties<00:07:09.930> on<00:07:10.320> your<00:07:10.440> mantra<00:07:10.770> node<00:07:11.180> the

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
properties on your mantra node the

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.060 
properties on your mantra node the
properties<00:07:12.630> drab<00:07:13.310> under<00:07:14.310> samples<00:07:15.890> you<00:07:16.890> need

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
properties drab under samples you need

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.510 
properties drab under samples you need
to<00:07:17.310> enable<00:07:18.000> depth<00:07:18.450> of<00:07:18.600> field<00:07:19.130> you<00:07:20.130> also<00:07:20.250> may

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
to enable depth of field you also may

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.260 
to enable depth of field you also may
want<00:07:20.730> to<00:07:20.910> up<00:07:21.630> the<00:07:22.320> number<00:07:22.710> of<00:07:22.830> Excel<00:07:23.820> samples

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
want to up the number of Excel samples

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.780 
want to up the number of Excel samples
to<00:07:24.960> get<00:07:25.110> slightly<00:07:25.650> smoother<00:07:26.130> effect<00:07:28.250> so<00:07:29.250> let's

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:29.790 
to get slightly smoother effect so let's

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:37.080 
to get slightly smoother effect so let's
render<00:07:30.090> it<00:07:30.300> again

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.640 

and<00:07:37.590> we<00:07:38.590> can<00:07:38.740> already<00:07:38.889> see<00:07:39.280> that<00:07:40.290> we<00:07:41.290> getting<00:07:41.560> a

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
and we can already see that we getting a

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.800 
and we can already see that we getting a
nice<00:07:41.800> sharp<00:07:42.460> focus<00:07:42.699> on<00:07:43.150> the<00:07:43.360> slide<00:07:43.570> brown

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
nice sharp focus on the slide brown

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.060 
nice sharp focus on the slide brown
sphere<00:07:44.729> and<00:07:45.729> the<00:07:45.790> sphere<00:07:45.880> is<00:07:46.270> either<00:07:46.510> side<00:07:47.070> are

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070 
sphere and the sphere is either side are
