uh<00:00:13.840> kind<00:00:14.840> of<00:00:14.900> thing<00:00:15.050> I<00:00:15.140> think<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.380> first<00:00:15.410> guy

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
uh kind of thing I think the first guy

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.650 
uh kind of thing I think the first guy
trained<00:00:16.160> for<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.400> NFL<00:00:16.700> Combine<00:00:17.150> was<00:00:17.360> built

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
trained for the NFL Combine was built

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.230 
trained for the NFL Combine was built
Brooks<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.200> I'm<00:00:18.290> gonna<00:00:18.440> say<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.890> was<00:00:19.240> 1984

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
Brooks and I'm gonna say that was 1984

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.190 
Brooks and I'm gonna say that was 1984
so<00:00:21.170> if<00:00:21.260> we're<00:00:21.410> thinking<00:00:21.970> 84<00:00:22.970> 2026<00:00:23.779> years<00:00:24.020> maybe

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
so if we're thinking 84 2026 years maybe

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.140 
so if we're thinking 84 2026 years maybe
I<00:00:24.380> don't<00:00:24.500> know<00:00:24.710> it<00:00:25.430> was<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.610> long<00:00:25.790> time<00:00:26.000> ago

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
I don't know it was a long time ago

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.080 
I don't know it was a long time ago
actually<00:00:27.040> Pete<00:00:28.040> Williams<00:00:28.250> in<00:00:28.550> saying<00:00:29.000> this

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
actually Pete Williams in saying this

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.640 
actually Pete Williams in saying this
book<00:00:29.329> called<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.720> draft<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.259> Pete<00:00:30.439> Williams

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
book called the draft and Pete Williams

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.220 
book called the draft and Pete Williams
in<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.220> book<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.610> draft<00:00:31.880> gives<00:00:32.720> me<00:00:32.900> credit

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
in the book the draft gives me credit

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.750 
in the book the draft gives me credit
for<00:00:33.350> inventing<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.950> idea<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.400> combine

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
for inventing the idea of the combine

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.250 
for inventing the idea of the combine
camp<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.090> think<00:00:35.270> we<00:00:35.329> were<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.510> first<00:00:35.720> people<00:00:35.900> to

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
camp I think we were the first people to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.310 
camp I think we were the first people to
ever<00:00:36.520> bring<00:00:37.520> athletes<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.239> from<00:00:38.630> out<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.810> state

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
ever bring athletes in from out of state

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.440 
ever bring athletes in from out of state
put<00:00:39.530> them<00:00:39.710> up<00:00:39.920> house<00:00:40.250> them<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.790> beat<00:00:40.970> them<00:00:41.239> and

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
put them up house them to beat them and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.180 
put them up house them to beat them and
train<00:00:41.720> them<00:00:41.750> for<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.140> NFL<00:00:42.470> Combine<00:00:42.860> I<00:00:43.010> think

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
train them for the NFL Combine I think

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.420 
train them for the NFL Combine I think
that<00:00:43.399> was<00:00:43.660> probably<00:00:44.739> 1995<00:00:45.739> which<00:00:46.070> was<00:00:46.190> about

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
that was probably 1995 which was about

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.360 
that was probably 1995 which was about
10<00:00:46.670> years<00:00:46.879> after<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:47.269> started<00:00:47.809> actually

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.729 

I<00:00:52.809> think<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.899> big<00:00:54.050> thing<00:00:54.079> they<00:00:54.289> can<00:00:54.440> expect

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
I think the big thing they can expect

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.130 
I think the big thing they can expect
here<00:00:55.070> one<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:56.000> really<00:00:56.270> get<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.629> understand

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
here one is to really get to understand

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.979 
here one is to really get to understand
the<00:00:57.890> process<00:00:58.520> of<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.820> events<00:00:59.269> it's<00:00:59.420> funny<00:00:59.719> now

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
the process of the events it's funny now

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.250 
the process of the events it's funny now
there's<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.410> really<00:01:00.680> big<00:01:00.860> emphasis<00:01:01.070> on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
there's a really big emphasis on

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.359 
there's a really big emphasis on
position<00:01:03.260> drills<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.040> lot<00:01:04.190> of<00:01:04.220> these

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
position drills and a lot of these

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.800 
position drills and a lot of these
places<00:01:04.580> run<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:04.970> like<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.089> day<00:01:05.299> camp<00:01:05.570> but<00:01:05.750> they

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
places run it like a day camp but they

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.390 
places run it like a day camp but they
try<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.020> keep<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.350> kids<00:01:06.560> busy<00:01:06.799> all<00:01:07.130> day<00:01:07.159> and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
try to keep the kids busy all day and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.040 
try to keep the kids busy all day and
you're<00:01:07.640> going<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.850> do<00:01:07.940> this<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.479> we're<00:01:08.930> going

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
you're going to do this and we're going

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.120 
you're going to do this and we're going
to<00:01:09.080> bring<00:01:09.229> in<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.440> position<00:01:09.619> coach<00:01:09.890> we're<00:01:10.040> not

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
to bring in a position coach we're not

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.170

this is the big job interview and when
you<00:01:24.170> go<00:01:24.380> there<00:01:24.410> there's<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.310> very<00:01:25.340> specific<00:01:26.149> set

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
you go there there's a very specific set

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.389 
you go there there's a very specific set
of<00:01:26.810> skills<00:01:27.259> that<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.619> haven't<00:01:28.009> worked<00:01:28.190> on

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
of skills that you haven't worked on

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.190 
of skills that you haven't worked on
football<00:01:29.300> something<00:01:29.690> you've<00:01:29.810> worked<00:01:29.960> on

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
football something you've worked on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.350 
football something you've worked on
extensively<00:01:30.640> but<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.729> haven't<00:01:31.910> spent<00:01:32.240> the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
extensively but you haven't spent the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.419 
extensively but you haven't spent the
time<00:01:32.600> preparing<00:01:33.560> for<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.770> actual<00:01:34.070> drill<00:01:34.280> so

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
time preparing for the actual drill so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.160 
time preparing for the actual drill so
most<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.850> our<00:01:34.970> emphasis<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.570> going<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.899> be<00:01:36.020> on

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
most of our emphasis is going to be on

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.800 
most of our emphasis is going to be on
getting<00:01:37.100> ready<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.149> do<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.450> drills<00:01:38.720> that

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
getting ready to do the drills that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
getting ready to do the drills that
you're<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.289> at<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> convoy

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 

I<00:01:44.789> think<00:01:45.329> they'll<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
I think they'll do actually I you know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.529 
I think they'll do actually I you know
our<00:01:46.619> our<00:01:47.189> record<00:01:47.610> speaks<00:01:47.969> for<00:01:48.060> itself<00:01:48.360> if

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
our our record speaks for itself if

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.789 
our our record speaks for itself if
somebody<00:01:48.810> really<00:01:49.140> wants<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:49.469> back<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
somebody really wants to go back and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.279 
somebody really wants to go back and
look<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> stats<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.719> back<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
look at the stats and go back through a
