alright<00:00:01.260> guys<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.650> just<00:00:02.340> made<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> video

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
alright guys so I just made a video

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.980 
alright guys so I just made a video
showing<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.529> guys<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.920> do<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.990> spark

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
showing you guys how to do this spark

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.500 
showing you guys how to do this spark
repair<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.680> your<00:00:08.189> TR<00:00:08.760> x70<00:00:09.150> doesn't<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.450> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
repair if your TR x70 doesn't have a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.770 
repair if your TR x70 doesn't have a
spark<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> volume<00:00:10.320> was<00:00:11.509> zero<00:00:12.509> because<00:00:12.750> I

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
spark but the volume was zero because I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.419 
spark but the volume was zero because I
had<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> full<00:00:13.139> case<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> GoPro<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> have

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
had the full case on the GoPro so I have

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.910 
had the full case on the GoPro so I have
to<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.299> case<00:00:15.570> now<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.049> I'm

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to have it out of the case now so I'm

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.900 
to have it out of the case now so I'm
just<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> show<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.789> pretty

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
just going to show it to you it's pretty

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.349 
just going to show it to you it's pretty
simple<00:00:18.470> basically<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:20.160> these<00:00:20.340> TRX<00:00:20.820> 70s<00:00:21.240> they

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
simple basically with these TRX 70s they

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.349 
simple basically with these TRX 70s they
loose<00:00:21.600> spark<00:00:22.640> quite<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.910> when<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.180> get

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
loose spark quite a bit when they get

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.140 
loose spark quite a bit when they get
old<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.949> what<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.670> contact

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
old and what it is it's a little contact

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.419 
old and what it is it's a little contact
inside<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> gearbox<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.279> see

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
inside the gearbox here and you can see

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
inside the gearbox here and you can see
here<00:00:29.789> where<00:00:29.939> there's<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> neutral<00:00:31.080> switch

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
here where there's a neutral switch

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.659 
here where there's a neutral switch
right<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> if<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.189> switch<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
right here and if you switch it out of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.370 
right here and if you switch it out of
here<00:00:32.790> okay<00:00:33.030> that's<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.200> not

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
here okay that's when you know it's not

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.220 
here okay that's when you know it's not
in<00:00:34.940> neutral<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.809> neutral<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
in neutral so it has to be neutral to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
in neutral so it has to be neutral to
have<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> spark<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> start<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:39.210> real

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
have a spark to start it so it's real

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
have a spark to start it so it's real
simple<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.200> didn't<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> spark

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
simple this one didn't have the spark

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.209 
simple this one didn't have the spark
and<00:00:41.840> all<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> take<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and all you do is just kind of take the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
and all you do is just kind of take the
shifter<00:00:44.640> tie<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> move<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> back<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
shifter tie and you move it back and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.439 
shifter tie and you move it back and
forth<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:49.460> bunch<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> times<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:54.120> helps

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
forth a bunch of times and it helps

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
forth a bunch of times and it helps
where<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> contact<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.250> more

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
where that contact in a little bit more

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.330 
where that contact in a little bit more
on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> inside<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.930> quite<00:00:58.230> easy<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.620> fix

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
on the inside now it's quite easy to fix

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
on the inside now it's quite easy to fix
if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.149> take<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> way

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
if you want to like take it all the way

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
if you want to like take it all the way
off<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.280> take<00:01:02.550> this

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
off and work on it you just take this

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
off and work on it you just take this
clip<00:01:02.969> off<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.600> take<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.470> slide

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
clip off right here take this to slide

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
clip off right here take this to slide
right<00:01:04.739> off<00:01:04.949> take<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> bolts<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.090> take<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
right off take the bolts off take the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
right off take the bolts off take the
cover<00:01:06.659> off<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.490> right<00:01:08.490> next<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.030> there's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
cover off and right next to this there's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.100 
cover off and right next to this there's
a<00:01:09.420> bolt<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.439> holds<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:12.060> sensor<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a bolt that holds in the sensor so you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
a bolt that holds in the sensor so you
just<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> bolt<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.520> eight

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just take that bolt out to eight

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
just take that bolt out to eight
millimeter<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.450> believe<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.650> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
millimeter I believe and then you just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
millimeter I believe and then you just
grab<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> sensor<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.640> pull<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
grab the sensor and pull it out on the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
grab the sensor and pull it out on the
backside<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.409> brass<00:01:19.740> contact

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
backside of it is a little brass contact

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
backside of it is a little brass contact
point<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.270> scuff<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> contact<00:01:22.439> point<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
point just scuff that contact point up a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
point just scuff that contact point up a
little<00:01:23.009> bit<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> scuff<00:01:23.880> pad<00:01:24.119> clean<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
little bit with the scuff pad clean it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
little bit with the scuff pad clean it
off<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> stick<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.430> will

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
off and stick it back in and that will

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
off and stick it back in and that will
that<00:01:27.360> should<00:01:27.540> fix<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> take

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that should fix it if not you can take

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850 
that should fix it if not you can take
the<00:01:29.670> wire<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.990> goes<00:01:31.049> into<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> wiring

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the wire that goes into the wiring

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.850 
the wire that goes into the wiring
harness<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.350> I'm<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.590> sure<00:01:34.740> if

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
harness here up in here I'm not sure if

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
harness here up in here I'm not sure if
you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> wiring

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you can see it but there in the wiring

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.490 
you can see it but there in the wiring
harness<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.159> take<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> white<00:01:39.930> wire

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
harness up in there take the white wire

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
harness up in there take the white wire

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
with the red stripe it it may be faded

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
with the red stripe it it may be faded
and<00:01:43.560> may<00:01:43.770> look<00:01:43.979> yellow<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> red<00:01:44.790> stripe

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and may look yellow with a red stripe

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.389 
and may look yellow with a red stripe
but<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.899> ground<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.409> wire<00:01:46.649> alright

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
but just ground that wire alright

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
but just ground that wire alright
basically<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> contact<00:01:48.810> does<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
basically what this contact does and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
basically what this contact does and
when<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> neutral<00:01:49.770> grounds<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> that's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
when it's the neutral grounds it that's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999 
when it's the neutral grounds it that's
not<00:01:51.000> grounded<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> won't<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> spark<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
not grounded you won't get a spark and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:53.780 
not grounded you won't get a spark and
you'll<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.310> crazy

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you'll go crazy

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
you'll go crazy
changing<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> stator<00:01:54.810> out<00:01:55.079> changing<00:01:56.070> the

changing the stator out changing the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.179 
changing the stator out changing the
coil<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.649> messing<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.009> when

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
coil out and messing with all that when

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.770 
coil out and messing with all that when
you<00:01:59.310> don't<00:01:59.490> need<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you don't need to do that it's it's a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
you don't need to do that it's it's a
simple<00:02:01.110> problem<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:02.189> happens<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.700> time

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
simple problem that happens all the time

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
simple problem that happens all the time
with<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.119> TRX<00:02:03.540> seventies<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.290> two<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
with these TRX seventies I have two of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.100 
with these TRX seventies I have two of
them<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.030> okay<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.659> both<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
them here okay and they both have the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.559 
them here okay and they both have the
same<00:02:07.140> problem<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.729> out<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.119> shift

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
same problem so just get out here shift

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
same problem so just get out here shift
it<00:02:09.720> back<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> forth

it back and forth

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.880 
it back and forth
about<00:02:12.520> good<00:02:13.030> 50<00:02:13.390> times<00:02:13.630> or<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.260> that'll

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
about good 50 times or so and that'll

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.470 
about good 50 times or so and that'll
help<00:02:14.980> wearing<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.550> little<00:02:15.700> bit<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.000> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
help wearing in a little bit and and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.030 
help wearing in a little bit and and
you're<00:02:16.600> good<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> go<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.770> still<00:02:18.010> doesn't

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
you're good to go if that still doesn't

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
you're good to go if that still doesn't
work<00:02:18.280> try<00:02:18.940> grounding<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.540> out<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.170> said

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
work try grounding it out like I said

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620 
work try grounding it out like I said

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
on the side that goes to the crankcase

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.730 
on the side that goes to the crankcase
ground<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.930> wiring<00:02:29.140> harness<00:02:29.560> side

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
ground it on the wiring harness side

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.220 
ground it on the wiring harness side
just<00:02:30.550> put<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> end<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.690> ground<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.140> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
just put a end on it and ground it you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.720 
just put a end on it and ground it you
can<00:02:32.350> put<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.890> bolt<00:02:33.130> here<00:02:33.370> or

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
can put it right to this bolt here or

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430 
can put it right to this bolt here or
that<00:02:33.880> bolt<00:02:34.090> there<00:02:34.360> or<00:02:34.600> whatever<00:02:34.900> one<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.260> want

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that bolt there or whatever one you want

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.380 
that bolt there or whatever one you want
to<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.790> ground<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> out<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.180> then<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.330> have

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
to do ground it out and then you have

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.060 
to do ground it out and then you have
spark<00:02:38.020> if<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.290> spark<00:02:38.590> again<00:02:38.800> then<00:02:38.980> you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
spark if you have spark again then you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.010 
spark if you have spark again then you
know<00:02:39.190> that's<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.490> problem<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.030> you're<00:02:40.810> good

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
know that's the problem and you're good

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.320 
know that's the problem and you're good
the<00:02:41.410> only<00:02:41.530> problem<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.580> issue<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.180> might

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
the only problem of the issue you might

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.030 
the only problem of the issue you might
come<00:02:43.540> into<00:02:43.750> there<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.530> will<00:02:44.650> start<00:02:44.920> in

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
come into there is that it will start in

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.550 
come into there is that it will start in
any<00:02:45.220> gear<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:46.900> makes<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.350> it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
any gear and and this makes it so it

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
any gear and and this makes it so it
starts<00:02:47.800> in<00:02:47.920> neutral<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.490> good<00:02:49.420> luck<00:02:49.570> with<00:02:49.690> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
starts in neutral so good luck with that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.060 
starts in neutral so good luck with that
and<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> other<00:02:51.430> video<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.810> can

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and I have the other video and if I can

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.010 
and I have the other video and if I can
figure<00:02:54.070> out<00:02:54.190> how<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.370> do<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.550> sound<00:02:54.850> bite<00:02:55.750> over

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
figure out how to do a sound bite over

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.680 
figure out how to do a sound bite over
it<00:02:56.670> I'll<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.240> guys<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.600> can

see the whole thing apart but I you know
for<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.690> fix<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.110> really<00:03:02.290> don't<00:03:02.410> need<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
for this fix you really don't need to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.990 
for this fix you really don't need to
take<00:03:02.650> anything<00:03:02.920> apart<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.580> you're<00:03:03.880> not

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
take anything apart if you're not

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.520 
take anything apart if you're not
getting<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.360> spark<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.840> was<00:03:04.959> getting<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.260> spark

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
getting a spark it was getting a spark

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.930 
getting a spark it was getting a spark
and<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.830> sudden<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.130> lost<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.520> do<00:03:06.790> this

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
and all the sudden it lost it do this

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.250 
and all the sudden it lost it do this
first<00:03:07.240> before<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.570> do<00:03:07.660> anything<00:03:07.900> else

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
first before you do anything else

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.220 
first before you do anything else
alright<00:03:08.530> good<00:03:09.190> luck
