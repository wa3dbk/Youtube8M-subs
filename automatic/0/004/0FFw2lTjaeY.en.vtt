are no easy qualifications what made our

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.440 
are no easy qualifications what made our
group<00:00:41.460> perhaps<00:00:41.700> slightly<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.420> difficult

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
group perhaps slightly more difficult

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
group perhaps slightly more difficult
was<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.070> were<00:00:44.190> seeded<00:00:44.610> number

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
was that you know we were seeded number

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.810 
was that you know we were seeded number
two<00:00:45.530> but<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.649> also<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:47.190> ethically<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.640> our

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
two but we also got ethically in our

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.000 
two but we also got ethically in our
group<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.660> font<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.260> course<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.620> taking

part this year albeit they're not trying
to<00:00:52.260> qualify<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.789> were<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.030> team<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.870> got

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to qualify so we were the team that got

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.619 
to qualify so we were the team that got
Italy<00:00:55.620> who<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.280> course<00:00:56.489> also<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.149> second

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
see if you like they'd have been in the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.029 
see if you like they'd have been in the
same<00:00:59.160> group<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> us<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.690> we're<00:01:01.020> only<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.440> 14<00:01:01.920> in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
same group of us so we're only on 14 in

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.030 
same group of us so we're only on 14 in
that<00:01:02.190> respect<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.830> three

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that respect and it's going to be three

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.200 
that respect and it's going to be three
very<00:01:05.400> tough<00:01:05.700> games<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.600> honest<00:01:06.960> we

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
very tough games but to be honest we

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
very tough games but to be honest we
were<00:01:09.210> where<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> draw<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
were where that going to that draw in

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
were where that going to that draw in
florianopolis<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:13.080> were<00:01:13.229> pretty<00:01:13.409> likely

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
florianopolis we were pretty likely

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
florianopolis we were pretty likely
afterwards<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.760> saying<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> tough

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
afterwards to be saying this is a tough

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
afterwards to be saying this is a tough
draw<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.130> easy<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
draw this is not going to be easy it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
draw this is not going to be easy it
will<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.390> very<00:01:18.570> difficult<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:19.170> us<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.560> out

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
will be very difficult for us to get out

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
will be very difficult for us to get out
of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> group<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:21.240> exactly<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
of the group and that's exactly how it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
of the group and that's exactly how it
turned<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.500> me<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> second<00:01:23.640> part<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
turned out to me on the second part of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.280 
turned out to me on the second part of
the<00:01:24.000> question<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.600> playing<00:01:24.930> south

about<00:01:34.650> who<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.100> wanted<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> play<00:01:35.820> before<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
about who we wanted to play before we

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
knew we were even played Uruguay you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.450 
knew we were even played Uruguay you
know<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.329> didn't<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> chance<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.250> leave

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
know we didn't have the chance to leave

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.850 
know we didn't have the chance to leave
it<00:01:41.610> quite<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> late<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it quite that late but one of the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600 
American Asian African opposition very
often<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.649> play<00:01:56.009> an<00:01:56.130> awful<00:01:56.460> lot<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
often but we do play an awful lot of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
often but we do play an awful lot of
games<00:01:57.270> against<00:01:57.630> European<00:01:58.020> team<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.649> for

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
games against European team so for

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.190 
games against European team so for
example<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.610> 25<00:02:00.000> games<00:02:01.009> all<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.430> maybe

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
example in my 25 games all but maybe

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.560 
example in my 25 games all but maybe
three<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.229> four<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:05.340> been<00:02:05.670> against<00:02:06.149> European

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
three or four have been against European

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
three or four have been against European
opposition<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> chance<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.729> get

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
opposition so this was a chance to get

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.170 
opposition so this was a chance to get
the<00:02:09.060> balance<00:02:09.300> right<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.610> also<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.730> course<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the balance right and also of course to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
the balance right and also of course to
play<00:02:12.300> teams<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.959> play<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> little<00:02:13.410> bit

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
play teams that play it a little bit

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.790 
play teams that play it a little bit
me<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.060> hope<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.709> apart<00:02:16.709> from

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
me because we hope that apart from

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.309 
me because we hope that apart from
Uruguay<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.819> do<00:02:18.090> progress<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
Uruguay if we do progress in the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.780 
Uruguay if we do progress in the
tournament<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:19.890> might<00:02:20.099> meet<00:02:20.310> teams<00:02:20.640> from

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
tournament we might meet teams from

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.590 
tournament we might meet teams from
South<00:02:21.120> America<00:02:21.630> Central<00:02:21.810> America<00:02:22.050> again
