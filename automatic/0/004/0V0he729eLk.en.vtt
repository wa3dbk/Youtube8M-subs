00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
cut into a point where I think it could

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
cut into a point where I think it could

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
absolutely annihilated me here in his

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.440

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
so hopefully this time I don't know

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.560 
so hopefully this time I don't know
you'll<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> I've<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you'll see here that I've actually got a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.619 
you'll see here that I've actually got a
mod<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.489> I've<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> few<00:00:51.059> miles<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.449> will

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
mod that I've got a few miles i will

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
mod that I've got a few miles i will
talk<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
talk about but this one here you know it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
talk about but this one here you know it
tells<00:00:54.270> me<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.570> books<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
tells me what books are right on what I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.450 
tells me what books are right on what I
haven't<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.520> actually<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.629> through<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
haven't so I can actually go through and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.590 
haven't so I can actually go through and
you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.969> I've<00:01:00.059> read<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you know I know what I've read now it

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
you know I know what I've read now it
probably<00:01:00.960> won't<00:01:01.590> work<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.309> mods<00:01:02.520> new

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
probably won't work because the mods new

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
probably won't work because the mods new
so<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.000> won't<00:01:03.239> work<00:01:03.420> from<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.589> things<00:01:04.860> in

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
so it won't work from you know things in

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
so it won't work from you know things in
everything<00:01:05.280> I've<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:06.060> skill<00:01:07.049> set<00:01:07.080> has

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
everything I've got my skill set has

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.310 
everything I've got my skill set has
been<00:01:07.799> adapted<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.450> perks<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
been adapted as well so my perks and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.730 
been adapted as well so my perks and
stuff<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:11.060> better<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.080> least<00:01:13.260> they're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
stuff are better or at least they're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
stuff are better or at least they're
more<00:01:14.360> varied<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.110> two

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
more varied so you get like two

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
more varied so you get like two
different<00:01:16.619> types<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.220> bow<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> arrow<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
different types of bow and arrow and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.850 
different types of bow and arrow and
just<00:01:18.540> stuff<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.439> makes<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
just stuff like that that just makes the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
just stuff like that that just makes the
game<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> lot<00:01:20.369> better<00:01:20.580> also<00:01:20.909> got<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.240> blink

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
game a lot better also got this blink

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
game a lot better also got this blink
thing<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.470> portal<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.670> know
