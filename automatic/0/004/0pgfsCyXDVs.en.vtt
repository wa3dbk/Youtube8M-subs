00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.070
 In general, I decided to dub video as 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.200
 I donâ€™t transfer the internet yet 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.059
 I understand that the meaning of the video has already dried up because 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.459
 what is already all the Wi-Fi router 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.050
 but for the sake of tick video decided to overwrite 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.570
 that's where you need this software 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.000
 The first program is sdk manager 2 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.859
 android in program 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.689
 the third program but I will tell no later 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.279
 we go network management center and general 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.439
 access change additional 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.849
 sharing options and here 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.849
 what ticks we insert 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.309
 who can have windows 7 or xp 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.309
 go to change the parameters of the adapter 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.909
 network of internet properties and with it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.769
 there must be a point for us 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.710
 correct same public access well 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.680
 everywhere we set open access well 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:03.890
 I think you understand, yes, I connect the phone 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:08.789
 while we go setting us on then for 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.800
 developers who have developers 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.229
 no we go on the phone and six times 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.149
 click on the build number 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.009
 then go to the developers and set 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.009
 tick in the tab by yusbi 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.179
 go in and sdk manager 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.370
 in general, I am already waiting for it to be updated 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 program but I check the update already 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.730
 set like the first two, and before the file 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.620
 the last but one, that is all we have 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.260
 need the program itself weighs not so 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.880
 few as many as 300 megabytes but still it 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.000
 as you can see we need only three dreams 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 package 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.670
 uncheck in the middle where it is 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.270
 do not need and check google usb 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.790
 driver 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.979
 we need to install the first two packages 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.160
 but all put a tick so click 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.580
 install I have already installed it so 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 me more actually do it and on 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.290
 and so and by the way who did not know google usb 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.410
 driver 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.900
 this is our blender faith all we go in 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.030
 computer properties device manager and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.570
 that's how you see me ascent u300 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.550
 I have now taken the budget Kuna video we 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.000
 Now they have installed experience and drivers, but 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.220
 the process didn't get me any of that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 it became so I am on the Internet 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.870
 found this here is a program that 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.130
 now restore and not after 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.130
 stop I found both drivers and 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.049
 everything worked well just in case 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.530
 aaplet can also throw off such 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.019
 tikhovich like everything will pass but you can 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.870
 try to install but do this 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.720
 operation and without drivers it can you 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.410
 It turns out here about this interface as you 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.590
 you can see 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.370
 hiding device manager we go 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 android tool on the phone push could 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.310
 if you need to go in android 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.900
 against the first line we put refresh well 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.430
 click opposite the second line 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.730
 dramatically push north 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.910
 cherry check this service again 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.980
 click connect on the phone now 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.980
 Visby tunnel application will be installed 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.900
 but the application is being installed 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.900
 automatically using the program 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.570
 open the notification bar line 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.920
 we see that the application has already been installed 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.550
 Internet is not transmitted immediately through 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.640
 some time literally seconds 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.400
 twenty to thirty and starts everything 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.920
 work in the app us nothing 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:22.640
 no need we can get out of it and 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:27.130
 leave it just a background like that 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.660
 internet us already poetry ready go in 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.640
 I'll show you now that I have everything 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.230
 off data I have you crue 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.390
 live or me off 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.690
 sat down as we go on the computer Internet 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.530
 already started to give in let's go as 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.530
 let's say chrome 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.479
 close all tabs for cleanliness 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.750
 window and let's go for example Yandex 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.580
 we will break pictures on a desktop well 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.580
 first thing that came to mind 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.160
 I apologize if the video will be on the phone 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.080
 I have to slow down a bit now 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.710
 phone on my repair so how am i 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.390
 already said on the video I took the budget by 2 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.390
 types of open buy a picture 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.790
 now we scroll open let's say 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.790
 first picture 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.770
 In principle, the Internet can work 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.270
 I think still go to the market 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.270
 see how things are going there 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.340
 here is stamps, too, goes pension all all 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.950
 it works stably and quickly 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:19.590
 okay, I chose the easiest 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.460
 the way it is done literally as you can see 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.500
 two three minutes but because of their misfortune 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.500
 the video will be a little longer 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.040
 and so on everything and I think all of you all 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.170
 understandably 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.970
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.970
