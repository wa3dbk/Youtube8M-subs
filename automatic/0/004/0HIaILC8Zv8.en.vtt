00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 a day June 5, 1982 melipilla 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 I screamed to the world that I had a champion 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 world that son of this earth that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 reached the always elusive glory was 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.469
 Benedict Villa Blanca a little less than 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.299
 three weeks he got to enjoy the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.039
 boxer melipillano the lightweight crown 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.810
 junior of the aemet 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 about how the combat had been 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.300
 Benedict Villa Blanca pointed out that it was 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.699
 a tough fight with samuel serrano was 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 pretty hard the fight remembering 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.430
 always said that it seemed outside and that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.820
 see this world cup and as I say it was a 5 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.890
 June that was also very rainy 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 many people went out to the street and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:46.190
 we remember that that evening you 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.620
 a nice outcome for me for the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.690
 for whole chile where people had their 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.909
 first the champion of the world and already white 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.649
 recalls the days before the fight in 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.539
 where there was a lot of nervousness because 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.320
 it was hard to maintain the weight 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.430
 good the previous days pretty 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.589
 nervousness because one has to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.689
 keep a weight which costs me 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.289
 pretty do that league category no 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.090
 there's union 58 kilos 800 grams of that 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.070
 same the previous day of reality I 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.450
 was based on a kilo and had to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.710
 go down the same day in the path of that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.080
 kilo which reduces a little my physique my 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.640
 physical abilities so I had to 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.580
 achieve weight loss the morning that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.959
 to remain without eating all day arrive the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.729
 moment of the morning of the fish to which 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.280
 dallas well the morning and just there you 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.569
 you can feed yourself with something light and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.350
 wait for the night when the time arrives 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.350
 to fight that title 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.080
 that day already in the gym as it was those 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.510
 previous moments the fight also that 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.390
 remember good yes 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.640
 always one has an uncertain space and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.590
 the asparagus ri that maxwell a 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 Panamanian lost with the space in which 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.110
 was the serrano and the tan because he was 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.970
 modelito lost the fight lost the fight 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.360
 with the sparring of the then came to 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.250
 my side said sorry I told me about 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.350
 fraud told me do not worry the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.700
 balance that was in flesh it's my turn 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.110
 now and there it came out that we went to the ring in 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.940
 which the national song all the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.580
 rhythms that are made to face a 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.450
 world title in which I 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.880
 I found enough with enough 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.710
 possibility you want to be champion of 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.200
 world had a lot of desire to win 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.320
 global successes for the family 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.320
 for chile was going to peace for everyone so 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.700
 I came up with the confidence that I could 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.220
 achieve it 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.620
 the reader operates bigger was more more 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 corpulent but my my quality 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.700
 prepared 100% to look like this so 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.440
 he cut me with a lot of faith and even green 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.140
 a very big emotion was the one that felt 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.210
 at the time he was declared the winner 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.670
 good if a very big emotion even 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.240
 I kneel on the floor with my promoter 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.490
 the people were very happy with me 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.940
 still not assimilating what what was 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.620
 really what we had achieved 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.690
 we had achieved so it was like having 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.670
 won a world title but did not 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.740
 I took the weight a lot later with the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.290
 time I was taking the weight and really 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.570
 it was nothing was something important has been 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.690
 won to chile after they came by 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.370
 minors after 19 days they say that I 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.830
 they have helped worldwide but that's not 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.690
 depends on me depended on the water of the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.330
 people and driven to the fields of 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.330
 worldwide so I personally personally 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.160
 I feel champion of the world what are the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.010
 reasons that give you at that time it seems 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.750
 that the fight that won the one that was not worth your 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.810
 triumph even though it had already been 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.300
 raised the champion belt good 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.670
 yes look there is there within the program 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.400
 comes from outside of states 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.829
 United 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.230
 the promoter of us in the veedores of 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.230
 the world association that comes to 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.530
 certify the two world fields were 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.599
 all foreigners and thank god they 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.900
 they raised my hand they put me on 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:15.790
 belt and I came out world champion but 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.079
 after 19 days it is said that they had 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.109
 removed the title to merit and great heat 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.539
 that adds a headbutt which does not 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.280
 there was then to have the video of him but 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.650
 there were never cases of this one hit one 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.710
 right hand that broke his eyebrow 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.710
 eyebrows at the rival and then they came 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.090
 later said was made me laugh because 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.889
 I want to blame the president 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.380
 my night that because of him he has 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.030
 removed the shot after the champion 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.910
 would not be paid the money that came to 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.490
 that you have offered many versions 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.849
 many versions because what really 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.740
 it happened that after a week we went 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.830
 to puerto rico to defend yourself and world that 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.020
 they have already said that they have taken 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.940
 which my rivals took a 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.310
 videocassette where the fight 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.560
 complete but I half is where I already 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.810
 it suited them then us as 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.670
 coach and gave the subject now we arrived 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.620
 with our video and I called him in hand 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.390
 and I told the president of the fields 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.550
 from the world cup of Luis Batista Sala I told him 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.430
 look sir here is the video see you 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.620
 the video does not tell me anymore no good not like that 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.210
 you have seen it because you did not see 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.880
 when the referee raised his hand 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.670
 the seller put the belt on me and I 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.800
 I was world champion and I kept looking 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.770
 I'm going to see her eyes she told me and she sees the 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.630
 complete fight gone at the complete time and 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.040
 he says walking his eyes tells me 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.310
 face to face once a day Sunday 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.800
 he still tells me white vision so I 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.330
 I see you are world champion but 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.520
 you will notice and I am the mayor 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.440
 your risk and I'm postulating 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.060
 governor I can no longer make a ruling 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.620
 another failure back 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.670
 so the champion Rodriguez and everything that 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.780
 I can give you an opportunity that has 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.780
 brought world nothing
