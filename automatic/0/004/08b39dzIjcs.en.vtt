00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.100
 the guys all good welcome to home 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.639
 of the collector and in today's program 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.099
 We'll be dealing with you at 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.410
 where to buy comic books 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.440
 some people came memoral doing 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.119
 This question is of course personal 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.570
 the first the first option are the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 benches, if you live in a city 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.820
 median above 150 thousand inhabitants you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.550
 will find good things in the stands 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 now if you already live in a smaller city 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.230
 than it is likely that you have a 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.170
 little difficulty 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 then you will need to use the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 internet that same internet 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.930
 first of all I would like to make a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.219
 differentiation if you follow the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.340
 posts 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 the best thing is you find on the bench 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.559
 or directly on the publishers website 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 that's a lot of people sometimes coming 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.210
 the band likes the batman magazine 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.460
 spider man is watching on the internet ask 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 if I had a price on the internet 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.350
 Compensate their publishers 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.110
 have the panini store just type in google 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.259
 shop panini or the public hqm visitor nec 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.020
 and the walking dead that the universe of 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.670
 area before you type in google store h 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.650
 m right because then the best way to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.439
 would you buy the messages for oil from 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.930
 history because usually the last 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.740
 place to exhaust understood always goes 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.939
 be available to it now if you like 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.090
 of specials in khar of I do not 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.820
 I advise you to find them on the docks 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 like shopping malls because they are 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.500
 most of the great sites of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 internet the great sites of purchase 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.360
 What are they, the submarine? 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:06.210
 americanas.com cold extra fnac hail 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 Bookstore Culture then understood the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.010
 incarnate you must give is you should 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.599
 look before these big 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.709
 of account now if you are in search of 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.000
 comics more or less rare sold out 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.730
 You did not find any of the great 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.489
 mainly hail shopping sites and 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.239
 culture and you also did not find the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.769
 The new stores in the store 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.500
 of the aqmi 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.980
 so you should go to the comic shops 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.560
 In the comic shops, I recommend you. 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 and the store is not connected to hq 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 I recommend the way house and house 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.440
 in the northeast is in progress who lives and 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.260
 Northeast is easier to ask for the comic 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 house or ah ah ah ah ate that is from 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.810
 how did I remember it? 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.420
 like that of meadows that is a new and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.230
 has facebook page reminding you that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.680
 all these all like shopping malls 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.319

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.840

 find the store connects hq the league is 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:39.099

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.959
 another older one shows how the mall 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.340
 personal comics lately to commodities 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.829
 It's taking time to make the billing 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.069
 and delivery that is the main one 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.790
 her complaint on the internet 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.209

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.690
