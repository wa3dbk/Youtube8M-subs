00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.139
 blind in a cie 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.139
 lara that one works for that pd tries to 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.920
 when I ccoo out there things is not do not come out as one does not intend to follow 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:18.989
 working 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.989
 maybe last semester 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.720
 it was not good it's a reality 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.929
 you have to accept by cities is when things 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.470
 no and they do not come out as one one pretends 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.030
 but hey we know that this is football and can change order 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.250
 p 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 I think what was important was in my case 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.210
 percent and I think I say it always perform one to a good preseason 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.580
 thing that is not 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.760
 for time issues I do not know you can not do it in the last semester if 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 in a moment 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.570
 percent in the team they were 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.280
 in competition 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 I came from another semester a mouth not a very good one 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.140
 not very good in the sense that I can not have the continuity air I think 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.000
 that one 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.630
 always pretend 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.740
 so whoever is in this present the things have changed thank god I think 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.470
 what 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.720
 that one always 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 keeps the faith that the most important thing 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 and with humility and with work I think that there is no other secret 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.350
 things for a hundred 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.390
 they do not find otherwise 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.660
 with another expectation perpectivas and that it was true that I am very happy yes 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.440
 I think we have found 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.400
 maturity forcefulness ee 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 know how to handle the matches also I think that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.320
 when 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.100
 Ue does not lose or is that a defeat 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.170
 the important thing is to know how to live with that to day and learn 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.270
 it's a lesson so 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.530
 that I think we were able to 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.840
 to assimilate it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.230
 in the best way 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.420
 he knows that things have to be corrected 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.750
 percent and I think we found in these wins 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.160
 by a hundred a lot of confidence by the way to what she does the truth yes 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.519
 it's exciting that he put it that we received from him 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.399
 of people for a moment I think when things sometimes 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.919
 not 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.479
 they do not work the support of the people always was always 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.579
 I hope that we can always on the field reward him 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.189
 ps sweetheart percent being raised fuel oil 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.669
 percent is good results if the candidate does not they are what what 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:37.129
 we all want
