has included this is a bundle so without

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.270 
has included this is a bundle so without
the<00:00:33.780> footer<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.230> let's<00:00:34.469> jump<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.770> into<00:00:35.070> the

the footer do let's jump right into the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.869 
the footer do let's jump right into the
unboxing<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.530> looks<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:40.879> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
unboxing this is how it looks like and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170 
unboxing this is how it looks like and
you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.420> see<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.980> take<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> right

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you can see that here so take it right

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.590 
you can see that here so take it right
out<00:00:45.620> there<00:00:46.620> close<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.390> light

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
out there close to it and this light

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.040 
out there close to it and this light
this<00:00:48.780> light<00:00:49.079> box<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:51.690> AC

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
this light box and you can see an AC

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.910 
this light box and you can see an AC
adapters<00:00:53.270> converters<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
adapters converters you can take it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209 
adapters converters you can take it
overseas<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> national<00:00:57.770> variability<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
overseas like a national variability and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.170 
overseas like a national variability and
this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> an<00:01:00.210> actual<00:01:00.890> AC<00:01:01.890> adapter<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
this is an actual AC adapter and then it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
this is an actual AC adapter and then it
shows<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.470> assemble<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:05.100> together

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
shows how you can assemble them together

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.500 
shows how you can assemble them together
this<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> USB<00:01:07.950> output

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
this is what it is is that USB output

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
this is what it is is that USB output
card<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.250> another<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.150> I'll

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
card right here and another one so I'll

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.710 
card right here and another one so I'll
say<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> mostly<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.500> HF<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:15.210> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
say this is mostly for HF and these this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.399 
say this is mostly for HF and these this
one<00:01:16.100> goes<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> American<00:01:18.119> 110<00:01:18.930> voltage

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
one goes with the American 110 voltage

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
one goes with the American 110 voltage
and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> euros<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and this is for the euros so that you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
and this is for the euros so that you
can<00:01:22.259> use<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.920> I'll<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> aside<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
can use and I'll put this aside and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.499 
can use and I'll put this aside and
let's<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> watch<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.360> can

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
let's go to the watch here and you can

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.600 
let's go to the watch here and you can
remove<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.990> plastic<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:30.890> two<00:01:31.890> flaps<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
remove this plastic and two flaps on the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.590 
remove this plastic and two flaps on the
side<00:01:33.530> take<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.240> how<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
side take that out and this is how the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440 
side take that out and this is how the
watch<00:01:36.930> looks<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.939> an<00:01:39.119> easy

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
watch looks like it's not really an easy

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260 
watch looks like it's not really an easy
task<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.520> because

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
task to get this out of the way because

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.350 
task to get this out of the way because
it's<00:01:42.750> rubberized<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.759> I'll<00:01:44.850> take<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.060> out

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it's rubberized so I'll take that out

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.279 
it's rubberized so I'll take that out
remove<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.049> styrofoam<00:01:46.290> here

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.800 

and<00:01:52.289> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.249> watch<00:01:53.729> looks<00:01:54.569> like

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
and this is how the watch looks like

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.599 
and this is how the watch looks like
pretty<00:01:57.810> big<00:01:58.259> I'll<00:01:58.439> say<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.100> weights<00:01:59.460> about

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
pretty big I'll say it weights about

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.510 
pretty big I'll say it weights about
three<00:02:00.119> point<00:02:00.420> two<00:02:00.659> ounces<00:02:01.280> according<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.429> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
three point two ounces according to the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
three point two ounces according to the
Garmin<00:02:02.850> website<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.539> I'll<00:02:03.689> put<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.170> for

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
Garmin website so I'll put it here for

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.419 
Garmin website so I'll put it here for
now<00:02:04.850> until<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.090> covered<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.479> rest<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:08.099> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
now until well covered the rest and you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.759 
now until well covered the rest and you
get<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> USB<00:02:09.149> charging<00:02:09.780> cable<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.739> goes

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
get the USB charging cable that goes

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.570 
get the USB charging cable that goes
with<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.220> AC<00:02:11.400> adapter<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.239> saw<00:02:12.450> earlier

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
with the AC adapter which I saw earlier

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.610 
with the AC adapter which I saw earlier
and<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.060> fabric<00:02:15.330> mr.<00:02:15.959> shrapp<00:02:16.319> if<00:02:16.530> you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and you get the fabric mr. shrapp if you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.559 
and you get the fabric mr. shrapp if you
don't<00:02:16.799> like<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.190> rubber<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.510> on

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
don't like this rubber one you can go on
