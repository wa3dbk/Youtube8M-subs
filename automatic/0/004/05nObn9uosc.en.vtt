these four yes anything the fact that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.090

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
think is a little different from what we

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.960 
think is a little different from what we
usually<00:03:33.540> had<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> high<00:03:34.950> grade<00:03:35.340> are<00:03:35.609> except

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
usually had for a high grade are except

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.599 
usually had for a high grade are except
here<00:03:36.120> -<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.739> his<00:03:37.739> home<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.340> two<00:03:39.150> pieces<00:03:39.540> so

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
here - to his home is in two pieces so

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.449 
here - to his home is in two pieces so
nothing<00:03:41.609> special<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.660> Vulcans<00:03:43.230> here<00:03:43.739> I'm
