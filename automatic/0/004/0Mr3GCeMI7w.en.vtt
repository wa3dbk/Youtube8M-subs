00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 well we are in minecraft 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.880
 wait a little while here is a tad 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.160
 harder it's worth in 1.7 point 10 we're going to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.309
 see a mod a mod that we already saw one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.599
 seemed a while ago is it is different 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 I had some little things that I liked the most 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.260
 quite 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.250
 the question is that I'm going blocks 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 blocks that can regain life 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.550
 I do not know very well how to say it but they are 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.390
 very bad and breaking them may be 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 transform into an attack mode there 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.880
 some who then we 'll see we're going 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.570
 seeing them we have the stone 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.970
 the logical thing with the eyes is easy is 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.580
 stone simply a space outside 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.770
 I'm speaking before the iron this 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.040
 have 10 days of life they do not have 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 little eyes are super aggressive only bonuses 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.410
 there are all all going to try to kill us 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.680
 like an explosion when you kill sound the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.680
 of coal I love the eyes god 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.940
 this with one diamond out 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.060
 lapis lazuli 12 this christmas 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.530
 dies and as you see gives us this has 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.090
 given the gold there are times that you can 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.070
 give and others that do not now send or iron 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.620
 the iron does not know if the carbon is 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.430
 lola if they have not given us before 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.940
 none but well we have the gold this one 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.940
 has more life 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.020
 nothing will be released 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.910
 now the good thing is that it does not give us the gold 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.180
 already burned that we are going to see also the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.620
 from reston this has 15 life 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.060
 even so we continue to kill the 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.680
 blows with this diamond this now 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.480
 yes we have the rest and we are going 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.479
 to see the last two aggressive that is 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.430
 the diamond that is 18 is more 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.430
 complicated here 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.510
 in those two diamonds md one was the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 of the quartz of the level that this one attacks 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.439
 but this attack from a distance 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.099
 you can shoot and the eyes look 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.099
 the eyes like the 90 consur 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.390
 today 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 it will not kill me 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.049
 thank goodness I 've put fast in 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.750
 creative but if I'm very much at 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:30.400
 shoot dies the posts fourth is me 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.400
 estimating not 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.659
 but these bugs come out by breaking their 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.010
 blocks if we break quartz can leave 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.650
 the quartz for example this kind of 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.959
 things and then 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.299
 we have a p is a classic table if 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.069
 we click right like this directly and 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.230
 It used to be a bit weird 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.220
 that follows me there is no problem because 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.170
 before I get the impression that I do not 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.090
 followed 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.920
 I'm supposed to be just by 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.069
 breaking casting tables in the villages and 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.069
 that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.690
 and now it happens to me I still assured the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.350
 man is useful to go trasteando what 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.040
 want 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.040
 wharton voltor 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.140
 like the one that I think does not do anything 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.140
 I think we are going against the enemies 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.130
 it definitely does not do anything 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.290
 is running away from my casting table is 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.760
 a potato and then we have in the tnt 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.430
 what am I suppose will be in the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.840
 in temples that these desert 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.760
 you can find tnt because if I do not I do not know 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.640
 where are you going to take it out because I want to see it 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.099
 maybe if we put the TNT 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.500
 but we have to be super pet with the 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.790
 little eyes here that you monkeys and this is supposed 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.790
 that attack the bugs 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 m 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.100
 what a brute you really are apart 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.390
 let's move away in olancho year 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.390
 he has not made the marriage 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.209
 where are you from but you had the other one 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.209
 close but 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.820
 they look like remote-controlled bombs 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.820
 and av 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.770
 I'm quite going but it does not seem like it 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.450
 do a lot of damage to better because I'm in 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.220
 the snow I too 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.140
 that looks like this from the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.760
 Snow is better for me, crafting table 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.380
 it is necessary to say it because it is that this one 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.540
 immolate 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.190
 So if he immolates himself, we lose him. 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.190
 cool year 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.200
 OK 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.570
 we have the dumbest three in the world 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.770
 because I think if they kill each other 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.229
 does not appear 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.740
 this mascot is not very useful 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.750
 the truth 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.800
 that they are killed among them is a 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.560
 already contribute to the people how cool it is but 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.669
 the crafting tables and how to have side 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.250
 the petras dye and because it seems 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.199
 quite useful but good you have the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.389
 description of this button chorra put 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.750
 of latent had not tried to put more 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.990
 of one and they kill each other and in 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.990
 against 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.400
 come on you can do it 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.860
 I want is that there is nothing there 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.780
 when it's hard for you to turn around 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.780
 Conversion arrival thematic penalty 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:47.870
 Spain this is silly but good 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.800
 since the registration is now 1.7 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.229
 point 10 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.870
 Wait for me to put this thing that has been 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.810
 forgotten that it is the seed because 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.960
 we have a biome of these rare but os 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.960
 I liked it 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.210
 bye
