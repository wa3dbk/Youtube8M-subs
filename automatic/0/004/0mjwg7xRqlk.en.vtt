00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.599
 michael pleases me nobody 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.199
 this year the philharmonic party 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.650
 this activity will have great editing and symphonic music this is the eighth 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.649
 gustav mahler symphony 7 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 and what constitutes the cultural event of the year 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.900
 the eighth symphony 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.200
 the councilor of pp 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.630
 as a cultural event casyc 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.930
 carrier of the year 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.420
 so it means 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.820
 a symphony 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.610
 that many consider that it is not 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.760
 However 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.720
 is conceived from the musical point of view 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 like a chair 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.790
 symphony 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.539
 since it has the conventional movements of a symphony 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.660
 but there is more 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 cural part extraordinary environment temperature rohr car this is a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 draft 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.649
 that for the first time is going to be done in Colombia 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.000
 this comes haroun mir 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.940
 obviously many 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.610
 d the artists of colombia 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 and also international to do 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 a truth of the most important works in the repertoires 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 and that is rarely celebrated 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.690
 He remembered that evidently being the protagonist because he is the only one 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.820
 symphony 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.620
 totally choral that was written the history of music so far 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880
 roo 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.329
 the soloists are protagonists the children's choir has moments 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.430
 protagonists and the orchestra too 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.730
 when these women at the time it is extremely difficult to know who has the 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.250
 via 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.550
 because very complex what happens 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.520
 8 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.120
 p 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.370
 the difficulty that the director is 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.260
 assemble all this 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
 here to get this not to come back 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.279
 that the trees do not let the forest see that what usually happens with a 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.539
 work so difficult 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.499
 in the case that this philharmonic of Bogota will have the presence of 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.839
 400 musicians that are made up of the 97 musicians that are part of the 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.839
 philharmonic orchestra of bogota the promoting entity of this event 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.889
 forty musicians from the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia and 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.180
 We are also going to count on the participation among several counties of 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.209
 the city 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.260
 We were to count on participation p 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.989
 you are international 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.529
 For Ana 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.569
 it was something many countries managed 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.489
 they should do it with their own strengths and I understand that this is 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.560
 the first time 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.289
 what is going to be done in colombia 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:03.709
 that I have never participated in a wind and previous attempt four or five ago 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.419
 years we barely managed to work five or six months 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.799
 but on the floor there were reasons that 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.180
 and I understand that before 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.069
 other attempts too 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.649
 so that this the culmination of those three or four previous attempts 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.299
 and very important 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.339
 this park the councilman 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.989
 I had to go yesterday 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 by the way I do not understand very different 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.579
 to be at the height 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.979
 the play 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.329
 weird 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.969
 dt sergio markarián 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.159
 in two meetings 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.299
 the inept people 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.739
 all enough 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.010
 to play it the eighth symphony is a first waste of musical power 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.669
 and of musical imagination it takes a lot of money because the orchestra 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.779
 undoubtedly will have to be reinforced then the choir 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.489
 what is a chorus m 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.099
 of children choir mixed choir of women these will have to gather the best 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.149
 choirs of colombia 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.709
 we must soloists 8 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.979
 other artists and it has to be top the norm alvarito irak is a culmination 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.479
 of all the path so respectable and also sevilla 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.009
 of the signature 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.210
 the eighth symphony is also called 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.979
 the symphony of the thousand 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.979
 because when it premiered 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.939
 With the presence 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.469
