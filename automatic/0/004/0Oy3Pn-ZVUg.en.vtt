00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
pole dancing one was one just because I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.090 
pole dancing one was one just because I
was<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.640> part<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.600> why<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.920> was

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.200 
and the model was really professional
and<00:01:49.810> easy<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.440> work<00:01:50.590> with<00:01:50.650> so<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.700> was<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:51.970> hard

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
and easy to work with so it was a hard

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.060 
and easy to work with so it was a hard
challenge<00:01:52.510> but<00:01:52.840> it's<00:01:52.960> sort<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.170> easy<00:01:53.440> in<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.950> way

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
challenge but it's sort of easy in a way

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.130 
challenge but it's sort of easy in a way
as<00:01:54.250> well<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.729> couple<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.690> things<00:01:55.869> come<00:01:56.049> out

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
as well a couple of the things come out

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.420 
as well a couple of the things come out
of<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:56.530> they<00:01:56.650> were<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.920> last<00:01:57.100> two

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
of that so they were the last two

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.340 
of that so they were the last two
challenges<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.119> actually<00:01:58.479> we<00:01:58.630> built<00:01:59.020> up<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
challenges so actually we built up the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.020 
challenges so actually we built up the
challenges<00:01:59.770> in<00:01:59.890> terms<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.280> skills<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:00.909> they

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
challenges in terms of skills and they

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.789 
challenges in terms of skills and they
were<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.479> think<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.869> hardest<00:02:02.440> ones<00:02:02.680> in

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
were I think the hardest ones in

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.310 
were I think the hardest ones in
definitely<00:02:03.400> trying<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.940> shoot<00:02:04.240> but<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.229> they

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
definitely trying to shoot but and they

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.960 
definitely trying to shoot but and they
were<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> two<00:02:05.649> that<00:02:05.830> arguably<00:02:06.340> yielded<00:02:06.790> some

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
were the two that arguably yielded some

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.430 
were the two that arguably yielded some
of<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.119> best<00:02:07.300> results<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:07.930> I'll<00:02:08.140> pick<00:02:08.410> two

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
of the best results so I'll pick two

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.979 
of the best results so I'll pick two
that<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:08.860> think<00:02:08.950> were<00:02:09.310> earlier<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:10.929> a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
that I think were earlier on and for a

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.260 
that I think were earlier on and for a
different<00:02:11.319> kind<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.770> mean<00:02:11.980> reason<00:02:12.640> probably

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
different kind of mean reason probably

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.930 
different kind of mean reason probably
the<00:02:13.750> macro<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.560> street<00:02:14.860> because<00:02:15.700> my

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
the macro and the street because my

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.360 
the macro and the street because my
strongest<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.840> either<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.200> them<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:18.069> really

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
strongest the either of them you really

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.340 
strongest the either of them you really
loves<00:02:18.760> neither<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.390> them<00:02:19.540> are<00:02:19.660> your<00:02:19.900> passion

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
loves neither of them are your passion

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.259 
loves neither of them are your passion
but<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.620> does<00:02:20.800> show<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.459> applying<00:02:22.120> those

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
but it does show that applying those

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.520 
but it does show that applying those
same<00:02:22.570> skills<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:22.989> you've<00:02:23.140> been<00:02:23.260> learning

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
same skills that you've been learning

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.810 
same skills that you've been learning
along<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.739> way<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.250> still<00:02:24.459> get<00:02:24.670> good

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
along the way you can still get good

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.640 
along the way you can still get good
shots<00:02:24.880> yeah<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.050> your<00:02:26.200> passion

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
shots yeah so if it's not your passion
