means<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.310> faster<00:00:21.029> PDF<00:00:21.510> feature

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
means for you is a faster PDF feature

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
means for you is a faster PDF feature
some<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.560> those<00:00:22.769> larger<00:00:23.189> PDF<00:00:23.519> files<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.029> may

some of those larger PDF files that may

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
some of those larger PDF files that may
have<00:00:24.300> slowed<00:00:24.539> down<00:00:24.720> your<00:00:24.930> program<00:00:25.320> should

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
have slowed down your program should

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.660 
have slowed down your program should
operate<00:00:26.189> much<00:00:26.550> faster<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:28.460> there<00:00:29.460> should<00:00:29.640> be

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
operate much faster now there should be

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.790 
operate much faster now there should be
significantly<00:00:30.359> less<00:00:30.570> lag<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.410> moving

using our PDF feature the second thing
that<00:00:36.780> we've<00:00:36.989> added<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> mix<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that we've added to the mix is the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.080 
that we've added to the mix is the
ability<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.820> rotate<00:00:39.059> our<00:00:39.629> PDF<00:00:40.440> files<00:00:40.850> by<00:00:41.850> right

clicking on the PDF itself you can

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180 
clicking on the PDF itself you can
change<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.579> rotate<00:00:45.390> angle<00:00:45.770> if<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:47.129> to

spin this 90 degrees 180 degrees or 270
degrees<00:00:53.039> around<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:55.170> optimize

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

perhaps<00:00:58.949> best<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.649> right<00:01:01.649> soft

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
perhaps best of all is this right soft

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.690 
perhaps best of all is this right soft
has<00:01:02.070> add<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> ability<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.270> pan<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.690> PDF<00:01:04.350> file

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
has add the ability to pan the PDF file

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
has add the ability to pan the PDF file
this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> crucial<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.540> being<00:01:07.049> able<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> line
