the<00:01:47.270> vibe<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.750> song<00:01:47.930> but<00:01:48.680> when<00:01:48.799> you're

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920

like those those styles of music or a

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.139 
like those those styles of music or a
combination<00:01:59.360> what<00:02:00.320> really<00:02:00.799> helps<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.579> if<00:02:01.880> we

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
combination what really helps is if we

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.700 
combination what really helps is if we
hit<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.570> strings<00:02:02.930> nice<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.829> hard<00:02:04.070> okay<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.200> we

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
hit the strings nice and hard okay so we

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.109 
hit the strings nice and hard okay so we
can<00:02:06.859> change<00:02:07.100> something<00:02:07.369> like<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.700> I'm<00:02:07.909> just

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
through all six strings now I can make

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.090 
through all six strings now I can make
something<00:02:26.280> transform<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:31.100> into

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
something transform from this into

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:44.600 
something transform from this into
something<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:42.740> okay<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.459> I'm

quite<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> thick<00:02:50.670> pic<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> one<00:02:51.959> millimeter

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
quite a thick pic get a one millimeter

quite a thick pic get a one millimeter
thick<00:02:52.590> pic<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:54.510> am<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.709> for<00:02:56.010> it

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
thick pic and I am just going for it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.490 
thick pic and I am just going for it
like<00:02:56.250> each<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.239> those<00:02:57.330> strings<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.110> really

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
like each one of those strings is really

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.710 
like each one of those strings is really
connecting<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.280> pick<00:02:59.550> and<00:03:00.360> what<00:03:00.540> this

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
connecting with that pick and what this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.010 
connecting with that pick and what this
comes<00:03:01.050> from<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.640> we<00:03:02.640> want<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.940> make<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.450> body

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
comes from is we want to make this body

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.140 
comes from is we want to make this body
of<00:03:04.260> wood<00:03:04.560> whether<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.310> an<00:03:05.400> acoustic<00:03:06.120> guitar

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
of wood whether it be an acoustic guitar

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.260 
of wood whether it be an acoustic guitar
or<00:03:06.660> an<00:03:06.780> electric<00:03:07.170> guitar<00:03:07.730> resonate<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:08.910> much

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
or an electric guitar resonate as much

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.560 
or an electric guitar resonate as much
as<00:03:09.450> possible<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.580> if<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:12.060> plow<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
as possible and if we plow to the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.850 
as possible and if we plow to the
strings<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.020> get<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.350> whole<00:03:13.590> thing

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
strings we get this whole thing

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.770 
strings we get this whole thing
vibrating<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.790> ends<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.090> coming<00:03:15.300> out<00:03:15.510> here

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
vibrating and it ends up coming out here

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.040 
vibrating and it ends up coming out here
to<00:03:15.930> sound<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.350> really<00:03:16.770> big<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.340> full<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.050> I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
to sound a really big and full and I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.350 
to sound a really big and full and I
mean<00:03:19.500> certainly<00:03:19.920> there's<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.250> maximum<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
mean certainly there's a maximum you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.970 
mean certainly there's a maximum you
know<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.989> will<00:03:22.170> be<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.350> maximum<00:03:22.590> where

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
know there will be a maximum where

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.260 
know there will be a maximum where
you're<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.340> kind<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.580> hitting<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> string

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
you're just kind of hitting the string

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.699 
you're just kind of hitting the string
so<00:03:24.480> hard<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.900> they're<00:03:25.020> just<00:03:25.140> flying<00:03:25.440> out<00:03:25.650> of

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
so hard that they're just flying out of

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.320 
so hard that they're just flying out of
tune<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.400> really<00:03:26.670> sounding<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.150> good

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
tune and not really sounding that good

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.800 
tune and not really sounding that good
but<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:29.100> plow<00:03:29.430> through<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.850> string<00:03:30.120> nice

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
but if you plow through the string nice

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.140 
but if you plow through the string nice
and<00:03:31.080> solid<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:32.010> everything<00:03:32.640> will<00:03:32.940> stay

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and solid like that everything will stay

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.360 
and solid like that everything will stay
nice<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.930> tune<00:03:34.440> with<00:03:34.769> your<00:03:34.830> with<00:03:35.250> your

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
nice and in tune with your with your

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
nice and in tune with your with your
hard<00:03:35.640> strums<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.390> end<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.049> sounding<00:03:37.320> really

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
hard strums and end up sounding really

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.039 
hard strums and end up sounding really
nice<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.820> what<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.090> all<00:03:39.269> about<00:03:39.299> here<00:03:39.750> is
