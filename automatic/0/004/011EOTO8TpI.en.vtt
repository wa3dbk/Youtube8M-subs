00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
so that's what it looks very easy just

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:20.740 
so that's what it looks very easy just
have<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.780> have<00:01:09.910> one<00:01:12.370> type<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:17.680> curler<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:19.750> very

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
have to have one type of curler a very

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.180 
have to have one type of curler a very
any<00:01:21.170> color<00:01:21.470> looks<00:01:22.370> like<00:01:22.550> this<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.920> cone

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190

air<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.390> very<00:01:26.690> old<00:01:26.990> okay<00:01:27.470> like<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:28.040> think

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
air this is very old okay like I think

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.890 
air this is very old okay like I think
this<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.480> year<00:01:30.430> old<00:01:32.650> boom<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.810> me<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.290> I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
this is a year old boom to me and I

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.040 
this is a year old boom to me and I
haven't<00:01:38.900> used<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.010> for<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.370> long<00:01:40.790> time

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
haven't used this for a long time

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.310 
haven't used this for a long time
because<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.170> hated<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.770> before<00:01:43.900> because<00:01:44.900> I

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
because I hated it before because I

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.070 
because I hated it before because I
don't<00:01:45.770> know<00:01:45.830> how<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.100> work<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.760> out<00:01:46.850> yet<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.570> I
