00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.199 
working on you know the artistry I'm
performing<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.580> all<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.000> I've<00:02:19.090> been

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
performing and all that and I've been

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.759 
performing and all that and I've been
trying<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.600> learn<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> technique<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.410> singing

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
trying to learn the technique of singing

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.500 
trying to learn the technique of singing
you<00:02:21.040> know<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> right<00:02:21.489> way<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.000> placing<00:02:22.480> your

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
you know the right way and placing your

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.059 
you know the right way and placing your
voice<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.019> think<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.260> hardest<00:02:23.560> part<00:02:23.799> is

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
voice and I think the hardest part is

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.940 
voice and I think the hardest part is
when<00:02:24.819> we<00:02:25.090> go<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.450> actually<00:02:25.930> do<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.350> part<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
when we go to actually do the part and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.520 
when we go to actually do the part and
get<00:02:27.220> into<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.610> character<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.209> dance<00:02:28.530> still

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
get into the character and dance still

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.680 
get into the character and dance still
kind<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.920> keeping<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.819> technique<00:02:31.269> that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
kind of keeping that technique that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.800 
kind of keeping that technique that
still<00:02:32.080> feels<00:02:32.860> foreign<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.030> also<00:02:34.180> letting<00:02:34.540> go

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
still feels foreign but also letting go

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
still feels foreign but also letting go
and<00:02:35.069> performing<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.190> enjoying<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.910> moment

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
and performing and enjoying the moment

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.080 
and performing and enjoying the moment
it's<00:02:37.720> not<00:02:37.810> easy<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.790> whole

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
it's not easy and it's it's a whole

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.819 
it's not easy and it's it's a whole
different<00:02:40.269> art<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.079> challenge<00:02:41.650> and

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
different art and it's a challenge and

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.590 
different art and it's a challenge and
it's<00:02:41.950> something<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.310> I've<00:02:43.030> always<00:02:43.329> kind<00:02:43.570> of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
it's something that I've always kind of

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.140 
it's something that I've always kind of
wanted<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.019> try<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.829> do<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.370> already<00:02:45.970> knew<00:02:46.120> that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
wanted to try to do I already knew that

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.390 
wanted to try to do I already knew that
I<00:02:46.329> was<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> very<00:02:46.989> talented<00:02:47.260> company<00:02:48.040> but

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
I was in the very talented company but

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.360 
I was in the very talented company but
these<00:02:49.299> dancers<00:02:49.690> cannot<00:02:50.079> really

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
these dancers cannot really

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.569 
these dancers cannot really
and<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:52.450> impressed
