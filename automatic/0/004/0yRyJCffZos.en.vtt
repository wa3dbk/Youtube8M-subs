00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.610

are<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.770> Fuji<00:00:50.219> K<00:00:50.430> series<00:00:50.730> guides<00:00:51.379> now<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
are the Fuji K series guides now as you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
are the Fuji K series guides now as you
can<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.980> guys<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.430> slightly

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
can see these guys are slightly

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
can see these guys are slightly
different<00:00:53.879> from<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> norm<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.649> benefit

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
different from the norm but the benefit

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950 
different from the norm but the benefit
of<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.309> guides<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.879> as<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
of these guides are as you can see that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
of these guides are as you can see that
the<00:00:58.050> ice<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.859> bent<00:00:59.190> forward<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.000> sloped

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the ice is bent forward it sloped

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.130 
the ice is bent forward it sloped
forward<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.379> arms<00:01:02.449> help<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> channel<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
forward and the arms help to channel the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
forward and the arms help to channel the
line<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.979> blank<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.489> down<00:01:05.790> through<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
line off the blank and down through the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.899 
line off the blank and down through the
guide<00:01:06.600> itself<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.650> eliminates<00:01:07.830> book<00:01:08.700> for

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
guide itself so this eliminates book for

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.200 
guide itself so this eliminates book for
apps<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> tangles<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.650> also<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.820> line<00:01:12.030> will

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
apps and tangles and also the line will

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
apps and tangles and also the line will
travel<00:01:12.450> smoother<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.260> quicker<00:01:13.470> through<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
travel smoother and quicker through the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.640 
travel smoother and quicker through the
