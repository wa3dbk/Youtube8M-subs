00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you don't have to do it to move on I'm

you don't have to do it to move on I'm
gonna<00:00:29.820> include<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.779> also<00:00:31.140> learned<00:00:31.470> about

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
gonna include that I also learned about

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.790 
gonna include that I also learned about
rests<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:33.120> said<00:00:33.180> previous<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.200> pretty

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
rests as I said previous I'm pretty

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.490 
rests as I said previous I'm pretty
familiar<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.280> rests<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.120> notes<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
familiar with rests and notes in the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680 
familiar with rests and notes in the
treble<00:00:37.950> clef<00:00:37.980> anyway<00:00:38.520> still<00:00:39.120> struggling<00:00:39.629> with

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
treble clef anyway still struggling with

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
treble clef anyway still struggling with
the<00:00:39.840> bass<00:00:39.989> clef<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.710> also<00:00:40.980> learned<00:00:41.370> in

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the bass clef of it I also learned in

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.200 
the bass clef of it I also learned in
versions<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.629> course<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.670> had<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> root

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
versions of course so we had the root

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
versions of course so we had the root
chord<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> first<00:00:46.800> inversion<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
chord and then the first inversion and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
chord and then the first inversion and
now<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.420> working<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> second

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
now we're working on the second

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.319 
now we're working on the second
inversions<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> move<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.570> says<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.260> must

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
inversions so to move on it says I must

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
inversions so to move on it says I must
play<00:00:54.329> Amazing<00:00:54.719> Grace<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> correct

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
play Amazing Grace with the correct

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
play Amazing Grace with the correct
fingering<00:00:56.520> notes<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> rhythm

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.080 

and<00:01:31.750> I'm<00:01:32.650> also<00:01:32.860> going<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.369> include<00:01:33.940> that

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
and I'm also going to include that

00:01:34.090 --> 00:02:10.570 
and I'm also going to include that
finger<00:01:34.900> dexterity<00:01:35.140> thing<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.490> telling<00:01:36.850> go<00:01:37.000> out

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:24.290 

you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.230 

and<00:02:25.800> don't<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.310> got<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
and don't think that I got that in the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.790 
and don't think that I got that in the
first<00:02:28.510> time<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.290> I'm<00:02:29.410> some<00:02:29.710> piano<00:02:30.580> playing

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
first time and I'm some piano playing

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.710 
first time and I'm some piano playing
phenomenon<00:02:32.800> because<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.460> guarantee<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.420> took

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
phenomenon because I guarantee it took

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:49.560 
phenomenon because I guarantee it took
many<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.560> take<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.790> get<00:02:36.910> right<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.790> says<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.360> can

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
many a take to get right it says I can

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.030 
many a take to get right it says I can
play<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.020> second<00:02:50.470> inversions<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.280> C<00:02:52.200> F<00:02:54.210> G<00:02:55.210> a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
play the second inversions of C F G a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.810 
play the second inversions of C F G a
minor<00:02:57.900> D<00:02:58.900> minor<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.420> e<00:03:01.420> minor<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:03.670> can

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
minor D minor and e minor you can

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.630 
minor D minor and e minor you can
identify<00:03:03.970> whole<00:03:04.870> rests<00:03:05.590> half<00:03:05.830> rests<00:03:06.280> quarter

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
you can play the second inversion

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can play the second inversion
progression<00:03:15.820> in<00:03:16.030> c
