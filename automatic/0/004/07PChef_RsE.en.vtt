00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.220
 you present a bag that I come 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.740
 to buy it is a backpack of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.490
 motorcycles backpack that can also serve as 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.679
 motorcycle bags this is a bag your 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.730
 bike is a bag that is not yet 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.189
 well known but many 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.920
 several merchants levante already so he 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.560
 This is a bag of type if you want 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.019
 backpack a little bit realized in a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 canvas very sturdy a little antoine way 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.340
 of trucks it is a priori perfectly 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 waterproof its closing system 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 based on a system that is 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.010
 used in some that that army 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.370
 a strap so that I will introduce you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.719
 a little bit later so this bag comes with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:57.020
 a shoulder strap that clicks here 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:03.979
 and here 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:08.369
 here and you on the other side sir 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:15.350
 it's a backpack with a support 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:19.920
 as much techt oral here as abdominal 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 so here is to transform the bag into 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.770
 motorcycle bag of course they thought about 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:34.409
 all so you can click that's it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.329
 just scratchs and so good I'm going 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.990
 not lie to you 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:45.090
 this bag inspires the robustness in 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 thongs here you end up with 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:55.170
 a real backpack if you want with here here 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 and on the other side the same thing from the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.780
 same way loops for them 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.080
 200 backs that are provided with a small 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.869
 precision it is the soc 50 liters 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 I pray them a white in 50 liters 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.390
 seems that it also exists in black or in 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.420
 orange 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.010
 but if you take the 30 liters that is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.960
 a little less high and a little less 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.810
 of diameter a little lower it is 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.580
 also available in red 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.470
 here 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 sincerely this bag once put on the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.710
 back same charge and you will feel it 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.040
 can we say because already basic 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.750
 it weighs less than a kilo 7 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.910
 so it's still an extremely bag 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.250
 light for for the volume that he can 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.100
 contain and then that he's pretty good 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.780
 adapted to the use of the motorcycle since in 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.959
 more of being a good backpack he does that 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.820
 that of salt so it's not bad I 'm going 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.910
 now introduce you to the system of 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:08.100
 closing then to have always 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:11.519
 so that's based on you already see 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.459
 something once it is opened 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.120
 it's easy to load because it's 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.920
 of the big canvas 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.660
 you can give a little shape that 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.550
 you want it anyway it holds well 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.709
 in cylinder like that he holds well 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.530
 standing so you could easily the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.440
 loaded then so once you 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:38.410
 did that to close it then with 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:41.050
 a law it's going to be a bit complicated you 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.930
 close the scratch with one hand 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:50.019
 really less easy than tomorrow then 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.720
 behind you to see you have one 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.930
 harder plastic soundtrack that you 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.140
 actually allows to roll up to fly 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.140
 around 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.769
 once that's done it's all 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.930
 stupid 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.890
 I would have more to come bring this clip 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.519
 here and this clip this what I'm going to do 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.419
 right now 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.989
 here and so you have a closed bag 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.430
 completely waterproof 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:26.630
 beefy and light I think are the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.910
 main arguments of this bag in white 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.580
 I chose to take it in white 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.259
 for two reasons first reason because 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.720
 that he was available immediately that 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.430
 in this color is second reason 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.470
 because I told myself that motorcycle poems 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.349
 as a bag of salt maybe it was better 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.900
 if they were more visible then already 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.849
 you have reflective steps too 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.389
 I have no lamp on me but they 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.970
 reflect the lights very well and 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.599
 bomb I told myself that a white bag that 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.460
 is still better off by far 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:06.580
 so that was the presentation of my 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:11.319
 bike bag so for info this bag listening 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.319
 a little over 65 euros 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.280
 there are several stores that him that they 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.569
 sell 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.360
 I suggest you simply type 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.680
 your bike on the internet I do not count 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.139
 to advertise for a store rather 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.039
 than another 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.849
 So here is a bag anyway 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:33.820
 seriously and I think he'll bring me 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.820
 thank you thank you
