what's up guys I know what you're

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.300 
what's up guys I know what you're
thinking<00:00:03.149> what<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.170> heck<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.859> Jeremy

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
thinking what the heck is this Jeremy

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.120 
thinking what the heck is this Jeremy
what<00:00:05.970> are<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.150> doing<00:00:06.450> now<00:00:06.660> well<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
what are you doing now well this is the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.129 
what are you doing now well this is the
carbon<00:00:08.460> filter<00:00:08.580> trick<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.300> know<00:00:09.750> there's<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.019> lot

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
carbon filter trick I know there's a lot

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.509 
carbon filter trick I know there's a lot
of<00:00:10.170> things<00:00:10.410> out<00:00:10.559> there<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:11.010> purify<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
of things out there that can purify the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.490 
of things out there that can purify the
air<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.570> cheaper<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.080> this

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
air for you for a lot cheaper but this

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.290 
air for you for a lot cheaper but this
is<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.630> it<00:00:15.630> works<00:00:16.020> really<00:00:16.199> well

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
is how I do it and it works really well

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.570 
is how I do it and it works really well
you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.449> actually<00:00:18.600> take<00:00:18.960> multiple<00:00:19.580> carbon

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you can actually take multiple carbon

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220 
you can actually take multiple carbon
filters<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.359> place<00:00:21.930> them<00:00:22.080> throughout

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
filters like this place them throughout

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.759 
filters like this place them throughout
your<00:00:22.380> room<00:00:22.529> hook<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.460> fan<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
your room hook them up to one fan and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.200 
your room hook them up to one fan and
completely<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:26.460> clean<00:00:26.939> air<00:00:27.150> all<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> time

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
completely have clean air all the time

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.370 
completely have clean air all the time
let's<00:00:30.210> talk<00:00:30.359> about<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.750> carbon<00:00:31.019> filter

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
let's talk about this carbon filter

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
let's talk about this carbon filter
carbon<00:00:31.830> filter<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.160> filter<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.730> all

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
carbon filter is gonna filter out all

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.130 
carbon filter is gonna filter out all
the<00:00:33.300> dust<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> crap<00:00:34.950> that's<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> air

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
the dust all the crap that's in the air

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.450 
the dust all the crap that's in the air
pulled<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.290> by<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> fan<00:00:37.770> pushed<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.430> through

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
pulled out by the fan pushed out through

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
pulled out by the fan pushed out through
this<00:00:38.850> air<00:00:39.149> duct<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.370> nasty<00:00:41.370> air<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:42.260> fresh

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this air duct so nasty air in fresh

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529 
this air duct so nasty air in fresh
clean<00:00:43.530> air<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.890> okay<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.210> thing<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
