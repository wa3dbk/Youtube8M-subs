of doing it and I am not good at the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
of doing it and I am not good at the
loop<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.490> any<00:01:11.640> standards<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.479> implement

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
loop by any standards but I do implement

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
loop by any standards but I do implement
some<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.860> strategy<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> attack<00:01:15.119> so
