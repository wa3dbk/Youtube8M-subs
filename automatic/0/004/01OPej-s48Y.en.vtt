frg 22 build is the best one to have as

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.999 
frg 22 build is the best one to have as
of<00:01:54.790> now<00:01:55.030> because<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.320> very<00:01:56.890> very

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009

is what I always pick it does have the
performance<00:04:20.359> in<00:04:20.479> UI<00:04:20.720> interface<00:04:21.139> tweaks<00:04:21.909> it's

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
performance in UI interface tweaks it's

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.760 
performance in UI interface tweaks it's
not<00:04:23.120> too<00:04:23.539> much<00:04:23.720> stuff<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.199> there<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.590> has<00:04:24.740> a

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
not too much stuff in there it has a

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.620 
not too much stuff in there it has a
built-in<00:04:25.280> overclocking<00:04:26.120> thing<00:04:26.389> which<00:04:26.599> is

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
built-in overclocking thing which is

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.010 
built-in overclocking thing which is
great<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.289> don't<00:04:28.070> think<00:04:28.130> most<00:04:28.840> realms<00:04:29.840> don't

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
great I don't think most realms don't

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.810 
great I don't think most realms don't
have<00:04:30.229> that<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:30.830> it's<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.130> grid<00:04:31.340> they<00:04:31.520> built<00:04:31.699> in

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
have that so it's a grid they built in
