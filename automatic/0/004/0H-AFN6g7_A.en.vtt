00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.059
 Today we show some skates 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.510
 tips for beginners and then I would 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.760
 say 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.830
 Let's start our first tip 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.630
 here on a skateboard at new 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 bought skateboards always like that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.220
 It's still pretty solid 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.850
 just a wrench and then 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.700
 I do not know if I'm in here 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.840
 Here's just a little bit on it 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.460
 axles looser 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.990
 then you can bend better 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.800
 drive that is actually much better 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.300
 and then I would say to the next 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 Tip 2 put the five 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 At the presentation it is important that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 one demands exactly those with the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 rear foot not far forward not so 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.970
 far back stands with the front foot 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.730
 I will personally the variant so 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.839
 like most screws here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 moved around in the back so here 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.210
 runs one says actually a good 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.040
 feet position and when schÃ¼tten make 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.640
 I always keep my foot so far in advance 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.580
 China little and when I drive normally 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.259
 without a shed then then stands 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.770
 I give them a little back 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:22.940
 not a right angle here but yes 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.390
 yes, then I would say go on 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.119
 Lesson 3 driving the legs in the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.950
 bring the right position 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.640
 when steering to the desired side 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.090
 But do not lean that the wheels in the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090
 are air 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.310
 runterfahren provide the board lesson 4 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.150
 Everyone knows the distant curb 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.159
 down and the word stays 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.310
 a little tip went 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.750
 easy 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.759
 if you drive on the watch a train 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.810
 behind the foot a bit further 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.090
 behind sat here and then just 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.439
 just a little high as well not so 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.099
 it just as with me now patients 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.099
 just expose a bit 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.300
 then when on the curb too 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.130
 owe the front wheels already 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.330
 Almost on board, I was almost like 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.489
 earlier then a little where so then one 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.850
 say little if you want something more 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.650
 speed then just has high 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.019
 and then you just fall down 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.690
 and I do not hear anything 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.690
 we all have to be careful that one 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.790
 Demand foot does not slip off the rear foot 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.860
 not to look slips off 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.230
 broken and a bit that 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 keep balance yes and very important 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.440
 do not top it if you 're over the top 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.500
 Curb ride does not expose because 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.709
 then it slows down then can ye 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.230
 plonk 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.340
 So just a little to pick 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.340
 Now we'll show you the brack 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.990
