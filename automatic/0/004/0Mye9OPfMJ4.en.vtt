00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.430
 hey people and we come to my new one 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.799
 video here in the video I want you 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.570
 just show how we are a particular one 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.510
 solve problem we have one here 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.160
 KrÃ¶mer connection in a car 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.690
 everything is gone through here we have to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 Renew and have the connection here 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.860
 the following problem are the screws 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.450
 demolished what can you make here 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.370
 we can get this back in the picture 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.480
 that's always a bit of a bird here 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.390
 you have to really see that one 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.129
 Somehow something comes up 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.690
 But let's take a closer look 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.809
 the braces we see here are the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.850
 screwed off and the best 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.440
 Method here is really with these 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 Boring screws here is just 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.129
 that's pretty hard to do 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 get screwed in these or 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.609
 with these holes are telling them 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.199
 thread in this case a m echter 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.999
 thread and we have to see that we 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.399
 when building this thread is not 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.829
 destroy so first we grind 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.139
 the broken bolts far enough from that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.329
 they are flat but please pay attention 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:04.379
 that you do not set fire to anything 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.090
 we can with us I try that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.409
 please as close as possible to the middle 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.750
 to get there you could prefer one more 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.000
 twice after and then we sit down with the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.939
 drill and drill with one 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.759
 smaller drill on let's just say 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.369
 times four or 4.5 millimeters so we 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.200
 only once in the middle of a call it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.899
 just create a kernel 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.399
 we drill this completely through now 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.310
 let's see that the hole is really accurate 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.100
 This is the case we can sit in the middle 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.679
 now the next larger drill size 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.310
 please look here in the thread 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.479
 table here we have an example m eighth 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.359
 winter so i would recommend using 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.939
 We will continue to drill up to $ 65 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.340
 let's start with the 65 euro and 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.960
 continue to drill on so and here too 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.789
 an important point is with the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 drill a pair of glasses to call the drill 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.509
 shavings fall all over your face and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.340
 Thus, they quickly fall into the eye 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.590
 So please glasses 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.780
 and furthermore it is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.569
 very useful here are some 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.819
 drill extra to lay down this one 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.380
 screws are quite hard and jever 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.030
 the drill wear very much 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.800
 either you lay down several here 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.600
 Drill out that you can switch or 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.550
 you may drag them then the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.620
 always drill in between 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.270
 so you have a sharp drill 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.730
 and can work properly 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.390
 so now we have a little bit of 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.340
 the remaining bolt in the hole in it 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.420
 stuck to remove that now go 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.400
 we proceed as follows 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.240
 We take the burner and heat 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.610
 this piece so far that it almost 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.160
 glows and now you have two methods 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.810
 he either cools it off and hopes that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.600
 it shrinks so much that it shrinks 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.490
 get out or you leave it so hot 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.130
 and take a thorn and blow is 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.410
 Carefully, you have done this now 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.270
 is now just your thread 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.250
 cut and now you can do it 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:59.460
 use again and we can 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.290
 but we start to bend again and 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.090
 That's how I come to the end of my life 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.830
 videos has the video you would like 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.270
 I expect a thumbs up 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.530
 probably you more my videos look 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.850
 Just click here and there on the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.430
 Note here I have you again 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.630
 some similar videos wants to link 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.370
 you can see more of my videos
