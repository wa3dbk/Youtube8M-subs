this one I'm gonna be showing you guys

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.970 
this one I'm gonna be showing you guys
how<00:00:15.339> to<00:00:15.580> levitate<00:00:16.150> a<00:00:16.539> military<00:00:17.080> fighter<00:00:17.590> jet

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
how to levitate a military fighter jet

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.810 
how to levitate a military fighter jet
AKA<00:00:18.610> vp<00:00:19.150> 996<00:00:19.900> laser<00:00:20.170> so<00:00:20.560> yeah<00:00:21.220> without<00:00:21.490> any

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
AKA vp 996 laser so yeah without any

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.370 
AKA vp 996 laser so yeah without any
further<00:00:22.030> ado<00:00:22.240> let's<00:00:22.690> just<00:00:22.840> go<00:00:22.930> in<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.230> hop

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
further ado let's just go in and hop

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.770 
further ado let's just go in and hop
right<00:00:23.740> into<00:00:23.920> this<00:00:24.280> video<00:00:24.640> so<00:00:25.030> obviously<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
right into this video so obviously the

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.930 
right into this video so obviously the
first<00:00:26.020> step<00:00:26.320> is<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.530> get<00:00:27.010> a<00:00:27.190> military<00:00:27.430> fighter

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
first step is to get a military fighter

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.670 
first step is to get a military fighter
jet<00:00:28.210> from<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.570> military<00:00:28.750> base<00:00:29.230> that's<00:00:29.500> very

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
jet from the military base that's very

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.010 
jet from the military base that's very
easy<00:00:29.770> now<00:00:30.190> since<00:00:30.520> you<00:00:30.640> can<00:00:30.850> make<00:00:31.540> a<00:00:31.570> lester

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
easy now since you can make a lester

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.440 
easy now since you can make a lester
turn<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.739> blind<00:00:33.100> eye<00:00:33.340> right<00:00:33.610> at<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.820> cops<00:00:34.090> turn

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
turn a blind eye right at the cops turn

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.180 
turn a blind eye right at the cops turn
a<00:00:34.480> blind<00:00:34.660> eye<00:00:34.930> but<00:00:35.440> essentially<00:00:35.859> you<00:00:35.980> want<00:00:36.129> to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
a blind eye but essentially you want to

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.619 
a blind eye but essentially you want to
fly<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.579> air<00:00:36.699> you<00:00:36.850> want<00:00:36.999> to<00:00:37.089> put<00:00:37.300> out<00:00:37.420> your

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
fly in the air you want to put out your

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.989 
fly in the air you want to put out your
wheels<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.350> then<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:38.890> want<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.100> hold<00:00:39.429> down<00:00:39.730> on

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:39.999 
wheels and then you want to hold down on

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.569 
wheels and then you want to hold down on
the<00:00:40.059> left<00:00:40.480> trigger<00:00:40.809> so<00:00:41.409> essentially<00:00:42.370> what

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
the left trigger so essentially what

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.459 
the left trigger so essentially what
that<00:00:42.640> does<00:00:42.999> it<00:00:43.149> makes<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.570> plane<00:00:43.809> break<00:00:44.260> and

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
that does it makes the plane break and

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.439 
that does it makes the plane break and
then<00:00:45.070> periodically<00:00:45.609> you<00:00:45.909> want<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.179> point<00:00:46.329> your

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
then periodically you want to point your

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.689 
then periodically you want to point your
nose<00:00:46.690> up<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.230> then<00:00:47.800> periodically<00:00:48.159> you<00:00:48.550> want

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
nose up and then periodically you want

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.610 
nose up and then periodically you want
to<00:00:48.760> press<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.210> acceleration<00:00:49.899> button<00:00:50.289> so<00:00:50.469> this

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
to press the acceleration button so this

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.110 
to press the acceleration button so this
is<00:00:50.739> actually<00:00:50.890> kind<00:00:51.339> of<00:00:51.429> difficult<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.909> get<00:00:52.089> a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
is actually kind of difficult to get a

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.149 
is actually kind of difficult to get a
hang<00:00:52.359> of<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.749> it's<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.440> little<00:00:53.649> bit<00:00:53.769> confusing

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
hang of and it's a little bit confusing

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.709 
hang of and it's a little bit confusing
so<00:00:54.429> let<00:00:54.640> me<00:00:54.699> just<00:00:54.879> tell<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.059> guys<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.420> steps

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
so let me just tell you guys the steps

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.079 
so let me just tell you guys the steps
once<00:00:56.079> again<00:00:56.409> real<00:00:56.620> quickly<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.280> first<00:00:57.609> step<00:00:57.789> is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
once again real quickly so first step is

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.599 
once again real quickly so first step is
to<00:00:58.329> fly<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.050> air<00:00:59.140> obviously<00:00:59.800> second<00:01:00.429> step

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
to fly in the air obviously second step

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.610 
to fly in the air obviously second step
is<00:01:00.760> put<00:01:00.969> out<00:01:01.059> your<00:01:01.239> wheels<00:01:01.539> third<00:01:01.899> step<00:01:02.199> point

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
is put out your wheels third step point

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.189 
is put out your wheels third step point
your<00:01:02.739> nose<00:01:02.979> up<00:01:03.309> for<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> step<00:01:04.330> hold<00:01:04.600> down<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
your nose up for a step hold down the

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.350 
your nose up for a step hold down the
left<00:01:05.229> trigger<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:06.130> you're<00:01:06.280> breaking<00:01:06.760> in<00:01:06.909> fifth

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
left trigger so you're breaking in fifth

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.569 
left trigger so you're breaking in fifth
step<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.079> periodically<00:01:08.770> press<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.399> right

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
step is to periodically press the right

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.810 
step is to periodically press the right
trigger<00:01:09.850> aka<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:11.020> acceleration<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.040> yeah

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
trigger aka the acceleration so yeah

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.399 
trigger aka the acceleration so yeah
that's<00:01:13.149> pretty<00:01:13.390> much<00:01:13.810> what<00:01:14.020> I'm<00:01:14.110> doing<00:01:14.320> on

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
that's pretty much what I'm doing on

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.260 
that's pretty much what I'm doing on
screen<00:01:14.710> here<00:01:14.920> as<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.369> guys<00:01:15.549> see<00:01:15.820> I'm<00:01:16.060> not

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
screen here as you guys see I'm not

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.870 
screen here as you guys see I'm not
completely<00:01:16.840> perfect<00:01:17.049> at<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:17.590> obviously<00:01:18.159> my

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
completely perfect at this obviously my

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.520 
completely perfect at this obviously my
buddy<00:01:19.060> down<00:01:19.240> there<00:01:19.420> Dan<00:01:19.630> TSP<00:01:20.049> she's<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.289> little

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
buddy down there Dan TSP she's a little

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.319 
buddy down there Dan TSP she's a little
bit<00:01:20.710> better<00:01:20.860> than<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:21.189> am<00:01:21.340> at<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:21.640> huh<00:01:21.939> viously

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
bit better than I am at this huh viously

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.910 
bit better than I am at this huh viously
is<00:01:22.539> doing<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.899> pretty<00:01:23.020> much<00:01:23.259> perfectly<00:01:23.680> there

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
is doing it pretty much perfectly there

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920 
is doing it pretty much perfectly there
but<00:01:24.759> yeah<00:01:24.880> I'm<00:01:25.090> trying<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.479> get<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.719> hang<00:01:25.869> of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
but yeah I'm trying to get the hang of

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.990 
but yeah I'm trying to get the hang of
it<00:01:26.049> i'm<00:01:26.259> not<00:01:26.619> completely<00:01:27.159> perfect<00:01:27.549> at<00:01:27.820> this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
it i'm not completely perfect at this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.480 
it i'm not completely perfect at this
yet<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.240> obviously<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.710> isn't<00:01:29.890> completely

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
yet but obviously this isn't completely

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.880 
yet but obviously this isn't completely
full<00:01:30.969> on<00:01:31.119> levitation<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:32.049> know<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.560> isn't

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
full on levitation you know this isn't

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.330 
full on levitation you know this isn't
just<00:01:33.070> floating<00:01:33.460> above<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.729> ground<00:01:34.090> with<00:01:34.719> ease

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
just floating above the ground with ease

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.679 
just floating above the ground with ease
essentially<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.579> is<00:01:36.640> not<00:01:37.390> really<00:01:37.659> possible

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
essentially this is not really possible

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.709 
essentially this is not really possible
to<00:01:38.320> just<00:01:38.500> float<00:01:38.740> above<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.039> ground<00:01:39.719> just

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
to just float above the ground just

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.330 
to just float above the ground just
without<00:01:41.109> moving<00:01:41.469> it<00:01:41.590> all<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.799> military<00:01:42.130> jet

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
without moving it all on a military jet

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.730 
without moving it all on a military jet
cuz<00:01:42.520> physics<00:01:42.909> don't<00:01:43.030> work<00:01:43.210> like<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:43.899> yeah

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
cuz physics don't work like that so yeah

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.099 
cuz physics don't work like that so yeah
this<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.070> pretty<00:01:45.219> much<00:01:45.369> very<00:01:45.789> very<00:01:46.299> slow<00:01:46.869> for

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
this is pretty much very very slow for

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.919 
this is pretty much very very slow for
the<00:01:47.140> military<00:01:47.320> jet<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.359> yeah<00:01:49.359> so<00:01:49.570> some<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.810> you

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
the military jet and yeah so some of you

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.719 
the military jet and yeah so some of you
guys<00:01:50.049> might<00:01:50.259> be<00:01:50.409> wondering<00:01:50.649> why<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.130> sort<00:01:51.640> of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
guys might be wondering why this sort of

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.450 
guys might be wondering why this sort of
levitation<00:01:52.240> trick<00:01:52.719> is<00:01:53.380> useful<00:01:53.979> in<00:01:54.100> any<00:01:54.250> way

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
levitation trick is useful in any way

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.760 
levitation trick is useful in any way
shape<00:01:54.700> or<00:01:54.850> form<00:01:54.909> well<00:01:55.869> once<00:01:56.409> you<00:01:56.500> guys<00:01:56.590> get

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
shape or form well once you guys get

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.039 
shape or form well once you guys get
good<00:01:56.950> at<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.130> or<00:01:57.460> rather<00:01:57.700> at<00:01:58.210> least<00:01:58.479> decent<00:01:58.960> at

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
good at it or rather at least decent at

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.499 
good at it or rather at least decent at
it<00:01:59.079> like<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.469> was<00:01:59.710> then<00:02:00.579> you<00:02:00.700> guys<00:02:00.820> can<00:02:01.030> land<00:02:01.329> the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
it like I was then you guys can land the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.779 
it like I was then you guys can land the
plane<00:02:01.780> literally<00:02:02.469> anywhere<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.219> I<00:02:03.249> know<00:02:03.490> some

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
plane literally anywhere so I know some

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.760 
plane literally anywhere so I know some
of<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:03.939> guys<00:02:03.969> might<00:02:04.869> be<00:02:04.929> having<00:02:05.200> trouble<00:02:05.679> at

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
of you guys might be having trouble at

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.739 
of you guys might be having trouble at
least<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.039> was<00:02:06.249> having<00:02:06.640> trouble<00:02:06.999> a<00:02:07.179> little<00:02:07.659> bit

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
least I was having trouble a little bit

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.359 
least I was having trouble a little bit
of<00:02:07.780> triple<00:02:08.140> at<00:02:08.200> least<00:02:08.410> landing<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> military

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
of triple at least landing the military

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.940 
of triple at least landing the military
jet<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.899> because<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.020> drops<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.440> stone<00:02:11.530> if

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
jet and because it drops like a stone if

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.250 
jet and because it drops like a stone if
you<00:02:12.069> press<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.090> stopper<00:02:13.540> knot<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.019> stop

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you press the the stopper knot to stop

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.610 
you press the the stopper knot to stop
on<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> brake<00:02:14.800> foot<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.159> red

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
on the brake foot in red

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.559 
on the brake foot in red
so<00:02:16.159> yeah<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.760> kind<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.030> hard<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.209> land<00:02:17.390> it

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
so yeah it's kind of hard to land it

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.570 
so yeah it's kind of hard to land it
sometimes<00:02:17.989> but<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.830> guys<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.159> right<00:02:19.370> here

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
sometimes but as you guys see right here

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.759 
sometimes but as you guys see right here
this<00:02:19.760> trick<00:02:20.030> makes<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.599> plane<00:02:20.870> go<00:02:20.900> extremely

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
this trick makes the plane go extremely

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.130 
this trick makes the plane go extremely
slow<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.549> I<00:02:22.610> got<00:02:22.790> super<00:02:23.180> lucky<00:02:23.209> down<00:02:23.659> why

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
slow and I got super lucky down why

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.020 
slow and I got super lucky down why
those<00:02:24.379> trees<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:25.099> sometimes<00:02:25.489> tree<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.849> break

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
those trees like sometimes tree is break

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.520 
those trees like sometimes tree is break
sometimes<00:02:26.510> they<00:02:26.629> don't<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.049> game<00:02:27.260> so

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
sometimes they don't in this game so

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.890 
sometimes they don't in this game so
yeah<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.819> trick<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.180> actually<00:02:29.659> very<00:02:29.690> very

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
yeah this trick is actually very very

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.600 
yeah this trick is actually very very
useful<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:31.010> kind<00:02:31.159> of<00:02:31.220> cool<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.400> show

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
useful and it's kind of cool to show
