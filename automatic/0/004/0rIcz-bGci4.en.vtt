to<00:04:22.079> get<00:04:22.470> speed<00:04:22.980> once<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.669> get<00:04:23.790> up<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.120> speed

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300

like<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.050> good<00:04:41.289> half<00:04:41.560> throttle<00:04:41.949> you'd<00:04:42.789> be<00:04:42.940> able

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
like a good half throttle you'd be able

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.369 
like a good half throttle you'd be able
to<00:04:43.180> run<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.599> a<00:04:43.629> long<00:04:43.930> time<00:04:43.960> seems<00:04:46.379> it's

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
to run it for a long time seems it's

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.129 
to run it for a long time seems it's
just<00:04:47.759> snaps<00:04:48.759> up<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.150> little<00:04:49.300> bit<00:04:49.860> bring<00:04:50.860> it
