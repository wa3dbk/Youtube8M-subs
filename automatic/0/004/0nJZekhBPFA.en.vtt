certain<00:05:10.450> modifications<00:05:11.380> for<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:12.130> setup

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
certain modifications for the setup

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.090 
certain modifications for the setup
would<00:05:12.550> be<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:13.090> add<00:05:13.270> more<00:05:13.690> blooms<00:05:14.410> on<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.860> pool

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
would be to add more blooms on the pool

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.310 
would be to add more blooms on the pool
to<00:05:15.370> aid<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.880> lower<00:05:16.060> half<00:05:16.419> of<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:17.020> set<00:05:17.200> up

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
to aid the lower half of the set up

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.040 
to aid the lower half of the set up
although<00:05:18.160> this<00:05:18.669> would<00:05:19.060> reduce<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.600> available

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
although this would reduce the available
