this is the sony alpha 450 has been
aps-c<00:00:09.780> type<00:00:10.680> CMOS<00:00:11.280> sensor<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.510> comes<00:00:12.870> in

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
aps-c type CMOS sensor it comes in

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.310 
aps-c type CMOS sensor it comes in
slightly<00:00:13.650> below<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.519> alpha<00:00:15.030> 550<00:00:15.809> from<00:00:16.020> sony

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
slightly below the alpha 550 from sony

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.960 
slightly below the alpha 550 from sony
but<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.009> shares<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.369> lot<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:17.730> same

but it shares a lot of the same
attributes<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.960> example<00:00:19.349> it<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.740> shoot<00:00:21.590> at

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
attributes for example it can shoot at

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.700 
attributes for example it can shoot at
five<00:00:22.920> frames<00:00:23.220> per<00:00:23.430> second<00:00:23.820> now<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:25.230> speed

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
five frames per second now in speed

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
five frames per second now in speed
priority<00:00:26.160> mode<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.760> increased<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> 7

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
priority mode that can be increased to 7

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.880 
priority mode that can be increased to 7
frames<00:00:27.930> per<00:00:28.080> second<00:00:28.380> which<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.740> pretty

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
frames per second which is pretty

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.730 
frames per second which is pretty
impressive<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.850> camera<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.420> class

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
impressive for a camera of this class

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
impressive for a camera of this class
now<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.920> look<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> 2.7<00:00:32.910> inch<00:00:33.239> display

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
now if we look at the 2.7 inch display

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.049 
now if we look at the 2.7 inch display
on<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> back<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.129> can<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.730> feature

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
on the back here you can see a feature

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.670 
on the back here you can see a feature
that<00:00:36.180> Sony<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.690> including<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> few<00:00:37.440> of

that Sony are including on a few of
their<00:00:37.920> entry<00:00:38.550> level<00:00:38.880> digital<00:00:39.620> SLRs<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
their entry level digital SLRs and that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
their entry level digital SLRs and that
is<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> nice<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:42.000> guide<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.230> see

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is a nice little guide so you can see

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.569 
is a nice little guide so you can see
there's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> blurred<00:00:43.920> background<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
there's a blurred background of a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.459 
there's a blurred background of a
mountain<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> man<00:00:45.989> standing<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
mountain here but a man standing in the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
mountain here but a man standing in the
foreground<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.370> that's<00:00:47.520> suggesting<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.149> if

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
foreground and that's suggesting that if

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
foreground and that's suggesting that if
you<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> large<00:00:49.079> aperture<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.800> achieve

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you use a large aperture you can achieve

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.850 
you use a large aperture you can achieve
that<00:00:50.370> effect<00:00:50.750> now<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.960> you're<00:00:52.110> shooting<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that effect now if you're shooting a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
that effect now if you're shooting a
high-speed<00:00:53.670> image<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.780> action<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:55.350> man

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
high-speed image some action like a man

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
high-speed image some action like a man
running<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> still<00:00:56.940> want<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> use<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
running then you can still want to use a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
running then you can still want to use a
faster<00:00:58.140> shutter<00:00:58.289> speed<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.430> handy

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
faster shutter speed it's a really handy

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.740 
faster shutter speed it's a really handy
on-screen<00:01:00.449> basic<00:01:00.989> guide<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:02.100> unlike<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> 550

on-screen basic guide now unlike the 550

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
on-screen basic guide now unlike the 550
the<00:01:03.930> screen<00:01:04.259> isn't<00:01:04.530> articulated<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> also

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the screen isn't articulated and it also

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.340 
the screen isn't articulated and it also
has<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.869> lower<00:01:07.110> resolution

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
has a lower resolution

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.160 
has a lower resolution
now<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.890> screen<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:11.210> does<00:01:11.420> offer<00:01:11.630> live<00:01:11.930> view

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
now the screen it does offer live view

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.050 
now the screen it does offer live view
but<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.380> can<00:01:12.500> only<00:01:12.590> use<00:01:12.740> live<00:01:13.190> view<00:01:13.220> while<00:01:13.850> in

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
but you can only use live view while in

manual focus you can't use it in
automatic<00:01:16.310> focus<00:01:16.700> now<00:01:17.570> with<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.260> manual

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
automatic focus now with the manual

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.219 
automatic focus now with the manual

has a hot shoe mount here and a built in
flash<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.220> flash<00:01:43.460> recycles<00:01:44.270> about<00:01:44.539> once

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
flash and the flash recycles about once

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.340 
flash and the flash recycles about once
every<00:01:45.110> four<00:01:45.530> seconds

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
every four seconds

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.110 
every four seconds
now<00:01:47.740> it's<00:01:47.950> got<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.130> number<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.520> scene<00:01:48.790> modes

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
now it's got a number of scene modes

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.480 
now it's got a number of scene modes
including<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:50.320> mode<00:01:50.590> with<00:01:50.979> quick<00:01:51.310> access

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.060 
including a mode with quick access
called<00:01:52.000> dynamic<00:01:52.300> range<00:01:52.840> now<00:01:53.500> what<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.710> does

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
called dynamic range now what that does

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.550 
called dynamic range now what that does
is<00:01:54.340> ensure<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.729> if<00:01:55.210> you're<00:01:55.360> taking<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.350> photo

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
is ensure that if you're taking a photo

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.890 
is ensure that if you're taking a photo
