00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
right we've now wield this particular

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.809 
right we've now wield this particular
panel<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.840> we've<00:00:04.589> smelled<00:00:04.920> it<00:00:05.069> up<00:00:05.250> spent

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
panel and we've smelled it up spent

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.220 
panel and we've smelled it up spent
quite<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.060> few<00:00:06.150> minutes<00:00:06.600> smoothing<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:07.080> up

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
quite a few minutes smoothing it up

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:22.570 
quite a few minutes smoothing it up
doesn't<00:00:07.529> look<00:00:07.649> too<00:00:07.830> bad<00:00:16.310> about<00:00:17.310> there

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.040 

actually<00:00:23.580> check<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> profile<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> panel

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
actually check the profile of the panel

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.359 
actually check the profile of the panel
difficult<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.510> at<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.660> point<00:00:28.369> there

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
difficult to get in at this point there

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.410 
difficult to get in at this point there
you<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.970> bad

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
you go that's not bad

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
you go that's not bad
there's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.109> bit<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.349> inaccuracy<00:00:31.800> looks

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
there's a little bit of inaccuracy looks

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.910 
there's a little bit of inaccuracy looks
a<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.700> high<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> middle<00:00:36.920> maybe

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
a little bit high in the middle maybe

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.880 
a little bit high in the middle maybe
when<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.870> your<00:00:39.870> look<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:40.800> bit

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
when that is your look just a little bit

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
when that is your look just a little bit
of<00:00:40.980> tension<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.340> there<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.700> once<00:00:41.850> by<00:00:42.000> pressing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of tension on there but once by pressing

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
of tension on there but once by pressing
that<00:00:42.600> down<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.379> goes<00:00:43.800> right<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.309> it's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that down a bit that goes right so it's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.970 
that down a bit that goes right so it's
a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> spring<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> panel<00:00:46.320> once

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
a little bit of spring in the panel once

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
a little bit of spring in the panel once
it's<00:00:47.160> pressed<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.969> correct<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it's pressed down it's correct some of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's pressed down it's correct some of
that<00:00:49.379> will<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.680> trimmed<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.399> said<00:00:55.129> when

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that will be trimmed off as we said when

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.529 
that will be trimmed off as we said when
it<00:00:56.250> comes<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> joining<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.090> two<00:00:57.329> panels

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it comes to joining these two panels

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.500 
it comes to joining these two panels
together<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:58.980> there's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> try<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.300> there

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
together so there there's a try up there

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.100 
together so there there's a try up there
and<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.020> put<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> two<00:01:01.920> together

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
and what you see put the two together

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
and what you see put the two together
the<00:01:04.110> shape<00:01:04.320> looks<00:01:04.559> quite<00:01:04.830> good<00:01:07.820> okay<00:01:08.820> that's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the shape looks quite good okay that's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
the shape looks quite good okay that's
quite<00:01:09.299> good<00:01:10.340> we're<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> weld<00:01:11.790> them

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
quite good we're not going to weld them

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.070 
quite good we're not going to weld them
together<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> moment<00:01:12.659> we're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
together at the moment we're going to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
together at the moment we're going to
look<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.500> making<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.040> next<00:01:14.280> panel<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
look at making the next panel this is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.390 
look at making the next panel this is
the<00:01:15.060> big<00:01:15.299> panel<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.720> sits<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> top<00:01:16.439> that's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the big panel it sits on the top that's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
the big panel it sits on the top that's
quite<00:01:17.700> different<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.479> panels<00:01:18.930> these

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
quite different from these panels these

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
quite different from these panels these
are<00:01:19.290> small<00:01:19.590> panels<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.070> lots<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.460> shape<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
are small panels with lots of shape in a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
are small panels with lots of shape in a
small<00:01:21.150> area<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.259> large<00:01:22.770> puddle<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
small area that's a large puddle with a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.210 
small area that's a large puddle with a
little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> Sheen<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:25.890> quite<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
little bit of Sheen so that's quite a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.300 
little bit of Sheen so that's quite a
different<00:01:26.790> panel<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.299> me<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.170> we'll<00:01:28.890> talk<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
different panel to me so we'll talk to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
different panel to me so we'll talk to
how<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> achieve<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
how we're going to achieve that so the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
how we're going to achieve that so the
next<00:01:31.229> stage<00:01:31.470> will<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.950> anneal<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.549> big

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
next stage will be to anneal that big

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.440 
next stage will be to anneal that big
panel

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
panel

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.260 
panel
to<00:01:35.450> make<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.780> soft<00:01:36.080> pliable<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.850> we'll<00:01:41.030> look<00:01:41.120> at

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to make it soft pliable so we'll look at

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:59.790 
to make it soft pliable so we'll look at
that<00:01:41.390> process<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:58.520> explained<00:01:59.060> previously

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
that process as explained previously

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.950 
that process as explained previously
made<00:02:00.800> all<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.130> cardboard<00:02:01.430> templates<00:02:02.000> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
made all the cardboard templates and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.050 
made all the cardboard templates and
we've<00:02:03.170> cut<00:02:03.350> all<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.590> pieces<00:02:03.620> out<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.760> already

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
we've cut all the pieces out so already

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.380 
we've cut all the pieces out so already
that<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.890> rough<00:02:07.100> blank<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.209> shape

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
that is the rough blank of the shape

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.110 
that is the rough blank of the shape
we're<00:02:08.600> going<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.560> make<00:02:09.770> but<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.550> it

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
we're going to to make but it's it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.760 
we're going to to make but it's it
clearly<00:02:11.600> wants<00:02:11.870> quite<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> bit<00:02:12.320> a<00:02:12.350> wheel<00:02:12.590> its

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
clearly wants quite a bit a wheel its

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.710 
clearly wants quite a bit a wheel its
surface<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.670> would<00:02:13.850> could<00:02:14.060> either<00:02:14.150> possible

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
surface it would could either possible

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.840 
surface it would could either possible
just<00:02:14.900> wheel<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.170> straight<00:02:15.590> from<00:02:15.770> scratch<00:02:16.220> to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
just wheel it straight from scratch to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.490 
just wheel it straight from scratch to
get<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> shape<00:02:17.270> into<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.660> or<00:02:17.959> with<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.290> want

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
get the shape into it or with that want

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.110 
get the shape into it or with that want
to<00:02:18.620> wheel<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.160> absolutely<00:02:19.550> Malick's<00:02:19.880> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
to wheel it and absolutely Malick's and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.210 
to wheel it and absolutely Malick's and
shape<00:02:20.300> into<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.720> may<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.200> using<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.770> forming

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
shape into it may be using the forming

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.370 
shape into it may be using the forming
path<00:02:22.459> another<00:02:22.850> possibility<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:24.050> would<00:02:24.200> give

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
path another possibility that would give

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380 
path another possibility that would give
us<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.590> nice<00:02:24.770> gentle<00:02:25.400> shape<00:02:25.580> bottle<00:02:25.940> over<00:02:26.209> and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
us a nice gentle shape bottle over and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.300 
us a nice gentle shape bottle over and
then<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.140> will<00:02:27.290> wheel<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.620> from<00:02:27.650> there

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
then we will wheel it from there

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.640 
then we will wheel it from there
it<00:02:28.730> will<00:02:28.940> want<00:02:29.120> shrinking<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.350> will<00:02:30.500> want

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
it will want shrinking it will want

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.040 
it will want shrinking it will want
shrinking<00:02:31.250> along<00:02:31.550> damage<00:02:32.000> damage<00:02:32.570> and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
shrinking along damage damage and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.050 
shrinking along damage damage and
knowledge<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:33.560> not<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.980> front<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.730> reason

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
knowledge but not the front the reason

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.300 
knowledge but not the front the reason
being<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.360> those<00:02:35.690> edges<00:02:36.140> are<00:02:36.290> double<00:02:37.070> curved

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
being that those edges are double curved

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.190 
being that those edges are double curved
and<00:02:37.580> rolled<00:02:37.850> down<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.420> meet<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.630> other<00:02:38.840> panels

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
and rolled down to meet the other panels

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.410 
and rolled down to meet the other panels
this<00:02:39.830> particular<00:02:40.160> puddle<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.000> where<00:02:41.269> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
this particular puddle is where the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.750 
this particular puddle is where the
seating<00:02:41.810> area<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.380> car<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.070> this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
seating area of the car is and this

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.420 
seating area of the car is and this
really<00:02:43.970> wants<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.360> run<00:02:44.540> straight<00:02:44.870> ahead

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
really wants to run straight ahead

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.590 
really wants to run straight ahead
aiming<00:02:46.430> at<00:02:46.519> where<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> bulk<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.269> be<00:02:47.390> so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
aiming at where the bulk it would be so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.630 
aiming at where the bulk it would be so
we<00:02:47.750> would<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.110> shrink<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.680> edge<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.519> we're

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
we would not shrink that edge so we're

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.860 
we would not shrink that edge so we're
just<00:02:49.670> going<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> through<00:02:50.120> shrink<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.600> three

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
just going to through shrink on three

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.190 
just going to through shrink on three
sides<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:52.519> will<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:52.760> sufficient<00:02:53.200> so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
sides and that will be sufficient so

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.370 
sides and that will be sufficient so
we've<00:02:54.440> already<00:02:54.590> seen<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.070> annealing<00:02:55.820> process

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
we've already seen the annealing process

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.570 
we've already seen the annealing process
you<00:02:57.380> don't<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.709> need<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.070> see<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.310> women

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
you don't really need to see the women

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.910 
you don't really need to see the women
cross<00:02:58.790> us<00:02:58.940> again<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.170> next<00:03:00.410> stage<00:03:00.680> will<00:03:00.890> be

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
cross us again so the next stage will be

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.670 
cross us again so the next stage will be
when<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:01.880> use<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.150> farming<00:03:02.540> bat<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.900> sand<00:03:03.170> bag

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
when we use the farming bat and sand bag

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.299 
when we use the farming bat and sand bag
to<00:03:04.519> share<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:04.880> panel
