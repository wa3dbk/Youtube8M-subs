00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello girls all good then video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.730
 helps you respond to a technique 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.319
 What is called a blogger routine is a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.139
 Tag cool and with questions 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.300
 Do you frequent me a lot 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.849
 Net brand Audi created a kiss in March 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.160
 and then I just wanted to make two observations 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.699
 The first is that you have asked a lot 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 to do interviews with you and such 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.810
 so I decided to create an e-mail call 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 interview lg arroba hotmail.com that I 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.320
 I will fail to update the look of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 you talk about changing the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700
 questions you can send a blog where 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.579
 Are you going to give one analyzed before and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
 It's over and over there, I'll respond in time. 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.379
 Just tell me and tell you later 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.059
 they publish well and the second thing is that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 too beautiful and surrendered to the mind I will leave 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 Her logic link down here is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.730

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.199
 I bought the lipstick, it was beautiful and ours. 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.059
 wonderful coverage 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.700
 so the pec but first I want to evaluate 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.400
 four people here on youtube the links 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.710

 now a little she is redhead and beautiful 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 so I think she could start there 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.640
 for people and lastly it's in the rate and what 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 She's a beautiful Japanese girl, too. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 sales channel super the company was one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.729
 the first as soon as I accompanied and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.439
 I always tell you to install 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.540
 four Italians and I very much hope that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.520
 It does this tag're also good 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.409
 A French kiss indeed let's go 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.470
 talk to the first question are 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.659
 super cool questions and we're going to 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.090
 first steps takes a video of you 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.939
 passes to be posted 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.119
 so let's go there like me, for example, I 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.619
 trade anne making up her hair never 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.360
 I 'm doing it anyway, I 'm going now. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.369
 a base on some little thing 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.740
 After that I chose china clothes. 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.550
 for fifa that we choose people 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.920
 I had even talked to myself. 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.200
 at 5 pm we wear simple clothes 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.360
 tava so is my little way 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.550
 so what I take this time to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.970
 I put on makeup for about half an hour or more 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.830
 less is not so much half an hour and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.420
 forty minutes later me and my 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.650
 boyfriend, we make the scene 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.940
 I'll ask you, while he's done. 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.280
 stealing and such 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.180
 we put Kadlec and puts the phone 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.940
 on the tripod this light up here but this 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.950
 then we finished recording that each 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.350
 filming takes about 30 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.760
 minutes after I finished recording 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.710
 so it's already passed straight to the computer 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.510
 and already start editing 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.570
 so it's one of my steps 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.970
 video goes on there on your little screen 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.430
 2 how about time do you go 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.110
 to edit a good video this is a while 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.020
 so independent the video of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.970
 six minutes 10 minutes 20 minutes I 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.340
 it takes me an hour to edit any type 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.850
 then it's an hour there 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.830
 edited target 3 what day and 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.020
 time is better for you to record 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.330
 Look at the weekend, for example. 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.930
 Saturday and Sunday I 'm at home in a 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.360
 sixth graph rather wednesday 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.860
 sometimes I'm a little late people 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.180
 it depends on whether the video is already 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.520
 accumulated 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.230
 I'm 20 to bet sometimes I'm 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.459
 delayed can not record the second has 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.670
 I put a video on Wednesday so I 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.100
 Record publisher Tuesday so it goes 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.900
 I'm going to do my people on my behalf. 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.600
 There was a half then no better day and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.310
 but better time and day does not have 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.350
 more time has to from the night 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.010
 I'm already home, I'm already out of school. 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.110
 where everything right with what 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.850
 frequency you enter social networks 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.950
 of the blog all the time 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.830
 the twitter I enter more to leave the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.660
 football tolls and this guy 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.310
 and I will also leave the books of the networks 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.170
 Down here, it's good then. 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.239
 twitter but keep it stapled 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.220
 all the time considered a door that now 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.440
 come to give a diminished but whenever I 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 Whenever I do something I see 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.700
 Anything I'm about to take the photo 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.800
 and such I love shooting facebook too 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.890
 facebook now blame the cool pictures 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.390
 You're going to be sharing there. 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.670
 collaborated with the company with me 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.530
 So it 's all the time I have in the networks. 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.510
 Social Blog 5 How You Organize 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.350
 when you are planning to record 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.820
 videos 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 So that 's what I explained. 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.800
 I explained more or less about the question 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.720
 previous 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.120
 I do not plan much study to post 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.940
 a video recorded in about three days 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.490
 before sometimes until after the time that 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.410
 You gotta post it, I do not want to see it. 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.120
 So much planning, no people. 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.390
 What 's going on, I'm going to see the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.820
 band I 'm already doing it and so on 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.250
 I know where you get the ideas from. 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.990
 videos that you want to record I have with a 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.540
 idea in the head what I saw something 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.180
 from youtube and I want to do it too 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.220
 I just do the time but felt immediately 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.260
 For example, this video was what I asked for. 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.050
 for you will be sending suggestions of 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.060
 tags that I wanted to reply again 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.470
 so this goes with what you do too 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 like because what I said 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.280
 the channel each day that it is more 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.130
 So you're the one who sent me. 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.620
 This part of video 7 has someone who 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.130
 help with filming and so except it was 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.240
 So I already answered, right, buddy. 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.520
 had previous 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.169
 My boyfriend helps me set up scenery. 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.030
 these things for example that neither the video 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.310
 of the young life that also left here 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.200
 underneath the newspaper we had to put 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.630
 a white wall and so the father 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.640
 of the marketing flavia was also and the people 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.550
 is everyone do not need a game 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.979
 bigger production so there I ask for help 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.620
 to the university that my father my mother 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.750
 and sometimes some friend something 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.970
 she helped me in loose skin 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.380
 in these little things like that but it's more here 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.390
 in my room even answer a 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.860
 technique that has something but my 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.830
 boyfriend who stays here to see that the 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.320
 quality is good and the issue is that I 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.970
 I answered then I did it alone and sometimes 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.310
 I want to do something different one 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.100
 opening one thing we still ask r 8 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.010
 bi that saved me the videos tutorials there 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.050
 8 you often access many blogs and 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:11.430
 channels of other warrior streets 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.440
 yes much access is both the blog 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.080
 how much the channel is the access but channel of the 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.599
 What is your blog blog is there are so few 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.370
 a 4 so I always even enter 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:26.009
 routine so 45 close right mother 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.229
 The channel is always coming in every time 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.110
 came the girls making videos have 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.270
 price then until a lot of questions 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.039
 How many videos do you put per week? 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.770
 So this is a question that is 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.879
 generating king's compulsion in the head of 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.129
 all of you 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:44.069
 I'll explain every Wednesday you have a video. 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.990
 the entire fourth channel and even has 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.990
 As a matter of internet but I try 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.060
 spend every Wednesday exactly and some 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.610
 Fridays of the month your post will be 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.860
 every Friday can be a basket in the month 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.539
 can have two depends on how you are going to stay 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.430
 my routine in relation to schools. 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:02.159
 things were a bit tighter a 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.500
 Fire counts two or three but the goalkeeper 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.569
 tie can make day and will end 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.530
 happening every Wednesday and the whole party 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.169
 of the goal 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.650
 last question is made a blog and a 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:17.219
 channel for your readers to know 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.509
 So that's what I was thinking and now I was going 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:21.779
 addressing people is having a friendship 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:22.889
 so great already in relation to the channel and 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.050
 here on youtube 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.969
 so I wanted to let her channel go 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.740
 for you to meet my readers 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:30.960
 who do not know her channel 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.810
 click there I'll leave it down here 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.159
 information votes have a lot of cool stuff 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.219
 It has an effect similar to my channel, right? 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:39.779
 responds hair makeup tag to the
