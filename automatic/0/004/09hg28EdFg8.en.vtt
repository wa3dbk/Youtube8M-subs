00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 You probably know the story. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.790
 told in the bible about the ark of noah 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.150
 Have you seen this movie where a man is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.759
 chosen to build a ship and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.679
 more round round other noah comes 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.710
 making history stays inside the house 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.070
 boat of two tons more than three 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 two meters in length and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.110
 Your José Caldeira has been building for 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 six years when I was a child already 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.430
 had a dream to have a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.129
 I retired when I retired. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.719
 I fish in the sea and found it interesting 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.100
 They ask me 1 and another person gave me 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.170
 any tips I brought do not have the drawing 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.520
 drawn everything done there take from my 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 head 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.000
 I looked at the pieces the boats I was 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.799
 out gay water that was made and brought 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.250
 in my mind was built here are 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.920
 Jose tells that for 27 years he was a welder 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.010
 but he had to retire after 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.160
 lost one eye 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.300
 nor did he give up the job. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.630
 old dream 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.360
 were more than a thousand pet bottles used in 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.450
 structure of the boat he calculates that more 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.100
 15 thousand reais have already been spent on 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.190
 boat building 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 the money saved with difficulty and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.370
 For those who thought she was crazy, her 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.430
 everything proud and show the dreams almost 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.880
 complete the boat if I were to do so 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.490
 it had direct financial conditions 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.860
 to do at once on a basis of 167 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.350
 even completing the service 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.290
 but how have we been doing with the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.930
 resources and tabletop nei took a 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.060
 pocket money here one right maria pocket money 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.869
 a brasilia there was plenty more people 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.410
 does what is left over and this 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.230
 neighborhood 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.200
 the morning star is really the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.470
 retired to the family who says so 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.930
 Jose spent the day working at the bar he 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.310
 spend hours in the bar without eating 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.580
 People have to call for each other. 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.010
 snack but call until midnight 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.560
 bring water to pv-ac otherwise do not come out from above 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.300
 boat and that his dream is to see this 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.430
 boat is not as bad as it used to be 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.310
 it is amazing to imagine that a boat 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.040
 like this got out of hand giving idea 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.800
 just a man everything has a meaning 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.830
 very special saw the tiller for example 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.400
 was all done with a knife and a 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.950
 manually sanded so much effort 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.030
 it will be worth not but not yet 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.280
 we are at sea 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.410
 but the great highlight coming up saw the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.030
 It is expected that the boat will be launched 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.920
 March to September 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.200
 I hope now that the time camsia 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.150
 God willing so God allowing the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.610
 puts in water 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.500
 a lot of people wanting to see if 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.200
 hurt you did not believe my 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.030
 The vessel will see her now already 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.410
 to enter by map 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.870
 Your José has already been visited by 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.390
 the naval engineer and a dispatcher of the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.580
 to evaluate the morning star 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.330
 and to his surprise 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.280
 the boat has been fully approved 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.550
 hand documentation is game time 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.490
 debut the new toy your saying 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.940
 sees the time to command this giant and 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.930
 looks 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.930
 great 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.590
 nothing safer 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.590
 You 're really the incision on the map.
