for<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> curling<00:01:09.810> wand<00:01:10.010> especially<00:01:11.010> since<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
for a curling wand especially since I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
for a curling wand especially since I
had<00:01:11.580> never<00:01:11.820> had<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.450> before<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> got<00:01:13.350> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
had never had one before so I got this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.080 
had never had one before so I got this
one<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.830> Aliexpress<00:01:14.640> um<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:17.280> pros<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
one from Aliexpress um the pros about it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.420 
one from Aliexpress um the pros about it
is<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> curls<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.619> um<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:22.430> didn't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is that it curls really well um I didn't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.859 
is that it curls really well um I didn't
like<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> other<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.750> as

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
like the other one because this one as

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
like the other one because this one as
you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.500> big<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.610> bottom<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you can see is big at the bottom and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.569 
you can see is big at the bottom and
small<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> top<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.860> tried<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> ones

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
small at the top and I tried the ones

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
small at the top and I tried the ones
that<00:01:29.880> were<00:01:30.060> small<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> bottom<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> big<00:01:31.290> at

does<00:02:14.230> exactly<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.890> same<00:02:14.950> thing<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.670> one

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
does exactly the same thing this one

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.020 
does exactly the same thing this one
does<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.560> way<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.460> works<00:02:18.700> is

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
does but the way that this one works is

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.940 
does but the way that this one works is
that<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.630> noticed<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:22.630> takes<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.470> minute<00:02:23.800> to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that I noticed that it takes a minute to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.030 
that I noticed that it takes a minute to
heat<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.250> maybe<00:02:24.820> not<00:02:25.210> that<00:02:25.480> long<00:02:25.800> usually<00:02:26.800> I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
heat up maybe not that long usually I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.280 
heat up maybe not that long usually I
let<00:02:27.430> my<00:02:27.610> stuff<00:02:27.880> sit<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.600> like<00:02:28.720> maybe<00:02:28.930> five

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
let my stuff sit for like maybe five

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.740 
let my stuff sit for like maybe five
minutes<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.340> good<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:31.180> one<00:02:31.420> takes<00:02:31.660> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
minutes and it's good this one takes a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.570 
minutes and it's good this one takes a
little<00:02:31.900> bit<00:02:32.050> more<00:02:32.110> time<00:02:32.500> maybe<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:33.040> 10<00:02:33.370> or<00:02:33.550> 12

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
little bit more time maybe like 10 or 12

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
little bit more time maybe like 10 or 12
minutes<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.580> know<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.910> seems<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> lot

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
minutes and I know that seems like a lot

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.910 
minutes and I know that seems like a lot
but<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.730> don't<00:02:39.730> know<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.420> guess<00:02:41.140> you're<00:02:41.380> kind<00:02:41.740> of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
but I don't know I guess you're kind of

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.950 
but I don't know I guess you're kind of
you<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.090> give<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.480> take<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.930> know

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
you have to give and take you know

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.260 
you have to give and take you know
whether<00:02:44.290> you're<00:02:44.800> gonna<00:02:44.920> pay<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.250> price<00:02:45.760> of

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
whether you're gonna pay the price of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.080 
whether you're gonna pay the price of
the<00:02:46.390> expensive<00:02:46.960> one<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.340> good<00:02:48.550> heat<00:02:48.850> or

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the expensive one for the good heat or

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.650 
the expensive one for the good heat or
pay<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.810> price<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.020> this<00:02:50.320> one<00:02:50.560> which<00:02:50.770> is<00:02:51.660> $30

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
pay the price of this one which is $30

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.440 
pay the price of this one which is $30
and<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.280> takes<00:02:54.490> longer<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.910> heat<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.150> um

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
and it just takes longer to heat up um

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.810 
and it just takes longer to heat up um
also<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.410> noticed<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> closer<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.490> get<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
also I noticed the closer you get to the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.820 
also I noticed the closer you get to the
ends<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:59.410> less<00:02:59.620> heat<00:02:59.920> there<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.990> if<00:03:02.590> I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
ends the less heat there is so if I

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.740 
ends the less heat there is so if I
really<00:03:03.160> want<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.610> tight<00:03:03.850> curl<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.450> try

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
really want to really tight curl I try

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.590 
really want to really tight curl I try
to<00:03:04.810> make<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> curl<00:03:05.920> end<00:03:06.330> somewhere<00:03:07.330> around

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
to make the curl end somewhere around

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.810 
to make the curl end somewhere around
this<00:03:08.200> part<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.740> barrel<00:03:09.130> instead<00:03:09.670> of

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
this part of the barrel instead of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.900 
this part of the barrel instead of
bringing<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.600> all<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> way<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.230> tip

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
bringing it all the way to the tip

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.730 
bringing it all the way to the tip
that's<00:03:12.910> just<00:03:13.210> a<00:03:13.300> little<00:03:13.480> tip<00:03:13.750> if<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.230> decide

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
that's just a little tip if you decide

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.530 
that's just a little tip if you decide
to<00:03:14.920> get<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.190> curling<00:03:15.490> wand

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
to get this curling wand

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.230 
to get this curling wand
try<00:03:17.470> not<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.220> want<00:03:18.400> tighter<00:03:18.820> curls

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
try not to if you want tighter curls

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.510 
try not to if you want tighter curls
make<00:03:20.140> sure<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.470> your<00:03:20.650> curl<00:03:20.920> doesn't<00:03:21.280> end

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
make sure that your curl doesn't end

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.310 
make sure that your curl doesn't end
down<00:03:21.670> here<00:03:21.730> make<00:03:22.210> sure<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.450> ends<00:03:22.600> somewhere<00:03:23.140> in

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
down here make sure it ends somewhere in

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.920 
down here make sure it ends somewhere in
the<00:03:23.890> middle<00:03:24.300> but<00:03:25.300> when<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.510> have<00:03:25.660> long<00:03:25.900> hair

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the middle but when you have long hair

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.210 
the middle but when you have long hair
like<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.650> it's<00:03:26.980> hard<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.700> control<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.270> but

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
like this it's hard to control that but

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.990 
like this it's hard to control that but
yeah<00:03:31.950> really<00:03:32.950> that's<00:03:33.250> about<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:33.670> I'm<00:03:33.820> actually
