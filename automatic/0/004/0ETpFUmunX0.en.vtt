00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.810
 a stop we see them we receive them and more 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.500
 later we make some notes for 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.500
 Internet 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.970
 I imagined there was going to be a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.680
 good party and I have not taken any 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.080
 disappointment on the contrary people very 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.120
 enthusiastic I know that in this region 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.640
 cycling is also experienced very closely 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.670
 and also it's touching me to know 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 for the first time the region and in addition to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.760
 I am very happy to see the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.009
 boys that some I've seen 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 run out and now they see us at home 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.040
 and that gives me a lot of emotion 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.910
 emotion 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.510
 georgina doing to has become 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.310
 now I started when the career of 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.500
 journalism thinking that I wanted to be 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.290
 narrator of a sport that is football 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.540
 American definitely that is also not 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.520
 most common but once I met the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.280
 cycling in the first months of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.500
 professional exercise they opened the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 doors so kindly and 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.150
 I knew the nature of sport more more 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490
 up close with the runners the 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.140
 sports directors the mechanics all 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.729
 the world gave me and gave me gave me a lot 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.310
 information gave me my hand without any 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.710
 restriction and that definitely 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.229
 makes you want the essence of sport 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.179
 nature of them as as athletes and 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.010
 The truth is that I could not take off 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.010
 20 years ago that happened, imagine
