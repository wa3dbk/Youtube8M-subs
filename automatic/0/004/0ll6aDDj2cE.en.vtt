00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
strands inside the 550 cord that you can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.130

people talk about using it from sutures
and<00:02:41.819> everything<00:02:42.090> I've<00:02:42.269> never<00:02:42.510> tried<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
and everything I've never tried that and

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.900 
and everything I've never tried that and
you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.040> think<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.489> would<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.640> kind<00:02:44.880> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
you know I think that would be kind of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.820 
you know I think that would be kind of
the<00:02:45.030> last<00:02:45.239> one<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:45.780> me<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.170> they're<00:02:46.709> not

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the last one for me because they're not

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.080 
the last one for me because they're not
gonna<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.100> sterile<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:47.880> know<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.000> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
gonna be sterile so I don't know if you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.030 
gonna be sterile so I don't know if you
want<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.269> be<00:02:48.330> using<00:02:48.560> unsterile<00:02:49.560> core<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.860> set

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
want to be using unsterile core to set

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.140 
want to be using unsterile core to set
yourself<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.489> but<00:02:50.610> then<00:02:50.730> again<00:02:50.819> if<00:02:51.030> you're

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
yourself up but then again if you're

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
yourself up but then again if you're
bleeding<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.480> death<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.019> save

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
bleeding to death and you have to save

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.900 
bleeding to death and you have to save
yourself<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:52.530> something<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.100> guess

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
yourself up with something I guess

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.610 
yourself up with something I guess
unsterile<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.750> better<00:02:54.900> than<00:02:55.050> nothing

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
unsterile is better than nothing

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.460 
unsterile is better than nothing
or<00:02:55.980> maybe<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.330> our<00:02:57.450> doctors<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.080> watches

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
or maybe one of our doctors that watches

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.559 
or maybe one of our doctors that watches
can<00:02:58.620> pinpoint<00:02:58.980> us<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.430> us<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.910> ER<00:03:00.120> doc<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
can pinpoint us a us and ER doc can you

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.770 
can pinpoint us a us and ER doc can you
give<00:03:00.690> us<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.880> give<00:03:02.880> us<00:03:03.030> some<00:03:03.209> background

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
give us a give us some background

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.400 
give us a give us some background
information<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.319> reference<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.940> so

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
information in reference to that so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
information in reference to that so
we're<00:03:07.410> wrapping<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:07.950> one<00:03:08.069> right<00:03:08.220> now

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.899 

now<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:17.170> course<00:03:17.409> we<00:03:18.040> couldn't<00:03:18.370> make<00:03:18.430> these<00:03:18.640> I

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
now of course we couldn't make these I

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.429 
now of course we couldn't make these I
couldn't<00:03:19.299> make<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.510> myself<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.170> took<00:03:20.349> the

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
couldn't make this myself I took the

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.979 
couldn't make this myself I took the
time<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.980> learn<00:03:21.099> how<00:03:21.189> to<00:03:21.280> make<00:03:21.519> this<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.659> I

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
time to learn how to make this but it I

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.309 
time to learn how to make this but it I
do<00:03:23.049> think<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.500> kind<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.890> low-budget<00:03:25.319> type

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
do think it's kind of a low-budget type

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.190 
do think it's kind of a low-budget type
thing<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.900> invest<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:30.540> we<00:03:31.540> get<00:03:31.659> back<00:03:31.989> into

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
thing to invest in so we get back into

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:48.980 
thing to invest in so we get back into
our<00:03:32.650> area<00:03:33.040> right<00:03:33.340> here

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.229 

all<00:03:49.620> right

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:04.059 

so<00:03:53.239> this<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:53.540> roughly<00:03:56.050> almost<00:03:57.050> three<00:03:57.349> foot

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.080 

rather<00:04:04.670> about<00:04:04.909> 3-foot<00:04:05.360> piece

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.750 

I'm<00:04:08.780> not<00:04:08.989> gonna<00:04:09.110> undo<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.590> monkey<00:04:09.950> ball<00:04:15.760> tell

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
I'm not gonna undo this monkey ball tell

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.400 
I'm not gonna undo this monkey ball tell
you<00:04:16.850> I'll<00:04:17.389> probably<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.139> nut

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
you I'll probably this it of this nut

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.190 
you I'll probably this it of this nut
for<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:18.799> while<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.220> get<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.430> undone<00:04:20.049> but<00:04:21.049> we're

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
for a while to get it undone but we're

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.820 
for a while to get it undone but we're
looking<00:04:21.500> at<00:04:21.620> another<00:04:22.960> probably<00:04:23.960> 16<00:04:24.530> inches

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
looking at another probably 16 inches

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.420 
looking at another probably 16 inches
maybe<00:04:25.400> 20<00:04:25.760> inches<00:04:26.030> worth<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.330> cord<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:28.220> that's

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
maybe 20 inches worth of cord so that's

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.470 
maybe 20 inches worth of cord so that's
roughly<00:04:29.740> probably<00:04:33.040> about<00:04:34.040> 7<00:04:34.760> over<00:04:35.090> 7<00:04:35.240> feet

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
roughly probably about 7 over 7 feet

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.600 
roughly probably about 7 over 7 feet
with<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.750> court<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.860> that's<00:04:37.040> definitely

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
with the court so that's definitely

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.990 
with the court so that's definitely
pretty<00:04:38.419> good<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.690> mean<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:40.490> right<00:04:40.760> here<00:04:40.940> would

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
pretty good I mean this right here would

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.110 
pretty good I mean this right here would
probably<00:04:41.360> help<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:42.550> easily<00:04:43.550> help<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:43.970> with<00:04:44.060> a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
probably help you easily help you with a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.140 
probably help you easily help you with a

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
interlining didn't make some shelters
