00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
take the challenge why because you like

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.020 
take the challenge why because you like
prg<00:04:40.740> where<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.190> solution<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.669> idleness

because<00:04:42.960> we're<00:04:43.169> not<00:04:43.200> idle<00:04:43.650> at<00:04:43.770> all<00:04:43.950> we're<00:04:44.669> a

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
because we're not idle at all we're a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.230 
because we're not idle at all we're a
small<00:04:45.060> force<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:46.500> it's<00:04:46.620> one<00:04:46.830> Ranger<00:04:47.280> out<00:04:47.400> one

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240

Ranger out that first raindrop that hits
you<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.820> makes<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.120> know<00:04:51.360> it's<00:04:51.540> about<00:04:51.630> the
