was different about l2 said he has his
black<00:02:45.280> piece<00:02:45.640> right<00:02:45.819> here<00:02:45.880> which<00:02:46.299> was<00:02:46.569> used<00:02:47.110> to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
black piece right here which was used to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.089 
black piece right here which was used to
be<00:02:47.410> gray

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
so that's sort of an upgrade I don't

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.979
