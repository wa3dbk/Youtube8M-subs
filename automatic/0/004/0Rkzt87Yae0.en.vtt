00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so the seed in the Delta 12s can slide

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
so the seed in the Delta 12s can slide
forward<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.939> lock<00:01:15.270> back<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
a big effect on its performance so Delta

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.030 
a big effect on its performance so Delta
12s<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.540> 12<00:01:28.049> feet<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> still<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> boat
