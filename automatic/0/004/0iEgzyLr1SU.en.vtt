going to take this spot water I'm going

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.900 
going to take this spot water I'm going
to<00:00:30.980> call<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.310> in<00:00:31.429> this<00:00:31.640> okay

more tell me which is more huh this is
more<00:00:53.580> this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.630> less<00:00:55.850> what<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.970> think<00:00:57.210> this

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
more this is less what do you think this

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.790 
more this is less what do you think this
is<00:00:57.510> more<00:01:01.910> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:02.970> what<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> wanna<00:01:03.480> show

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
is more this is what I wanna show

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.530 
is more this is what I wanna show
basically<00:01:04.800> when<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> water<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> same

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
basically when the water is in the same

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically when the water is in the same
container<00:01:07.080> they're<00:01:08.070> able<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.430> say<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
container they're able to say it's the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
container they're able to say it's the
same<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> same<00:01:10.290> water<00:01:10.650> has<00:01:10.950> been<00:01:11.130> blown

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
same but the same water has been blown

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
same but the same water has been blown
into<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> different<00:01:12.030> container<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:13.260> think

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
into a different container they think

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
into a different container they think
which<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.720> more<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.440> one<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.820> want

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
which is more is this one so I just want

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
which is more is this one so I just want
to<00:01:18.119> show<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.660> some<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.170> experiments<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to show you some more experiments as to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.270 
to show you some more experiments as to
how<00:01:20.670> kids<00:01:21.030> understand<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.960> placement<00:01:22.280> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
how kids understand this placement and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
how kids understand this placement and
in<00:01:23.430> how<00:01:23.880> difficult<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.660> them

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
in how difficult it is for them

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100 
in how difficult it is for them
yeshuaa<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.729> tell<00:01:26.940> me<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.630> draw<00:01:27.960> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
yeshuaa can you tell me which draw is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.400 
yeshuaa can you tell me which draw is
longer<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.450> same<00:01:30.750> size<00:01:33.110> all<00:01:34.110> three<00:01:34.290> are

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
longer or is it same size all three are

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.370 
longer or is it same size all three are
same<00:01:34.590> size<00:01:34.860> okay<00:01:35.160> can<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.030> tell<00:01:36.300> me<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.720> which

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
same size okay can you tell me now which

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.690 
same size okay can you tell me now which
is<00:01:37.530> longer<00:01:39.950> can<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:40.980> tell<00:01:41.220> me<00:01:41.370> which<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
is longer can you tell me which is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
is longer can you tell me which is
longer<00:01:43.700> yeah<00:01:44.700> both<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.330> are<00:01:45.510> able<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> see

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
longer yeah both of them are able to see

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.280 
longer yeah both of them are able to see
which<00:01:47.010> is<00:01:47.190> longer<00:01:47.580> as<00:01:47.760> which<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.450> towards

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
which is longer as which is more towards

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.310 
which is longer as which is more towards
them<00:01:49.650> they're<00:01:50.280> able<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.760> understand<00:01:51.300> only<00:01:52.110> if

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
them they're able to understand only if

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
them they're able to understand only if
it<00:01:52.650> is<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.800> same<00:01:53.250> length<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> effect<00:01:56.670> plays<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it is in same length so effect plays it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.670 
it is in same length so effect plays it
like<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.690> they're<00:01:58.020> able<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.380> clearly

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
like this they're able to clearly

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
like this they're able to clearly
understand<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.580> both<00:02:00.030> are<00:02:00.330> same<00:02:00.780> length<00:02:01.050> and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
understand that both are same length and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
understand that both are same length and
if<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.920> move<00:02:02.190> one<00:02:02.400> of<00:02:02.610> them<00:02:02.960> away<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.229> each

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
if I move one of them away from each

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.130 
if I move one of them away from each
other<00:02:04.560> they're<00:02:05.070> able<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.840> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
other they're able to see that one is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.780 
other they're able to see that one is
longer<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.770> other<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.429> forget<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
longer the other but they forget that

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.840 
longer the other but they forget that
this<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.269> displacement<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.049> is<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.519> we

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is displacement that is here so we

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.390 
this is displacement that is here so we
experiment<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.720> simple<00:02:13.500> things<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:13.950> they

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
experiment like simple things that they

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.820 
experiment like simple things that they
understand<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.239> we<00:02:15.540> teach<00:02:15.750> them<00:02:16.049> how<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.680> is

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
understand and we teach them how it is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.400 
understand and we teach them how it is
the<00:02:17.010> same<00:02:17.250> thing<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.880> how<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.230> by

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the same thing and how we are just by

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.100 
the same thing and how we are just by
moving<00:02:19.650> things<00:02:20.160> around<00:02:20.850> they're<00:02:21.390> able<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.930> no

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
moving things around they're able to no

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.259 
moving things around they're able to no
really<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.549> happening<00:02:24.090> with

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
really think what is happening with

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.640 
really think what is happening with
these<00:02:24.420> things<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.959> going<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.170> show<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.350> one

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
these things I'm going to show you one

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.949 
these things I'm going to show you one
more<00:02:25.680> experiment<00:02:26.250> how<00:02:27.060> these<00:02:27.330> kids<00:02:27.690> think

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
more experiment how these kids think

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.240 
more experiment how these kids think
about<00:02:28.200> displacement<00:02:30.049> whoo<00:02:31.049> balls<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
about displacement whoo balls so I'm a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.759 
about displacement whoo balls so I'm a
can<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.519> say<00:02:32.640> which<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:34.019> got<00:02:34.410> which

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
can you say which one is they got which

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.800 
can you say which one is they got which
one<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.220> same<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.060> say<00:02:36.330> something<00:02:36.720> about

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
one is same can you say something about

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.649 
one is same can you say something about
this

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
this

very good job so again this is the third

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.140 
very good job so again this is the third
experiment<00:04:34.800> we<00:04:35.130> did<00:04:35.160> first<00:04:35.700> with<00:04:35.940> water

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
experiment we did first with water

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.840 
experiment we did first with water
second<00:04:36.870> with<00:04:36.960> straws<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.650> third<00:04:37.860> with<00:04:38.100> clay

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
second with straws and third with clay

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.630 
second with straws and third with clay
they<00:04:39.510> are<00:04:39.570> able<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.050> see<00:04:40.440> this<00:04:40.830> as<00:04:41.010> big<00:04:41.460> because

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
they are able to see this as big because

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.920 
they are able to see this as big because
they<00:04:42.000> have<00:04:42.120> assumed<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.080> nope<00:04:43.740> when<00:04:44.550> the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
they have assumed that nope when the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.480 
they have assumed that nope when the
features<00:04:45.930> are<00:04:46.110> changing<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:46.950> are<00:04:47.040> not<00:04:47.220> able

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
features are changing they are not able

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.600 
features are changing they are not able
to<00:04:47.700> understand<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.630> future<00:04:49.310> they<00:04:50.310> are<00:04:50.400> only

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
to understand the future they are only

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.760 
to understand the future they are only
able<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:51.090> see<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.420> shapes<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.140> say<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:52.590> is

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
able to see the shapes and say this is

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.890 
able to see the shapes and say this is
big<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.370> is<00:04:53.520> small<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.330> is<00:04:54.510> what<00:04:54.720> we

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
big and this is small so this is what we

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.170 
big and this is small so this is what we
contact<00:04:55.290> experiments<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.190> we<00:04:56.490> activities

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
contact experiments and we activities

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.110 
contact experiments and we activities
which<00:04:58.020> they<00:04:58.200> understand<00:04:58.800> slowly<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.880> is

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
which they understand slowly that it is

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.760 
which they understand slowly that it is
the<00:05:00.300> same<00:05:00.570> clay<00:05:00.930> dough<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.350> we<00:05:01.500> are<00:05:01.590> playing

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the same clay dough that we are playing

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.280 
the same clay dough that we are playing
with<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.430> same<00:05:02.640> quantity<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.600> same<00:05:03.930> size

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
with in the same quantity and same size

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.750 
with in the same quantity and same size
size<00:05:05.100> doesn't<00:05:05.750> directly<00:05:06.750> change<00:05:07.200> them<00:05:07.760> into

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
size doesn't directly change them into

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.440 
size doesn't directly change them into
new<00:05:08.970> quantity<00:05:09.630> thank<00:05:10.290> you
