00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.150 
used that and it smelt really nice but
when<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.780> was<00:05:13.050> threatening<00:05:13.410> my<00:05:13.560> hair<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.800> felt

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
when I was threatening my hair I felt

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.000

like and damage my hair worse so I

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.969 
like and damage my hair worse so I
stopped<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.750> after<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:19.470> was<00:05:19.590> all<00:05:19.710> gone<00:05:19.950> I

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
stopped so after it was all gone I

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.500 
stopped so after it was all gone I
stopped<00:05:20.400> using<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.090> tried<00:05:21.300> something

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
stopped using it and I tried something

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.690 
stopped using it and I tried something
else<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:21.930> tried<00:05:22.260> this<00:05:22.590> is<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.190> bottle<00:05:23.520> that

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
else so I tried this is the bottle that

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.629 
else so I tried this is the bottle that
I<00:05:23.820> got<00:05:24.080> um<00:05:25.550> it's<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:26.970> think<00:05:27.539> it<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:28.740> not<00:05:29.039> bad

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
I got um it's I think it it's not bad

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.230 
I got um it's I think it it's not bad
but<00:05:30.360> I'm<00:05:30.990> going<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.950> try<00:05:32.160> something<00:05:32.490> else

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
but I'm going to try something else

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.140 
but I'm going to try something else
so<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:34.100> don't<00:05:35.100> know<00:05:35.160> it<00:05:35.400> smells<00:05:35.550> good<00:05:36.090> and

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
so I I don't know it smells good and

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.659 
so I I don't know it smells good and
everything<00:05:36.840> but<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:37.350> still<00:05:37.650> feel<00:05:37.950> like<00:05:38.010> my<00:05:38.370> hair

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
everything but I still feel like my hair

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.629 
everything but I still feel like my hair
is<00:05:38.700> fried<00:05:39.419> after<00:05:40.110> so<00:05:40.350> I<00:05:40.380> mean<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:40.770> know<00:05:40.800> that

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
is fried after so I mean I know that

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.940 
is fried after so I mean I know that
it's<00:05:42.090> only<00:05:42.300> supposed<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.690> help<00:05:43.050> protect<00:05:43.410> it

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
it's only supposed to help protect it

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.640 
it's only supposed to help protect it
not<00:05:44.310> necessarily<00:05:44.970> make<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.720> your<00:05:46.380> hair

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
not necessarily make it so your hair

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.969 
not necessarily make it so your hair
isn't<00:05:46.860> like<00:05:47.729> damaged<00:05:48.360> but<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.590> will<00:05:49.800> probably

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
isn't like damaged but I will probably

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.040 
isn't like damaged but I will probably
try<00:05:50.280> something<00:05:50.760> else<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.150> mean<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.419> this<00:05:51.810> isn't

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
try something else I mean I this isn't

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.110 
try something else I mean I this isn't
bad<00:05:52.380> it's<00:05:52.680> better<00:05:52.979> than<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.460> trasimede

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
bad it's better than that trasimede

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.129 
bad it's better than that trasimede
stuff<00:05:54.539> that<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.870> used<00:05:55.200> before<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:56.930> I've<00:05:57.930> been

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
stuff that I used before so I've been

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.279 
stuff that I used before so I've been
this<00:05:58.530> is<00:05:58.740> pretty<00:05:59.010> much<00:05:59.160> all<00:05:59.550> I<00:06:00.060> use<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:00.990> would

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
this is pretty much all I use I would

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.490 
this is pretty much all I use I would
have<00:06:01.650> to<00:06:01.800> say<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:03.270> my<00:06:03.690> favorite<00:06:04.229> thing<00:06:04.470> that

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
have to say that my favorite thing that

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.470 
have to say that my favorite thing that
I<00:06:04.950> use<00:06:05.400> here<00:06:06.110> would<00:06:07.110> probably<00:06:07.500> be<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.770> leaving

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
I use here would probably be the leaving

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.250 
I use here would probably be the leaving
because<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.110> smells<00:06:09.260> really<00:06:09.680> good<00:06:10.960> yep<00:06:11.960> it

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
because it smells really good yep it

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.330 
because it smells really good yep it
smells<00:06:12.500> really<00:06:12.680> good

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
smells really good

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.370 
smells really good
which<00:06:13.520> I<00:06:13.730> love<00:06:14.030> Garnier<00:06:14.570> Fructis<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.320> the

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
which I love Garnier Fructis and the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.200 
which I love Garnier Fructis and the
only<00:06:15.620> reason<00:06:15.890> why<00:06:16.040> I<00:06:16.070> don't<00:06:16.700> use<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.030> shampoo

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
only reason why I don't use the shampoo

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.740 
only reason why I don't use the shampoo
anymore<00:06:17.870> is<00:06:18.140> because<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:19.250> has<00:06:19.730> sulfate<00:06:20.450> in<00:06:20.600> it

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
anymore is because it has sulfate in it

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.050 
anymore is because it has sulfate in it
that's<00:06:21.020> a<00:06:21.170> really<00:06:21.920> big<00:06:22.070> downfall<00:06:22.340> for<00:06:22.940> all

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
smells like a necklace it kind of does

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.450 
smells like a necklace it kind of does
um<00:06:59.180> the<00:06:59.390> only<00:06:59.570> thing<00:06:59.720> well<00:07:00.290> this<00:07:00.860> is<00:07:01.010> kind<00:07:01.280> of<00:07:01.340> a

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
um the only thing well this is kind of a

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.340 
um the only thing well this is kind of a
little<00:07:01.760> bit<00:07:01.910> of<00:07:01.940> a<00:07:02.090> negative<00:07:02.330> thing<00:07:02.600> it<00:07:03.170> is

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
little bit of a negative thing it is

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.230 
little bit of a negative thing it is
because<00:07:03.680> it<00:07:03.830> doesn't<00:07:03.980> have<00:07:04.190> the<00:07:04.250> sulfate<00:07:04.910> and

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
because it doesn't have the sulfate and

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.690 
because it doesn't have the sulfate and
then<00:07:05.690> it<00:07:06.170> kind<00:07:06.440> of<00:07:06.530> doesn't<00:07:06.710> suds<00:07:07.190> that<00:07:07.460> well

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
then it kind of doesn't suds that well

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.150 
then it kind of doesn't suds that well
so<00:07:08.270> what<00:07:08.450> I<00:07:08.480> do<00:07:08.600> is<00:07:08.960> I<00:07:09.080> put<00:07:09.290> it<00:07:09.410> on<00:07:09.560> my<00:07:09.740> hands<00:07:09.950> and

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
so what I do is I put it on my hands and

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.520 
so what I do is I put it on my hands and
I<00:07:10.250> kind<00:07:10.460> of<00:07:10.520> go<00:07:10.580> like<00:07:10.610> this<00:07:10.940> and<00:07:11.240> then<00:07:11.960> I<00:07:11.990> put<00:07:12.440> it

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
I kind of go like this and then I put it

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.520 
I kind of go like this and then I put it
through<00:07:12.560> my<00:07:12.890> hair<00:07:13.160> and<00:07:13.720> stuff<00:07:14.720> like<00:07:14.870> that<00:07:15.110> so

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
through my hair and stuff like that so
