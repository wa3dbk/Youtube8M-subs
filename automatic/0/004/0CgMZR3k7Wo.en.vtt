00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.509
 but now you get up between life 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.509
 and death 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.200
 while the sayeh waits to take me to 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.200

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.380

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.879
 and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.730

 dead scientist we are interested only in 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.000
 cure we offer you an opportunity 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.690
 I can think of many reasons to 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.690
 send us to hell but we could 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.190
 least pretend I'm not an idiot 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.890
 you need the cure and it's here in the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.750
 city ​​somewhere and as long as you 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.560
 here you are no typical shit of the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.080
 ministry 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.319
 craig because you care what happens to 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.180
 establish 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.970
 and this is a job 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 no longer 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.620
 just as we do when we have decided 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.310

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.409

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.330
 finalize and the results are good 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.330

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.620

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:41.030

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.890
 it's okay 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.890
