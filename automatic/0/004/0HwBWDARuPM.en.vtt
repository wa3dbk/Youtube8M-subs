00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:53.809
 hand a rent so it's leather 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:57.539

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.230
 knot there is a bit like a big but 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:10.100
 hang them in fact it a little stick 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.100
 but I like the c1 the c1 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 the place when flattering here is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 like that then she is very elastic ya 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.450
 a year against the father that's how 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:35.070
 I have this one but that one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.759
 that's just because I had 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.560
 need no shoes that I like them 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:50.159
 well thought shoes like that that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.200
 I bought vet'affaires or something 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.500
 like that 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.600
 so there are small ones as soon as he is 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.759
 there is something black so a bit like 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 the fight you see I do not have any 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.620
 wells and suspense that's how cgsp t and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.110
 the bone 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.830
 so like that there like this and there go to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 of black 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:21.910
 yes the black of the blue one can there of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.360
 blue with brown the playa not the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.770
 double the brown and the chestnut 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.300
 iced his weapon we can change them as 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.090
 that he puts last this is one of my 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.460
 favorite songs so it's the rooster 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.210
 athletic so the sports cock so there he 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.220
 there is the motive 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:48.250
 so it's real not what you 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:52.870
 want there is that so there already in blue and 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.820
 Local sports there bassÃ©e the leather 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.830
 I believe and I had them at 30 euros 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.870
 instead of 60 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.330
 and then when we lose the aiac and the corner 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.110
 sporty enough is that it does 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:09.700
 the best when they are a little bit more 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.470
 when air released by me from which she comes out 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.239
 a little more detached because otherwise this 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 so dice that's because otherwise it's 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.580
 I make her big feet all that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.150
 so that's how it feels 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.000
