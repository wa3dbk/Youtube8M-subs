wouldn't<00:01:44.130> worry<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
wouldn't worry about that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
wouldn't worry about that
but<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.659> stood<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.680> layout

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
one right before this so I could be

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.960 
one right before this so I could be
getting<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.630> mixed<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.290> um<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
really love that frame it kind of like

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.360 
really love that frame it kind of like
instead<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.640> using<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.330> framing<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.900> photo

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
instead of using it as framing a photo

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.880 
instead of using it as framing a photo
I<00:02:13.430> used<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.480> layering<00:02:14.720> piece<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.409> I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
I used it as a layering piece and I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.960 
I used it as a layering piece and I
don't<00:02:16.099> know<00:02:16.280> there's<00:02:16.489> something<00:02:16.610> about<00:02:16.819> that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't know there's something about that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.610 
don't know there's something about that
that<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.269> really<00:02:17.330> liked<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.989> wanted<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.470> get

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
that I really liked and I wanted to get

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.199 
that I really liked and I wanted to get
it<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.769> exactly<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.489> way<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.790> looks<00:02:20.000> right

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
it like exactly the way it looks right

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.750 
it like exactly the way it looks right
there<00:02:20.420> with<00:02:20.720> before<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.040> had<00:02:22.340> adhere

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
there with before and then I had adhere

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.860 
there with before and then I had adhere
it<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> don't<00:02:23.120> think<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.599> ended<00:02:23.780> up

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
it and I don't think that it ended up

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.720 
it and I don't think that it ended up
looking<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.069> still<00:02:25.489> really

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
looking like that but I still really

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.089 
looking like that but I still really
liked<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:27.260> already<00:02:27.349> know<00:02:27.650> what<00:02:28.010> my

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
liked it and I already know what my

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.500 
liked it and I already know what my
title<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.519> gonna<00:02:28.640> be<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:28.879> this<00:02:28.970> point<00:02:29.299> so

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
title is gonna be at this point so

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.910 
title is gonna be at this point so
sometimes<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.230> title<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.709> most

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
sometimes the title is the most

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.979 
sometimes the title is the most
difficult<00:02:31.069> part<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.000> me<00:02:32.269> whether<00:02:32.750> it's

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
difficult part for me whether it's

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.960 
difficult part for me whether it's
placement<00:02:33.290> or<00:02:33.769> whether<00:02:34.159> it's<00:02:34.370> coming<00:02:34.579> up<00:02:34.819> with

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
placement or whether it's coming up with

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.460 
placement or whether it's coming up with
it<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.329> so<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.510> went<00:02:35.780> ahead<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.049> Gotha<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.349> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
it and so I went ahead and Gotha on the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.190 
it and so I went ahead and Gotha on the
page<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:37.030> that's<00:02:38.030> not<00:02:38.599> like<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.049> most

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
page because that's not like the most

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.170 
page because that's not like the most
fun<00:02:39.500> part<00:02:39.860> for<00:02:40.040> me<00:02:40.159> which<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.730> don't<00:02:40.819> know<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
fun part for me which I don't know if it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.240 
fun part for me which I don't know if it
is<00:02:41.299> for<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.930> guys<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:42.409> for<00:02:42.920> me<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:43.220> not

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
really crazy about placing the title

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.559 
really crazy about placing the title
unless<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.069> really<00:02:46.370> easy<00:02:46.400> like<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
it's very easy plus it makes like such a

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's very easy plus it makes like such a
big<00:02:54.319> impact<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:56.359> went<00:02:56.989> ahead<00:02:57.079> and<00:02:57.260> put<00:02:57.379> that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
big impact but I went ahead and put that

big impact but I went ahead and put that
on<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.739> page<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> can<00:02:58.370> get<00:02:58.489> my

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
on the page so that I can get my

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.190 
on the page so that I can get my
placement<00:02:59.030> right<00:02:59.150> with<00:02:59.329> everything<00:02:59.690> else<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
placement right with everything else and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.860 
placement right with everything else and
then<00:03:00.920> I'll<00:03:01.040> start<00:03:01.250> embellishing<00:03:01.519> so<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.329> went

then I'll start embellishing so I went

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.589 
then I'll start embellishing so I went
ahead<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.230> put<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.859> frame<00:03:04.250> behind<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.390> photo

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
ahead and put the frame behind the photo

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.599 
ahead and put the frame behind the photo
and<00:03:05.959> then<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:06.560> liked<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.159> fact<00:03:07.340> how<00:03:07.549> the

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
and then I really liked the fact how the

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.759 
and then I really liked the fact how the
photo<00:03:08.569> or<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.959> focal<00:03:09.230> point<00:03:09.409> was<00:03:09.500> sticking

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
photo or the focal point was sticking

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.759 
photo or the focal point was sticking
kind<00:03:10.129> of<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.400> tucking<00:03:10.849> inside<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.299> frame<00:03:11.769> and

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
kind of in tucking inside the frame and

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.649 
kind of in tucking inside the frame and
I<00:03:13.010> was<00:03:13.129> gonna<00:03:13.310> put<00:03:13.519> something<00:03:13.760> there<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.450> I

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
I was gonna put something there but I

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.270 
I was gonna put something there but I
think<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.260> decided<00:03:15.560> not<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.799> do<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.069> because

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
think I decided not to do that because

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.129 
think I decided not to do that because
it<00:03:16.459> kind<00:03:16.609> of<00:03:16.640> covered<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.109> I

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
it kind of covered that up and I so I
