00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
 of hope 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.840
 we all follow with great emotion 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 the rescue of the 33 remaining miners 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.320
 buried for 69 days at almost 700 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.470
 meters in a mine of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.019
 gold and copper in northern Chile 's mine 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.379
 san josÃ© in the atacama desert suffered a 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.600
 collapse on August 5, 2010 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.430
 for the first 17 days there was no 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.230
 communication with the outside 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.870
 the miners survived with two 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.520
 canned tuna spoons a sip of 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.260
 milk and half a cookie every 48 hours 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.390
 only on 22 August when the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.610
 drilling has managed to reach the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.610
 that the workers were confined 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.370
 of a voice message and / or laughed we are 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.500
 well in the refuge the 33 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.110
 then the hope of rescue left 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.329
 of being a mirage to gain contours 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.909
 of a remote possibility 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.729
 confirmation that the miners were 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.369
 alive and confident that the support staff 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.310
 government and all those involved in the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.369
 would make the greatest efforts and use the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.799
 technology has brought new 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.229
 camp 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.859
 families near the entrance to the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.399
 mine 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.710
 soon after the accident from there 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.469
 work was accelerated and three 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.820
 different rescue plans began to 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.670
 be executed 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.369
 there was plenty to do 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.580
 run against time but not run over 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.400
 security were more than 33 days 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.130
 intense and careful work until the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.320
 duct ruptured all layers of rock 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.470
 and the final details of the rescue 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.720
 began to be equated with the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 hope camp grew every time 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.430
 more agitated with family members 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.440
 accompanying the work and the arrival of 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.989
 journalists from many countries to 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 order to cover the event 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.489
 finally 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.459
 today 69 days of absolute record waiting 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.599
 in terms of survival the capsule 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.920
 phoenix 2 brings to the surface one by one all 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.890
 the 33 safe and sound miners 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.500
 these last two words that we use 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.920
 almost without thinking of the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.599
 its meaning sums up accurately the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.959
 condition of miners 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.079
 coming out of their rocky grave all 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.849
 excellent health and vitality. 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.680
 in addition to many demonstrations of 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.140
 spiritual renewal 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.540
 since they received the mini bibles 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.329
 sent by the Adventist Church of 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.720
 seventh day until the decision to use the 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.870
 shirts that stamped the inscription 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.109
 thanks lord and the message of salma 95 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.450
 verse four and more recently almost 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.209
 all rescued together with 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.269
 family members fulfill a spiritual 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.470
 in Palestine which included until baptism in 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.260
 waters of the river jordan 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.750
 this fact still very much alive in the memory of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.290
 all of us is another demonstration of the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.200
 importance of the faith of hope and love 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.720
 the three main Christian virtues 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.540
 faith is like a strong arm with which 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.209
 We cling to the divine omnipotence 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.700
 hope is based on faith but also 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.829
 feeds on the evidence of history and 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.410
 of truths revealed by God and 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.199
 focuses on the future include much of 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.900
 expectation and desire while acting to 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.299
 change the realities of the present in this 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.180
 point is that love enters there is better 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.989
 motivation to act to change the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.359
 story 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.840
 this is the fuel of all good 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.840
 actions 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.250
 The audio book you hear now is 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.840
 part of a large campaign 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.870
 developed in recent years in favor of 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.880
 of hope in order to discuss 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.880
 a vision of the future to change the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.490
 president is a selection of only 11 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.070
 simple short chapters but 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.740
 provocative discuss some of the 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.100
 issues that matter most to us all. 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.039
 as the reason for suffering the true 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.080
 peace the afterlife and victory 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.930
 end of god's love 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.389
 they follow a logical order that begins 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.330
 the origin of the problems and ends with 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.090
 the definitive solution but among these 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.060
 two extremes, each of us has to 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.699
 to live your day to day life and in this 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.460
 that hope makes all the difference 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.310
 we have crises all over the world who 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.220
 become apathetic or terrified is 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.410
 placing out of the reach of the solution by 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.120
 other side who agrees to question 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.580
 wait and participate 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.250
 enters a virtuous circle fifth and 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.490
 other elements also dealt with in this 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.419
 audio book as god a safe guide to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.870
 truth 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.030
 The good news is that there is a light in the end to 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.180
 this light is coming to us to 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.789
 light our way is made in the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.159
 message from this short audio book that 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.020
 presents a major proposal that has 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:49.979
