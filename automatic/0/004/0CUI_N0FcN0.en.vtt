a light that lit should look something
like<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.570> next<00:00:30.900> step<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.619> drill<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
like that the next step is to drill it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.690 
like that the next step is to drill it
in<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:33.180> area<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.980> whatever<00:00:35.340> size

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
in this area here use whatever size

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
in this area here use whatever size
drill<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.510> smaller<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.410> better

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
drill that you like smaller the better

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010 
drill that you like smaller the better
and<00:00:38.250> take<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.670> time<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.450> force<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and take your time and don't force it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990 
and take your time and don't force it
because<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.129> brittle<00:00:41.399> frosting

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
because this is really brittle frosting

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.860 
because this is really brittle frosting
and<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.170> cracks<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.190> easily<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.879> I'll

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and it cracks very very easily so I'll

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
and it cracks very very easily so I'll
get<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.320> drill<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> I'll

I've<00:00:51.239> drilled<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> hole<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:52.260> through<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
I've drilled the hole right through to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
I've drilled the hole right through to
the<00:00:53.010> other<00:00:53.100> side<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.989> should

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the other side and that's what it should

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
the other side and that's what it should
look<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.320> approximately<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
look like approximately and then what I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
look like approximately and then what I
do<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.590> myself<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.640> screw<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.469> a<00:01:01.469> nut<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
do is I get myself a screw and a nut the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
do is I get myself a screw and a nut the
smallest<00:01:03.210> possible<00:01:03.510> size<00:01:03.960> whatever<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
smallest possible size whatever that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
smallest possible size whatever that
