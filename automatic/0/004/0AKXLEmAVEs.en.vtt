the carburetor hard to see but anyway

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
the carburetor hard to see but anyway
you<00:01:16.500> could<00:01:16.680> probably<00:01:16.799> pull<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> Reed<00:01:17.340> spacer

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you could probably pull that Reed spacer

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
you could probably pull that Reed spacer
although<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.240> find<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.810> detrimental

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960

although we find that to be detrimental

so<00:01:21.450> hit-or-miss<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.560> test<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.070> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
so hit-or-miss will test it with this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.170 
so hit-or-miss will test it with this
carburetor<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.670> ever<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> run

quite<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.740> hopefully<00:01:25.979> what

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
quite right which is hopefully what

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
quite right which is hopefully what
we'll<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.960> throttle<00:01:28.290> cable

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
we'll get doing but the throttle cable

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.950 
we'll get doing but the throttle cable
comes<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.970> hits<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> frame<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
comes out and hits the frame here this
isn't<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> huge<00:01:31.650> deal<00:01:32.100> however<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.820> great

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
isn't a huge deal however it's not great

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810 
isn't a huge deal however it's not great
but<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:35.040> something<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.640> dealt

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
but it's something that can be dealt

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
but it's something that can be dealt
with<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.689> tech<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.020> know

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
with I think as for tech you know

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
with I think as for tech you know
testing<00:01:37.799> reasons<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> decent<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
testing reasons we have it decent it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.410 
testing reasons we have it decent it
does<00:01:39.720> return<00:01:40.100> that's<00:01:41.100> okay<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.240> also

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
does return that's okay but it's also

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
does return that's okay but it's also
too<00:01:42.689> short<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.320> we've<00:01:43.500> done<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.979> pulled

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
too short so what we've done we pulled

here<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.780> little<00:03:01.290> bit<00:03:01.470> rich<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:02.340> little<00:03:03.269> bit

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
here a little bit rich a little bit

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.570 
here a little bit rich a little bit
clunky<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.080> not<00:03:04.379> bad<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.069> probably<00:03:05.430> how

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
clunky but not bad this is probably how

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.100 
clunky but not bad this is probably how
most<00:03:05.610> people<00:03:05.910> set<00:03:06.269> up<00:03:06.300> their<00:03:06.390> motorcycle

let's<00:03:07.769> start<00:03:07.980> opening<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.459> little<00:03:08.580> bit

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
let's start opening it a little bit

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
let's start opening it a little bit
farther

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.470 

a<00:03:11.250> little<00:03:11.820> bit<00:03:11.940> rich<00:03:12.150> hill

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
a little bit rich hill

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:46.910 
a little bit rich hill
definitely<00:03:15.200> rich<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:15.709> here

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.860 

right<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.670> little<00:03:48.910> enriched<00:03:49.390> but<00:03:49.750> it

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
right so now this little enriched but it

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:06.170 
right so now this little enriched but it
ran<00:03:49.990> okay<00:03:50.350> there

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.330 

so<00:04:07.180> if<00:04:07.630> we<00:04:07.870> load<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.200> engine<00:04:08.500> up<00:04:08.590> again<00:04:08.890> get

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
so if we load the engine up again get

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.780 
so if we load the engine up again get
your<00:04:09.400> rich<00:04:09.820> through<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.210> needle

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.789 

overload<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.900> issue<00:04:14.049> with<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> little<00:04:14.590> bit<00:04:14.680> of

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
overload the issue with a little bit of

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.000 
overload the issue with a little bit of
fuel

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.820 

right<00:04:19.550> here's<00:04:19.790> wager<00:04:20.480> in<00:04:20.720> wager<00:04:21.650> it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.920 

don't<00:04:25.430> rev<00:04:25.580> out<00:04:25.789> which<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.240> great<00:04:26.509> but

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
don't rev out which is great but

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:38.400 
don't rev out which is great but
unfortunately

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.920 

so<00:04:39.880> what<00:04:40.880> does<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.150> engine<00:04:41.480> need<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.750> run

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
so what does this engine need to run

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.130 
so what does this engine need to run
better<00:04:42.110> well<00:04:43.210> we've<00:04:44.210> got<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.390> jetted<00:04:44.810> way<00:04:45.080> to

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
better well we've got a jetted way to

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.980 
better well we've got a jetted way to
rich<00:04:45.590> on<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.890> first<00:04:46.100> parts<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.640> needle

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
rich on the first parts of the needle

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.620 
rich on the first parts of the needle
probably<00:04:48.340> if<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.580> were<00:04:49.670> a<00:04:49.700> pilot<00:04:50.180> jet<00:04:50.390> we'd

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
probably if it were a pilot jet we'd

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.330 
probably if it were a pilot jet we'd
probably<00:04:50.840> say<00:04:51.110> two<00:04:51.350> pilot<00:04:51.710> jets<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.100> about

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
probably say two pilot jets and about

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.370 
probably say two pilot jets and about
three<00:04:52.700> positions<00:04:53.240> on<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.450> needle<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:53.900> a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
unfortunately after half throttle as we

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.280 
unfortunately after half throttle as we
tried<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.210> illustrate<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.930> arrow<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.170> we

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
tried to illustrate the arrow that we

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.690 
tried to illustrate the arrow that we
loaded<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.680> up<00:05:00.830> pretty<00:05:01.010> heavily<00:05:01.250> at<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.550> lower

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.310 
throttle opens taking their time it's
definitely<00:05:04.130> too<00:05:04.730> lean

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
definitely too lean

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.930 
definitely too lean
much<00:05:06.890> too<00:05:07.190> lean<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:08.710> after<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.860> as<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.760> can

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
much too lean and after that as you can

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.000 
much too lean and after that as you can
see<00:05:11.090> once<00:05:11.300> you<00:05:11.450> clear<00:05:11.690> it<00:05:11.780> out<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:11.930> get<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.380> not

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
see once you clear it out and get it not

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.680 
see once you clear it out and get it not
loaded<00:05:13.430> up<00:05:13.550> with<00:05:13.730> fuel<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.300> try<00:05:14.480> to<00:05:14.510> hit

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
loaded up with fuel and you try to hit

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.080 
loaded up with fuel and you try to hit
the<00:05:14.810> gas<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.680> won't<00:05:16.040> even<00:05:16.160> take<00:05:16.430> full<00:05:16.670> throttle

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
the gas it won't even take full throttle

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.490 
the gas it won't even take full throttle
which<00:05:17.210> is<00:05:17.330> just<00:05:17.540> it's<00:05:17.810> just<00:05:17.840> too<00:05:18.020> lean<00:05:18.320> I'm

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
which is just it's just too lean I'm

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.780 
which is just it's just too lean I'm
gonna<00:05:18.620> repeat<00:05:18.890> I<00:05:19.040> guess<00:05:19.310> if<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.670> was<00:05:19.760> a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
gonna repeat I guess if it was a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.580 
gonna repeat I guess if it was a
carburetor<00:05:20.420> you'd<00:05:20.600> probably<00:05:20.810> be<00:05:21.350> in<00:05:21.380> the

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
carburetor you'd probably be in the

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.560 
carburetor you'd probably be in the
range<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:22.040> about<00:05:22.280> seven<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.360> eight<00:05:23.420> jet<00:05:24.050> sizes

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
range of about seven to eight jet sizes

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.090 
range of about seven to eight jet sizes
maybe<00:05:26.570> five<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.170> probably<00:05:27.440> seven<00:05:27.740> eight<00:05:27.890> jet

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
maybe five but probably seven eight jet

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.800 
maybe five but probably seven eight jet
sizes<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.610> get<00:05:28.760> it<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.970> accept<00:05:29.240> wide<00:05:29.480> open

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
sizes to get it to accept wide open

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.540 
sizes to get it to accept wide open
throttle<00:05:29.990> I<00:05:30.320> was<00:05:30.740> getting<00:05:30.920> pretty<00:05:31.130> excited

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
throttle I was getting pretty excited

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.100 
throttle I was getting pretty excited
when<00:05:31.670> I<00:05:31.700> first<00:05:31.970> got<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.480> run<00:05:32.660> right<00:05:32.900> with

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
when I first got it to run right with

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.660 
when I first got it to run right with
the<00:05:33.260> adjustment<00:05:33.950> almost<00:05:34.160> all<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.370> way<00:05:34.460> rich

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
the adjustment almost all the way rich

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.720 
the adjustment almost all the way rich
but<00:05:35.710> unfortunately<00:05:36.710> after<00:05:37.160> we<00:05:37.460> started

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
but unfortunately after we started

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.010 
but unfortunately after we started
clearing<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:38.030> out<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.180> was<00:05:38.540> gonna<00:05:38.630> go<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.870> do

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
clearing it out I was gonna go to do

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.800 
clearing it out I was gonna go to do
some<00:05:39.170> polls<00:05:39.380> on<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.590> dyno<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:41.090> realized<00:05:41.660> that

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
some polls on the dyno I realized that

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.350 
some polls on the dyno I realized that
it<00:05:41.930> was<00:05:42.020> just<00:05:42.200> much<00:05:42.440> much<00:05:42.710> much<00:05:43.040> too<00:05:44.030> lean

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
it was just much much much too lean

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.180 
it was just much much much too lean
still<00:05:44.780> up<00:05:44.900> top<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.470> don't<00:05:45.500> want<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.830> break
