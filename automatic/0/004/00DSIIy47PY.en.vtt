about how to do stone the trick to this
is<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> black<00:00:27.420> alcohol<00:00:28.289> ink<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
black matrix in the in the clay as

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
black matrix in the in the clay as
opposed<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.040> using<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.369> black<00:00:32.579> clay<00:00:32.910> okay<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
couple drops on on the ink and then I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.410 
couple drops on on the ink and then I
spread<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> cotton<00:00:41.790> ball<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> you'll

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
notice because alcohol ink doesn't come

off<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.440> water<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.890> found<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> hard<00:00:47.700> way

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
off with water I found out the hard way

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
off with water I found out the hard way
so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> would<00:00:48.930> cover<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.350> whole<00:00:49.559> sheet<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so I would cover this whole sheet of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.369 
so I would cover this whole sheet of
clay<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:51.000> set<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> aside<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> let<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
clay and then set it aside and let that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
clay and then set it aside and let that
dry<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.770> make<00:00:53.100> sure<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> dried<00:00:53.760> thoroughly

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210

stack of clay and all I do is I cut
matchsticks<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.019> clay<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.820> using

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
matchsticks of clay so you're just using

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
matchsticks of clay so you're just using
your<00:01:06.210> fine<00:01:06.450> blade<00:01:06.720> using<00:01:07.409> my<00:01:07.530> fine<00:01:07.830> blade<00:01:08.070> you

your fine blade using my fine blade you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060 
your fine blade using my fine blade you
don't<00:01:08.670> even<00:01:08.880> measure<00:01:09.000> no<00:01:09.510> no<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.710> should<00:01:10.979> have

guessed<00:01:11.189> yeah<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> less<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
guessed yeah you know me the less you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.020 
guessed yeah you know me the less you
measure<00:01:14.040> especially<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.790> you're<00:01:14.909> doing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
measure especially when you're doing

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
measure especially when you're doing
natural<00:01:15.360> things<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.110> better<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
natural things the better so you make a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
natural things the better so you make a
stack<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.780> add<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
stack of this and I'm going to add in a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.770

just<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.659> especially<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.110> you're

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
just a little bit especially if you're

just a little bit especially if you're
making<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.560> lot<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.829> beads<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> I'm<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.090> going

making a lot of beads and I'm just going

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
making a lot of beads and I'm just going
to<00:01:57.329> push<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> together<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.320> hands<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to push it together with my hands a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.859 
to push it together with my hands a
little<00:01:58.969> and<00:02:00.860> make<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.360> hmmm<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
little and make it into hmmm what do you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.649 
little and make it into hmmm what do you
want<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> call<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.439> little<00:02:04.680> core<00:02:05.009> sure<00:02:05.729> now

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
want to call that a little core sure now

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.050 
want to call that a little core sure now
here's<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.259> trick<00:02:07.530> twist<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> like

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
here's the trick twist it this is like

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.630 
here's the trick twist it this is like
when<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.420> marbleize<00:02:09.959> clay<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:11.069> twist<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
when you marbleize clay just twist it a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.470 
when you marbleize clay just twist it a
little<00:02:11.670> bit<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
little bit and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.110 
little bit and
is<00:02:12.720> causing<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> color<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.400> spread<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
is causing the color to spread out the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.089 
is causing the color to spread out the
ink<00:02:15.569> color<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:16.110> huh<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> gives<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.950> more

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
ink color right huh and it gives a more

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.979 
ink color right huh and it gives a more
random<00:02:17.580> pattern<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.330> I'm<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
random pattern to it I'm going to

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.690 
random pattern to it I'm going to
flatten<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:19.799> hands<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.670> little

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
flatten it with my hands just a little

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.339 
flatten it with my hands just a little
bit<00:02:21.060> now<00:02:21.659> we're<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.019> run<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.319> through

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
bit now we're going to run it through

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.020 
bit now we're going to run it through
the<00:02:22.560> Machine<00:02:22.890> again<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> widest<00:02:23.760> setting

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the Machine again on the widest setting

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.170 
the Machine again on the widest setting
okay<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.379> you<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:26.250> see<00:02:26.580> how<00:02:26.849> that's<00:02:27.060> starting

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
okay and you can see how that's starting

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.150 
okay and you can see how that's starting
to<00:02:27.569> pattern<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:28.950> tell

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
to pattern you then you can really tell

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.490 
to pattern you then you can really tell
the<00:02:29.370> gradation<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.049> can<00:02:31.260> see

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the gradation of that right you can see

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
the gradation of that right you can see
how<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.709> ink<00:02:31.950> breaks<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.060> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
how the ink breaks up and there in a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
how the ink breaks up and there in a
fine<00:02:33.510> way<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> can't<00:02:34.440> get<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.950> use

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
fine way that you can't get when you use

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.520 
fine way that you can't get when you use
just<00:02:35.519> clay<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.299> I'll<00:02:36.900> run<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.230> through

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
just clay to do it I'll run this through

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.550 
just clay to do it I'll run this through
a<00:02:37.560> couple<00:02:37.769> oh<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.519> love<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.260> now<00:02:40.410> you're

on<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.879> paper<00:03:09.090> because<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.540> want<00:03:09.870> my<00:03:09.989> clay<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
on the paper because I want my clay to

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.360 
on the paper because I want my clay to
stick<00:03:10.859> in<00:03:11.150> my<00:03:12.150> cutter<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.410> twist<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.069> just<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
stick in my cutter and I twist it just a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.160 
stick in my cutter and I twist it just a
little<00:03:14.459> bit<00:03:14.609> now<00:03:15.030> my<00:03:15.269> clay<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> cutter

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
little bit now my clay is in the cutter

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.069 
little bit now my clay is in the cutter
I<00:03:16.470> take<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.579> over<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> sheet<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.810> clay

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
I take this over I have a sheet of clay

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.349 
I take this over I have a sheet of clay
that<00:03:19.709> I've<00:03:19.859> taken<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.340> bamboo<00:03:20.700> skewer<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.239> made

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
that I've taken a bamboo skewer and made

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.120 
that I've taken a bamboo skewer and made
a<00:03:21.389> channel<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:22.139> going<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:23.099> our

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
a channel that's going to be for our

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.690 
a channel that's going to be for our
bead<00:03:23.430> hole<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.510> put<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.109> here<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
bead hole and I put this on here and

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.930 
bead hole and I put this on here and
punch<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.910> through<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> don't<00:03:28.079> have<00:03:28.470> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
punch it through so you don't have to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.930 
punch it through so you don't have to
bake<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.090> with<00:03:30.209> anything<00:03:30.419> inside<00:03:30.840> no<00:03:31.940> all

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
bake it with anything inside no all

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.490 
bake it with anything inside no all
right<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.510> once<00:03:33.750> your<00:03:33.870> two<00:03:34.019> pieces<00:03:34.349> are

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
right so once your two pieces are

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.259 
right so once your two pieces are
together<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:35.459> would<00:03:35.609> be<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.819> channel<00:03:36.030> that

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
together that would be the channel that

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.089 
together that would be the channel that
your<00:03:36.389> beading<00:03:36.660> wire<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:37.139> stretching<00:03:37.500> exactly

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
your beading wire is stretching exactly

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.460 
your beading wire is stretching exactly
once<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.549> exactly<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:39.959> can<00:03:40.169> clear<00:03:40.440> your

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
once you exactly and you can clear your

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.409 
once you exactly and you can clear your
hole<00:03:40.859> if<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.040> need<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.489> once<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.329> it

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
hole if you need to once you get it

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.809 
hole if you need to once you get it
punched<00:03:42.750> through<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:43.739> see<00:03:43.919> my<00:03:44.069> hole<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.340> nice

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
punched through but see my hole is nice

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.879 
punched through but see my hole is nice
there<00:03:45.299> right<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.079> don't<00:03:46.139> have<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.709> worry

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
there right and I don't have to worry

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.379 
there right and I don't have to worry
about<00:03:46.950> trying<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.549> drill<00:03:47.880> through<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
about trying to drill through and

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.390 
about trying to drill through and
possibly<00:03:48.660> damaging<00:03:49.500> my<00:03:49.650> source<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:50.010> great<00:03:50.160> idea

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
possibly damaging my source a great idea

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.680 
possibly damaging my source a great idea
I<00:03:50.459> never<00:03:50.579> thought<00:03:50.819> about<00:03:50.880> making<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.359> channel

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
I never thought about making a channel

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.300 
I never thought about making a channel
like<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.989> yeah<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.590> works<00:03:52.799> really<00:03:53.010> nicely

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
like that yeah it works really nicely

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.979 
like that yeah it works really nicely
especially<00:03:54.090> because<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.419> gives<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> bigger

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
especially because it gives you a bigger

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
especially because it gives you a bigger
channel<00:03:55.349> for<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> elastic<00:03:55.859> right<00:03:56.849> so<00:03:57.150> now

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
channel for the elastic right so now

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.400 
channel for the elastic right so now
you're<00:03:57.419> ready<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.629> bake<00:03:57.870> this<00:03:58.079> Pete<00:03:58.290> you're

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.259 
also like to get the little creases in
the<00:04:20.039> clay<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.280> think<00:04:20.700> that's<00:04:20.849> much<00:04:21.060> more

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269

natural-looking<00:04:21.890> this<00:04:22.890> piece<00:04:23.159> here<00:04:23.490> I've

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
natural-looking this piece here I've

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
at a white to the clay to make it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.659 
at a white to the clay to make it
lighter<00:04:26.139> and<00:04:26.289> a<00:04:26.470> little<00:04:26.740> bit<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.039> stone<00:04:27.370> to

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
lighter and a little bit of the stone to

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.100 
lighter and a little bit of the stone to
give<00:04:27.819> us<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.030> little<00:04:28.180> bit<00:04:28.360> different<00:04:28.539> texture

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110

and take your blade and chop those into

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.860 
and take your blade and chop those into
pieces<00:04:41.819> so<00:04:42.819> again<00:04:43.060> you're<00:04:43.240> randomly<00:04:43.690> just

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
pieces so again you're randomly just

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.170 
pieces so again you're randomly just
chopping<00:04:44.259> this<00:04:44.380> up<00:04:44.560> just<00:04:44.830> randomly<00:04:45.729> chopping

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
it up and you take those pieces and

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.270 
it up and you take those pieces and
gather<00:04:50.110> them<00:04:50.349> up<00:04:50.470> in<00:04:50.590> your<00:04:50.740> hand

gather them up in your hand
push<00:04:52.180> them<00:04:52.330> together<00:04:52.479> don't<00:04:53.020> roll<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.410> because

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
push them together don't roll it because

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.499 
push them together don't roll it because
you<00:04:53.949> don't<00:04:54.009> want<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.340> get<00:04:54.430> too<00:04:54.669> smooth<00:04:55.000> okay

you don't want it to get too smooth okay

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.059 
you don't want it to get too smooth okay
and<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.780> will<00:04:55.930> make<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.110> nugget<00:04:56.380> for<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.719 
then what I would do is my boys were
little<00:04:59.050> I'd<00:04:59.409> give<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.069> them<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.370> they<00:05:00.490> take

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
little I'd give it to them and they take

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.580 
little I'd give it to them and they take
it<00:05:00.849> out<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.060> roll<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.389> in<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.509> dirt<00:05:01.810> for<00:05:02.229> me<00:05:02.409> to
