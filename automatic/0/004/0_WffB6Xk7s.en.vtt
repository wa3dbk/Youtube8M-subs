00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
encouraged significant additional

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.750 
encouraged significant additional
expenses<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.620> I've<00:02:11.740> made<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.130> clear<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
expenses and I've made it clear to the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.930

trade<00:02:13.000> union<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.290> an<00:02:15.130> expense<00:02:15.670> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
trade union but that is an expense that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.360 
trade union but that is an expense that
must<00:02:16.330> be<00:02:16.480> recovered<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.380> financial<00:02:18.010> value

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
must be recovered so the financial value

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.000 
must be recovered so the financial value
of<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.000> proposal<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.990> we<00:02:20.140> had<00:02:20.320> tables<00:02:20.770> is
