00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 I'll help but anyway. 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.710
 First of all, I want to thank the mouth. 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.139
 of the river were already others that have had here 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.480
 principal at the end of the year and 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.309
 Everywhere in Brazil and from the first 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.129
 day until the last minute 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.380
 It was all us giving blood loading. 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.190
 A problem in Brazil, not two. 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.680
 phases 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.980
 thanked the population of sÃ£o miguel 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.720
 which supported with food that gave the greatest 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.719
 and that this serves as an example of this 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.120
 it was only a truce the war did not end 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.510
 It's just begun that the government will take 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.280
 message that the people have the strength and the battle 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.079
 It's going to continue, this is just a truce. 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.600
 because we do not want here that the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.609
 population leaving lack of food for 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.609
 a farmer stover 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.160
 looks a certain way was achieved is gives 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.680
 to say something this was 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.989
 achieved but the main one to show 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 that the people have strength and that the people are 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.240
 united that the people are not bandit was the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.670
 federal government 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.130
 see that police reinforcement police 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.010
 for me to open here that did not give a problem 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.290
 some police were needed at some point 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.360
 while drugs enter the border 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.460
 and there is no policing but here it is 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.310
 honest people who only know how to work 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.070
 with the government send the policing to 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.720
 me the manifesto was his mansion in the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.820
 police operation here today 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.280
 the civil police played the part of him and he 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.229
 Thank you I want patient because I 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.600
 says the first day was not in time 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.060
 Someone had a problem with the whole police. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.520
 world here is father everybody is there 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.860
 family everyone is human 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.560
 The only problem is the government that he 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.560
 treats the person who is in the worst 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.990
 possible the problem of government is not in the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 classes in the police the problem is government 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.610
 that's why 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.880
 the best way is on the day of the vote to take 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.979
 this shameless bastard when the power 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.590
 diesel oil is the transpose request 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.080
 reducing the trapped group was not met 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.230
 this request that was lacking in order to 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.459
 world number 1 tool 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.769
 The oil is there its hard to say is 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.010
 difficult to say but they have 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.530
 day 10 the government asked and we will go 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 to be the least gay got in the fight is with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.000
 the whole staff of the committee 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.489

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:41.040
