changed on this MacBook Air and a couple

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.010 
changed on this MacBook Air and a couple
of<00:00:36.690> them<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.559> new<00:00:37.770> USB<00:00:38.309> 3.0<00:00:39.210> ports<00:00:39.629> that

means you'll be able to use 3.0 devices

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
means you'll be able to use 3.0 devices
such<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.510> new<00:00:48.719> hard<00:00:49.020> drives<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.770> flash

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
such as like new hard drives or flash

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.689 
such as like new hard drives or flash
drives<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.260> this<00:00:52.260> computer<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> you'll<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
drives with this computer and you'll be

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.729 
drives with this computer and you'll be
able<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.059> faster<00:00:54.539> data<00:00:54.809> transfer<00:00:55.379> speeds

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
able to do faster data transfer speeds

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.099 
able to do faster data transfer speeds
pretty<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.480> move<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.809> files

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
pretty much like you can move your files

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
pretty much like you can move your files
between<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.739> computer<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> device<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
between the computer and the device a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.280 
between the computer and the device a
lot<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:00.960> faster<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:03.629> second<00:01:04.049> change

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
lot a lot faster now the second change

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.850 
lot a lot faster now the second change
is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.309> new<00:01:05.549> MagSafe<00:01:06.180> connector<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
is the new MagSafe connector so here we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 
is the new MagSafe connector so here we
have<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> new<00:01:08.369> MacBook<00:01:08.909> Air<00:01:09.500> max<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> charger

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
have the new MacBook Air max a charger

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
have the new MacBook Air max a charger
and<00:01:11.689> I<00:01:12.689> believe<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> MacBook<00:01:13.530> Pro<00:01:13.740> uses<00:01:14.130> this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and I believe the MacBook Pro uses this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.210 
and I believe the MacBook Pro uses this
as<00:01:14.490> well<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.290> here<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> compared

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
as well and here you can see it compared

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.490 
as well and here you can see it compared
to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> old<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:19.020> they're<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> bit

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
to the old one so they're a bit

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
to the old one so they're a bit
different<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.460> new<00:01:20.610> ones<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.090> flatter<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
different the new ones a bit flatter and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.810 
different the new ones a bit flatter and
wider<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> means<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.640> you've<00:01:23.790> had

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
wider so that means that if you've had

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.570 
wider so that means that if you've had
an<00:01:24.150> old<00:01:24.360> MacBook<00:01:24.659> Pro<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.439> MacBook<00:01:26.159> Air<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
an old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.719 
an old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air and
you<00:01:27.119> still<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> chargers<00:01:28.610> chances<00:01:29.610> are

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you still have the chargers chances are

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
you still have the chargers chances are
you<00:01:29.820> won't<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.119> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> use<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
you won't be able to use these as a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.560 
you won't be able to use these as a
replacement<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.340> anything<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> new<00:01:33.360> Mac

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

here I'm video chatting with my

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.940 
here I'm video chatting with my
girlfriend<00:01:44.700> wah<00:01:45.030> she<00:01:45.090> eats<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.479> apple<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.679 
can see the clarity is pretty nice on
there<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.700> definitely<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:51.600> who

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
there so I definitely think people who

are video chatting and things like that
will<00:01:54.030> definitely<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.630> happy<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
will definitely be happy with the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.480 
will definitely be happy with the
quality<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.740> they'll<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.040> getting<00:01:56.340> with

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
quality that they'll be getting with

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
quality that they'll be getting with
this<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:57.540> enough<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> changes<00:01:58.619> let's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
this now enough about the changes let's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
this now enough about the changes let's
talk<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> bit<00:01:59.399> about<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.909> performance<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
talk a bit about the performance of the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.620 
talk a bit about the performance of the
actual<00:02:01.530> MacBook<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.030> thing<00:02:03.240> has<00:02:03.360> wowed

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
actual MacBook now this thing has wowed

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
actual MacBook now this thing has wowed
me<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.990> far<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.320> performance<00:02:04.890> goes<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.820> one

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
me as far as performance goes it's one

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.910 
me as far as performance goes it's one
of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> fastest<00:02:06.689> computers<00:02:07.110> I've<00:02:07.259> ever<00:02:07.530> used

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of the fastest computers I've ever used

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.029 
of the fastest computers I've ever used
ever<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.989> really<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.530> has<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> lot

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
ever and I really think that has a lot

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.370 
ever and I really think that has a lot
to<00:02:11.069> do<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.910> solid-state<00:02:12.330> drive

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to do with the solid-state drive

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.970 
to do with the solid-state drive
now<00:02:13.850> that's<00:02:14.850> also<00:02:15.240> called<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.600> SSD<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.470> short

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
now that's also called the SSD for short

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
now that's also called the SSD for short
but<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> solid-state<00:02:18.210> drive<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.930> basically

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
but the solid-state drive is basically

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.340 
but the solid-state drive is basically
your<00:02:19.680> hard<00:02:19.920> drive<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.490> your<00:02:21.270> storage<00:02:21.780> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
your hard drive and your storage so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.410 
your hard drive and your storage so
where<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> place<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.860> photos<00:02:23.430> your<00:02:23.850> music

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
where you place your photos your music

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.140 
where you place your photos your music
videos<00:02:24.960> all<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.470> kind<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.800> stuff<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:27.090> is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
videos all that kind of stuff this is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.610 
videos all that kind of stuff this is
where<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.510> placed<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.440> your

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
where it's placed so it's just like your

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.460 
where it's placed so it's just like your
hard<00:02:28.860> drive<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.540> main<00:02:30.720> difference<00:02:31.260> is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
hard drive and the main difference is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.440 
hard drive and the main difference is
the<00:02:31.740> way<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.070> they're<00:02:32.220> built<00:02:32.520> your<00:02:33.180> typical

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the way that they're built your typical

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.490 
the way that they're built your typical
hard<00:02:33.900> drive<00:02:34.140> has<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.600> mechanical<00:02:36.600> it's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
hard drive has like a mechanical it's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.320 
hard drive has like a mechanical it's
like<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.710> mechanical<00:02:38.220> piece<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.460> machinery<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
like a mechanical piece of machinery and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.020 
like a mechanical piece of machinery and
it<00:02:40.260> has<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.650> spinning<00:02:41.040> disk<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.670> reads

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it has like a spinning disk that reads

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.100 
it has like a spinning disk that reads
the<00:02:42.270> data<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.920> there<00:02:44.190> so

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
the data that you have on there so

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.030 
the data that you have on there so
usually<00:02:46.110> when<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> hear<00:02:46.500> your<00:02:46.680> computer

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
usually when you hear your computer

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670 
usually when you hear your computer
humming<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.700> feel<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.090> humming<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.380> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
humming or you feel it humming it's the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.320 
humming or you feel it humming it's the
hard<00:02:49.860> drive<00:02:50.070> spinning<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.760> also<00:02:50.880> could<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
hard drive spinning it also could be the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.510 
hard drive spinning it also could be the
fans<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.440> humming<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.010> usually<00:02:53.370> from

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
fans but that humming is usually from

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.600 
fans but that humming is usually from
the<00:02:53.580> hard<00:02:53.880> drive<00:02:54.000> spinning<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:55.440> with<00:02:56.340> this

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the hard drive spinning but with this

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.540 
the hard drive spinning but with this
they're<00:02:57.510> built<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.590> hard<00:02:58.980> drive<00:02:59.130> space<00:02:59.280> is

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
they're built the hard drive space is

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.110 
they're built the hard drive space is
actually<00:02:59.730> made<00:03:00.210> with<00:03:00.500> flash<00:03:01.500> memory<00:03:02.040> chips<00:03:02.400> so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
actually made with flash memory chips so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400 
actually made with flash memory chips so
their<00:03:03.270> little<00:03:03.450> memory<00:03:03.840> chips<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.320> are

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
their little memory chips that are

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.820 
their little memory chips that are
placed<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.720> insides<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.990> computer

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
placed on the insides of the computer

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.250 
placed on the insides of the computer
and<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> lot<00:03:09.240> better<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.630> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and this is a lot better because that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.710 
and this is a lot better because that
means<00:03:10.470> there's<00:03:10.740> no<00:03:11.010> mechanical<00:03:11.820> or<00:03:12.270> spinning

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
means there's no mechanical or spinning

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
means there's no mechanical or spinning
parts<00:03:13.140> inside<00:03:13.980> which<00:03:14.520> makes<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.910> lot<00:03:15.060> safer

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
parts inside which makes it a lot safer

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.180 
parts inside which makes it a lot safer
so<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.350> means<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.680> move<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.070> around

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
so that means you can move this around

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.630 
so that means you can move this around
and<00:03:17.850> not<00:03:18.630> really<00:03:18.930> worry<00:03:19.170> about<00:03:19.560> messing<00:03:20.340> up

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
and not really worry about messing up

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.340 
and not really worry about messing up
anything<00:03:20.940> now

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
anything now

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.130 
anything now
what's<00:03:23.220> also<00:03:23.490> great<00:03:23.880> about<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
what's also great about this is that it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
what's also great about this is that it
increases<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.830> speed<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.400> your<00:03:26.430> computer

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
increases the speed of your computer

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.350 
increases the speed of your computer
drastically<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.700> think<00:03:29.940> that's<00:03:30.120> really

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
drastically and I think that's really

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.110 
drastically and I think that's really
what<00:03:30.570> makes<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.020> one<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.500> fast<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.730> open

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
what makes this one so fast I can open

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.200 
what makes this one so fast I can open
up<00:03:33.270> I<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:34.350> open<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.850> application<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
up I can open a application here and it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.640 
up I can open a application here and it
opens<00:03:36.510> almost<00:03:36.780> instantly

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
opens almost instantly

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.320 
opens almost instantly
whereas<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> hard<00:03:38.460> drive<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.060> take<00:03:39.210> a<00:03:39.240> bit

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
whereas a hard drive it will take a bit

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.150 
whereas a hard drive it will take a bit
longer<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.500> definitely<00:03:40.650> see<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
longer and I can definitely see the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.250 
longer and I can definitely see the
difference<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:42.000> using<00:03:42.300> my<00:03:42.480> macbook<00:03:43.050> air

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
difference in using my macbook air

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.430 
difference in using my macbook air
compared<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.040> my<00:03:44.250> macbook<00:03:44.700> pro<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.870> my<00:03:46.080> macbook

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
compared to my macbook pro as my macbook

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.980 
compared to my macbook pro as my macbook
pro<00:03:46.470> has<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:46.800> regular<00:03:47.280> standard<00:03:47.730> um<00:03:48.000> hard<00:03:48.750> drive

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
pro has a regular standard um hard drive

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.860 
pro has a regular standard um hard drive
and<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:50.070> definitely<00:03:50.610> takes<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.910> lot<00:03:51.060> longer<00:03:51.300> to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
and it definitely takes a lot longer to

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.630 
and it definitely takes a lot longer to
open<00:03:51.900> up<00:03:53.090> applications<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.530> files<00:03:55.640> so

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
open up applications and files so

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.190 
open up applications and files so
there's<00:03:56.910> definitely<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.510> big<00:03:57.780> difference

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
there's definitely a big difference

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.020 
there's definitely a big difference
there<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.500> I'm<00:03:58.830> able<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.280> see<00:03:59.490> it<00:03:59.580> between<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
there and I'm able to see it between the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.960 
there and I'm able to see it between the
two<00:04:00.240> and<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:01.170> funny<00:04:01.380> because<00:04:01.520> my<00:04:02.520> macbook

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
two and it's funny because my macbook

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.750 
two and it's funny because my macbook
pro<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.360> actually<00:04:03.900> actually<00:04:04.740> has<00:04:05.130> much<00:04:05.550> better

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
pro is actually actually has much better

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.780 
pro is actually actually has much better
specs<00:04:06.350> than<00:04:07.350> my<00:04:07.650> macbook<00:04:08.100> air<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
specs than my macbook air but the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.220 
specs than my macbook air but the
solid-state<00:04:09.240> drive<00:04:09.480> makes<00:04:09.810> all<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
solid-state drive makes all the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.070 
solid-state drive makes all the
difference<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:11.880> definitely<00:04:12.360> think<00:04:12.840> a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
difference so I definitely think a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.770 
difference so I definitely think a
solid-state<00:04:13.770> drive<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.220> what<00:04:15.030> pushes<00:04:15.270> this<00:04:15.540> to

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
solid-state drive is what pushes this to

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.190 
solid-state drive is what pushes this to
be<00:04:15.900> as<00:04:15.990> great<00:04:16.200> as<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:18.049> just<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.140> you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
be as great as it is and just so you

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.950 
be as great as it is and just so you
guys<00:04:19.320> know<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.890> saw<00:04:20.070> state<00:04:20.340> drive<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.970> similar

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
guys know the saw state drive is similar

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.500 
guys know the saw state drive is similar
to<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.490> things<00:04:23.700> inside<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.210> your

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
to that of the things inside of your

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.650 
to that of the things inside of your
smartphones<00:04:25.140> like

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
smartphones like

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.770 
smartphones like
in<00:04:25.990> your<00:04:26.110> smartphone's<00:04:26.620> SD<00:04:27.280> cards<00:04:27.850> anything

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
in your smartphone's SD cards anything

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.160 
in your smartphone's SD cards anything
portable<00:04:29.590> really<00:04:29.920> it<00:04:30.130> uses<00:04:30.580> flash<00:04:30.910> memory<00:04:31.360> not

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
portable really it uses flash memory not

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.960 
portable really it uses flash memory not
really<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.680> regular<00:04:33.040> hard<00:04:33.280> drives<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.790> you

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
really the regular hard drives that you

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.050 
really the regular hard drives that you
are<00:04:34.800> typically<00:04:35.800> finding<00:04:36.190> computers<00:04:36.730> or

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
are typically finding computers or

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.900 
are typically finding computers or
external<00:04:37.960> portable<00:04:38.320> hard<00:04:38.500> drives<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.670> it's

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
external portable hard drives so it's

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.080 
external portable hard drives so it's
similar<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:42.460> really<00:04:42.700> makes<00:04:42.910> this

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
similar to that and it really makes this

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.600 
similar to that and it really makes this
great<00:04:43.450> for<00:04:43.780> traveling<00:04:44.740> because<00:04:45.220> like<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.550> said

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
great for traveling because like I said

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.310 
great for traveling because like I said
before<00:04:45.730> you<00:04:46.300> can<00:04:46.420> move<00:04:46.600> this<00:04:46.720> around<00:04:46.900> without

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
before you can move this around without

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.740 
before you can move this around without
worrying<00:04:47.710> about<00:04:47.830> any<00:04:48.250> pieces<00:04:48.750> malfunctioning

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
worrying about any pieces malfunctioning

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.050 
worrying about any pieces malfunctioning
and<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.650> just<00:04:50.800> really<00:04:50.950> makes<00:04:51.220> this<00:04:51.370> great<00:04:51.730> for

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
and it just really makes this great for

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.510 
and it just really makes this great for
someone<00:04:52.510> who's<00:04:52.750> traveling<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.320> lot<00:04:53.500> or<00:04:53.770> moving

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
someone who's traveling a lot or moving

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.040 
someone who's traveling a lot or moving
from<00:04:54.550> room<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.120> room<00:04:55.180> all<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.570> time

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
from room to room all the time

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.750 
from room to room all the time
so<00:04:56.440> this<00:04:56.740> definitely<00:04:57.190> helps<00:04:57.430> with<00:04:57.640> the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
so this definitely helps with the

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.120 
so this definitely helps with the
portability<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.600> MacBook<00:04:58.990> Air<00:04:59.020> so<00:04:59.950> for

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
portability of the MacBook Air so for

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.290 
portability of the MacBook Air so for

definitely gonna be good for you at the
base<00:05:13.000> model<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.720> don't<00:05:13.780> think<00:05:14.230> you<00:05:14.350> have<00:05:14.530> to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
base model I don't think you have to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.620 
base model I don't think you have to
upgrade<00:05:14.890> anything<00:05:15.550> if<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.240> don't<00:05:16.420> plan<00:05:16.600> on

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
upgrade anything if you don't plan on

upgrade anything if you don't plan on
doing<00:05:16.930> any<00:05:17.230> using<00:05:18.160> any<00:05:18.310> really<00:05:18.640> heavy

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
doing any using any really heavy

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.330 
doing any using any really heavy
programming<00:05:19.660> like<00:05:19.930> on<00:05:20.140> video<00:05:20.650> editing<00:05:20.860> or

Photoshop and things of that nature like

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.850 
Photoshop and things of that nature like
those<00:05:27.700> heavy<00:05:27.910> programs<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.570> would<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.320> would

suggest<00:05:30.040> upgrading<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.060> RAM<00:05:31.090> from<00:05:31.720> four

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
suggest upgrading the RAM from four

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.810 
suggest upgrading the RAM from four
gigabytes<00:05:32.530> from<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.980> base<00:05:33.130> model<00:05:33.550> to<00:05:33.640> eight

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
gigabytes from the base model to eight

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.570 
gigabytes from the base model to eight
gigabytes<00:05:34.360> because<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.980> thing<00:05:36.190> about<00:05:36.430> the

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
gigabytes because the thing about the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.850 
gigabytes because the thing about the
air<00:05:36.760> is<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.870> once<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.230> get<00:05:38.500> once<00:05:38.800> you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
air is that once you get once you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.680 
air is that once you get once you
purchase<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.400> there's<00:05:39.640> no<00:05:39.790> going<00:05:39.970> back<00:05:40.150> you

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
purchase it there's no going back you

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
able to do that much better than my

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.850 
able to do that much better than my
macbook<00:06:24.520> pro<00:06:24.550> actually<00:06:25.330> but<00:06:26.169> it<00:06:26.470> doesn't

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
macbook pro actually but it doesn't

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.440 
macbook pro actually but it doesn't
leave<00:06:26.950> much<00:06:27.220> space<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:27.760> do<00:06:27.910> anything<00:06:28.120> else

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.050 
leave much space to do anything else
because<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.140> lack<00:06:29.410> of<00:06:29.440> RAM<00:06:29.830> but<00:06:30.130> I've<00:06:30.850> been

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
because the lack of RAM but I've been

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.330 
because the lack of RAM but I've been
able<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.330> use<00:06:31.510> it<00:06:31.720> really<00:06:31.870> quickly<00:06:32.340> faster

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
able to use it really quickly faster

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.310 
able to use it really quickly faster
than<00:06:33.460> my<00:06:33.520> macbook<00:06:33.850> pro<00:06:33.960> primarily<00:06:34.960> because<00:06:35.140> of

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
than my macbook pro primarily because of

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.960 
than my macbook pro primarily because of
the<00:06:35.500> solid-state<00:06:35.950> drives<00:06:36.310> being<00:06:36.640> able<00:06:36.850> to

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
the solid-state drives being able to

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.659 
the solid-state drives being able to
read<00:06:37.210> all<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.539> files<00:06:37.870> that<00:06:38.110> I'm<00:06:38.200> using

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
read all the files that I'm using

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.020 
read all the files that I'm using
at<00:06:39.180> once<00:06:39.629> pretty<00:06:40.169> quickly<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:41.370> I<00:06:41.789> definitely

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
at once pretty quickly so I definitely

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.989 
at once pretty quickly so I definitely
think<00:06:42.270> it's<00:06:42.509> doable<00:06:42.870> I'm<00:06:43.259> doing<00:06:43.650> it<00:06:43.800> myself

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:43.999 
think it's doable I'm doing it myself

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.700 
think it's doable I'm doing it myself
but<00:06:44.999> had<00:06:45.419> I<00:06:45.449> known<00:06:45.749> that<00:06:45.780> I<00:06:46.080> wouldn't<00:06:46.379> be<00:06:46.560> able

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
but had I known that I wouldn't be able

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.670 
but had I known that I wouldn't be able
to<00:06:46.979> upgrade<00:06:47.490> any<00:06:47.759> of<00:06:47.879> the<00:06:48.060> parts<00:06:48.930> I<00:06:49.169> would<00:06:49.590> have

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
to upgrade any of the parts I would have

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.559 
to upgrade any of the parts I would have
opted<00:06:50.039> for<00:06:50.189> the<00:06:50.340> aging<00:06:50.669> Ram<00:06:50.879> version<00:06:51.389> and

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
opted for the aging Ram version and

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.390 
opted for the aging Ram version and
pretty<00:06:52.110> much<00:06:52.259> that<00:06:52.319> wraps<00:06:52.650> up<00:06:52.830> my<00:06:52.979> review<00:06:53.009> of
