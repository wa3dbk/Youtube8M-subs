those<00:02:42.840> primary<00:02:43.320> feathers<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.800> spread<00:02:44.160> across

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
those primary feathers are spread across

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.570 
those primary feathers are spread across
the<00:02:44.610> back<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.480> he<00:02:45.600> lunges<00:02:46.020> forward<00:02:46.290> he

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the back and as he lunges forward he

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.949 
the back and as he lunges forward he
closes<00:02:47.580> those<00:02:47.760> wings<00:02:48.030> across<00:02:48.420> his<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
closes those wings across his back and

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.780 
closes those wings across his back and
somewhere<00:02:49.739> they're<00:02:49.920> either<00:02:50.280> between<00:02:50.520> the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
somewhere they're either between the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.310 
somewhere they're either between the
feathers<00:02:51.150> rubbing<00:02:51.480> against<00:02:51.720> themselves<00:02:52.230> or

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
feathers rubbing against themselves or

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600 
feathers rubbing against themselves or
perhaps<00:02:52.470> against<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.040> base<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.430> tail

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
perhaps against the base of the tail

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
perhaps against the base of the tail
that's<00:02:54.150> where<00:02:54.360> he's<00:02:54.480> creating<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.050> non

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that's where he's creating that non

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.050 
that's where he's creating that non
vocal<00:02:55.950> sound<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.370> now<00:02:59.520> we're<00:02:59.670> looking<00:02:59.880> at<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
vocal sound so now we're looking at the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.449 
vocal sound so now we're looking at the
male<00:03:00.239> magnificent<00:03:00.810> rifle<00:03:01.080> bird<00:03:01.230> he<00:03:02.130> makes<00:03:02.340> his

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
male magnificent rifle bird he makes his

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.160 
male magnificent rifle bird he makes his
non<00:03:02.640> vocal<00:03:03.000> Sal<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.420> courtship<00:03:03.840> display

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
non vocal Sal in courtship display

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.229 
non vocal Sal in courtship display
somewhat<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.220> black<00:03:05.370> sickle<00:03:05.700> bill<00:03:05.850> but

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
somewhat like the black sickle bill but

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.560 
somewhat like the black sickle bill but
he<00:03:06.270> does<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.780> very<00:03:06.930> different<00:03:06.959> way<00:03:11.570> as

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
he does it in a very different way as

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.449 
he does it in a very different way as
you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.750> see<00:03:12.989> he's<00:03:13.140> opening<00:03:13.799> his<00:03:13.860> wigs<00:03:14.160> up

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you can see he's opening his wigs up

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.340 
you can see he's opening his wigs up
he's<00:03:14.940> moving<00:03:15.510> his<00:03:15.600> head<00:03:15.780> from<00:03:15.930> side<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> side

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
he's moving his head from side to side

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.810 
he's moving his head from side to side
when<00:03:16.709> he's<00:03:16.890> doing<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.160> he's<00:03:17.370> moving<00:03:17.730> his

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
when he's doing that he's moving his

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.390 
when he's doing that he's moving his
wings<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:19.049> sound<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.650> hear<00:03:19.980> is

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
wings and that sound that you hear is

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.160 
wings and that sound that you hear is
being<00:03:20.700> produced<00:03:20.970> by<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> opening<00:03:22.019> and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
being produced by the opening and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.630 
being produced by the opening and
closing<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.680> wings<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.160> sounds<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.610> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
closing of the wings it sounds like a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.310 
closing of the wings it sounds like a
pronounced<00:03:24.570> rustling

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.540 

another<00:03:32.320> really<00:03:32.710> cool<00:03:32.890> aspect<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.490> this

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
another really cool aspect of this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.300 
another really cool aspect of this
non-vocal<00:03:34.090> sound<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:35.200> how<00:03:35.410> directional<00:03:36.220> it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
non-vocal sound is how directional it

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.280 
non-vocal sound is how directional it
seems<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:36.670> be<00:03:37.950> notice<00:03:38.950> when<00:03:39.070> he<00:03:39.130> turns<00:03:39.520> around

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
seems to be notice when he turns around

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.230 
seems to be notice when he turns around
the<00:03:41.290> sound<00:03:41.560> gets<00:03:41.770> louder<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.850> that's<00:03:42.970> because

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
the sound gets louder and that's because

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.600 
the sound gets louder and that's because
he's<00:03:43.390> directing<00:03:43.960> that<00:03:44.080> sound<00:03:44.490> towards<00:03:45.490> the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
he's directing that sound towards the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.880 
he's directing that sound towards the
female<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.300> in<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.720> case<00:03:46.960> it<00:03:47.260> also<00:03:47.470> happens

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
female and in this case it also happens

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.280 
female and in this case it also happens
to<00:03:47.950> be<00:03:48.040> directed<00:03:48.910> towards<00:03:49.120> our<00:03:49.180> microphone<00:03:49.720> so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
to be directed towards our microphone so

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.120 
to be directed towards our microphone so
it's<00:03:50.440> picking<00:03:50.590> up<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.890> sound<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.460> well

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.470 

although<00:03:57.130> there's<00:03:57.400> never<00:03:57.520> been<00:03:57.640> any<00:03:57.910> good

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
although there's never been any good

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.840 
although there's never been any good
research<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.260> it's<00:03:59.740> possible<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
research on this it's possible that the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.610 
research on this it's possible that the
shape<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.180> his<00:04:01.330> wings<00:04:01.570> would<00:04:02.230> have<00:04:02.380> something

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
shape of his wings would have something

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.860 
shape of his wings would have something
to<00:04:02.740> do<00:04:02.980> with<00:04:03.030> projecting<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.150> sound<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
to do with projecting that sound in the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.200 
to do with projecting that sound in the
direction<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.380> where<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> female<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.220> almost

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
direction of where the female is almost

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.420 
direction of where the female is almost
like<00:04:07.420> it's<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.780> an<00:04:07.960> amplifier<00:04:08.950> or<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.400> a

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
like it's a an amplifier or like a

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.730 
like it's a an amplifier or like a
megaphone<00:04:09.790> what's<00:04:10.750> cool<00:04:10.960> is<00:04:10.990> is<00:04:11.380> when<00:04:11.650> we

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
megaphone what's cool is is when we

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.770 
megaphone what's cool is is when we
think<00:04:11.890> back<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.250> black<00:04:12.520> sickle<00:04:12.850> bill<00:04:13.000> he

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
think back to the black sickle bill he

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.560 
think back to the black sickle bill he
also<00:04:13.990> seems<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.950> have<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.340> curved<00:04:16.060> kind<00:04:16.480> of

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
also seems to have this curved kind of

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.660 
also seems to have this curved kind of
megaphone<00:04:17.049> aspect<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.130> his<00:04:18.280> courtship

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
megaphone aspect to his courtship

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.510 
megaphone aspect to his courtship
display<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:22.110> we<00:04:23.110> know<00:04:23.230> that<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.530> female<00:04:23.740> just

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
display and we know that the female just

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.370 
display and we know that the female just
like<00:04:24.640> on<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.850> magnificent<00:04:25.300> rifle<00:04:25.600> bird<00:04:25.720> she

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
like on the magnificent rifle bird she

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.200 
like on the magnificent rifle bird she
also<00:04:26.560> sits<00:04:26.980> right<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.640> front<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.030> male

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
also sits right in front of the male

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.720 
also sits right in front of the male
when<00:04:28.390> he<00:04:28.510> makes<00:04:28.690> his<00:04:28.810> knocking<00:04:29.290> sound<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.610> it's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
when he makes his knocking sound so it's

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.270 
when he makes his knocking sound so it's
possible<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.390> both<00:04:32.200> of<00:04:32.230> these<00:04:32.500> species<00:04:32.770> have

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
possible that both of these species have

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.360 
possible that both of these species have
this<00:04:33.790> directional<00:04:34.720> element<00:04:35.280> directing<00:04:36.280> that

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
this directional element directing that

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.190 
this directional element directing that
non<00:04:36.550> vocal<00:04:36.940> sound<00:04:37.210> right<00:04:37.720> where<00:04:37.870> they<00:04:37.960> want<00:04:38.140> it

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
non vocal sound right where they want it

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.990 
non vocal sound right where they want it
to<00:04:38.290> be<00:04:38.440> where<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> female<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.610> when<00:04:39.820> she's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
to be where the female is when she's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.180 
to be where the female is when she's
watching<00:04:40.240> their<00:04:40.540> courtship<00:04:40.870> displays

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.190 

clearly<00:04:45.190> both<00:04:45.370> these<00:04:45.610> species<00:04:45.820> have

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
clearly both these species have

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.400 
clearly both these species have
extraordinary<00:04:47.200> vocal<00:04:47.919> sounds<00:04:52.260> but<00:04:53.260> it's

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
extraordinary vocal sounds but it's
