which was a originally developed by NASA
I<00:02:53.660> was<00:02:53.810> put<00:02:54.050> in<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.550> seats<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:55.850> the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
I was put in the seats of the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000 
I was put in the seats of the
spacecraft's<00:02:58.300> it's<00:02:59.300> really<00:02:59.600> light<00:02:59.810> foam<00:03:00.140> it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
spacecraft's it's really light foam it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.070 
spacecraft's it's really light foam it
made<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.430> shoe<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:02.300> shoe<00:03:02.360> basically<00:03:02.900> weighs

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
made the shoe this shoe basically weighs

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.160 
made the shoe this shoe basically weighs
nothing<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.850> little<00:03:05.690> heavier<00:03:06.020> than

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
nothing it's it's a little heavier than

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.610 
nothing it's it's a little heavier than
the<00:03:06.320> nike<00:03:06.650> free<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.200> still<00:03:09.560> really

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the nike free but it's still really

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.600 
the nike free but it's still really
light<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.780> inside<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.410> inside<00:03:12.980> it

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
light and on the inside and inside it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.500 
light and on the inside and inside it
says<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.120> Nemec<00:03:15.050> support<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:16.030> don't<00:03:17.030> know<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
says I Nemec support I don't know you

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.970 
says I Nemec support I don't know you
can<00:03:17.690> see<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.019> it's<00:03:18.290> kind<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.769> light

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
can see that it's kind of light

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.940 
can see that it's kind of light
lettering<00:03:19.750> but<00:03:20.750> dynamic<00:03:21.019> support<00:03:21.620> is

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
lettering but dynamic support is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.600 
lettering but dynamic support is
basically<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.600> here's<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.170> lunar<00:03:24.470> foam<00:03:24.739> it's

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
basically so here's the lunar foam it's

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.060 
basically so here's the lunar foam it's
cut<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:26.060> on<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.360> inside<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:26.989> when<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.800> land

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
cut out on the inside so when you land

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.650 
cut out on the inside so when you land
it<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.430> spread<00:03:28.700> out<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.090> feel<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:29.510> it's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
it can spread out and feel like it's

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.970 
it can spread out and feel like it's
more<00:03:29.780> cushioned<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.630> yeah<00:03:33.560> there's<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.830> little

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
more cushioned so yeah there's a little

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.410 
more cushioned so yeah there's a little
foam<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.880> vault<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.760> what<00:03:37.760> it's<00:03:38.060> kind<00:03:38.330> of

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
foam in the vault so what it's kind of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.699 
foam in the vault so what it's kind of
like<00:03:38.570> slanted<00:03:39.320> at<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.650> at<00:03:40.299> an<00:03:41.299> angle<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.440> if

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
like slanted at it at an angle so if

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.300 
like slanted at it at an angle so if
you're<00:03:42.860> an<00:03:42.890> over<00:03:43.160> pronator<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.650> how

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
you're an over pronator it the this how

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.360 
you're an over pronator it the this how
outside<00:03:46.790> foam<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.180> harder<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:48.140> stops<00:03:49.130> your

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
outside foam is harder so it stops your

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.229 
outside foam is harder so it stops your
foot<00:03:50.000> from<00:03:50.090> rolling<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.690> as<00:03:50.900> much<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:52.549> yeah

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
foot from rolling in as much so yeah

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.910 
foot from rolling in as much so yeah
that's<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:54.200> nice<00:03:54.470> good<00:03:55.220> support<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.530> outsole

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
that's a nice good support the outsole

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.470 
that's a nice good support the outsole
is<00:03:58.420> orange<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.630> black<00:04:00.730> with<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:01.910> bolt<00:04:02.209> like

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
is orange and black with that bolt like

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.890 
is orange and black with that bolt like
I<00:04:02.600> showed<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:03.280> it's<00:04:04.280> nice<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.360> getting<00:04:05.660> on
