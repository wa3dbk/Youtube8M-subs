00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.990 
to find some cool things to talk about
and<00:02:26.230> then<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.590> go<00:02:26.710> do<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> show<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.370> then<00:02:27.880> we

and then we go do the show and then we
drive<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.390> next<00:02:28.600> town<00:02:28.750> stage<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.470> get

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
drive to the next town stage and you get

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.680 
drive to the next town stage and you get
the<00:02:29.650> bed<00:02:29.800> about<00:02:29.980> noon<00:02:30.220> midnight<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.850> over<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
the bed about noon midnight and over and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.360 
the bed about noon midnight and over and
over<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.900> over<00:02:31.960> again<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.590> fun<00:02:32.770> it's<00:02:33.010> fun<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
over and over again it's fun it's fun I

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.060 
over and over again it's fun it's fun I
think<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:34.000> lot<00:02:34.090> easier<00:02:34.300> than<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.780> racer<00:02:35.230> as

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
think it's a lot easier than a racer as

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.100 
think it's a lot easier than a racer as
you<00:02:36.220> can<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.520> behind<00:02:36.820> me<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.600> vehicle

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
you can see behind me in this vehicle

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.690 
you can see behind me in this vehicle
it's<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.380> hive<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.860> activity<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.460> that<00:02:39.550> is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's a hive of activity and that is

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's a hive of activity and that is
because<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.600> main<00:02:40.960> hub<00:02:41.260> which

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
because this is the main hub which

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.470 
because this is the main hub which
controls<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.310> lot<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.760> images<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.300> you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
controls a lot of the images that you

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.910 
controls a lot of the images that you
see<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.170> it's<00:02:44.350> actually<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.740> hosts

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
see so it's actually the hosts

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800 
see so it's actually the hosts
broadcasters<00:02:45.700> France<00:02:46.180> television<00:02:46.690> who

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
broadcasters France television who

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.540 
broadcasters France television who

briefly on the screens here now but the
people<00:02:54.280> within<00:02:54.610> this<00:02:54.760> vehicle<00:02:55.180> also<00:02:55.570> control

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
people within this vehicle also control

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.900 
people within this vehicle also control
a<00:02:56.080> lot<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.620> see<00:02:56.830> on<00:02:57.040> your<00:02:57.160> screen<00:02:57.610> so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
a lot that you see on your screen so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.640 
a lot that you see on your screen so
they<00:02:58.270> don't<00:02:58.450> control<00:02:58.720> exactly<00:02:59.050> what<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.470> live

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
they don't control exactly what the live

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.290 
they don't control exactly what the live
pictures<00:03:00.010> look<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:00.550> they<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.880> control

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
pictures look like but they can control

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.030
