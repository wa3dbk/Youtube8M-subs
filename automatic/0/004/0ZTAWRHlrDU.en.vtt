00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.900
 let's take a close look at the stories of the police vehicles accompanying 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.839
 Who lives in São Paulo? 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.579
 officially fails to recognize a military police vehicle 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.140
 It's but this look 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.060
 although they have popular 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 already had some variations of color and style 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.820
 see this example this well preserved car is a jeep willis year 1947 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.879
 with 4-cylinder petrol engine and 4por4 traction 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.660
 it was used by law enforcement in the 1950s for the transportation of 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 official 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.190
 different not 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.660
 but the change in vehicle image in the following years was even more 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.160
 significant 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.130
 in the 60's and 70's the cars won the colors orange solari black 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.070
 how can this be the fifth year 1976 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.980
 the ford model played in the special ostensible rounds and made the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.570
 policing and mobile tactical assistance as this summer 78 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.560
 equipped with six-cylinder petrol engines 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.729
 this summer is a bit younger than 1988 and was part of the 1st 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.960
 shock battalion 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.230
 so it has this different painting all in gray 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.040
 another automobile very used by the military police was the point is that the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.890
 here represented by one of the last ones incorporated into the fleet of pm 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.369
 This is the 1986 model. 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.930
 as a term of life to the people 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.900
 the gray and white painting was the standard of the time and the new logo of the vineyard 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.720
 stamped on the doors was a car outside the car 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 but exporting a car that was used in this type of policing 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200
 since the 1960s 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.390
 including civilian custody when it puts the operation into service 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 much easier then you bought this car on a large scale 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.799
 for several years 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.780
 is and after many years of total harmony with the freaks 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.090
 times changed and pm also felt the need for a car with four 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.419
 doors 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.419
 was when another car icon came on the scene 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.039
 for speaking 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.059
 and which represented a major evolution 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.479
 versatile brought porta ammo and carry hand console center 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.030
 beyond the portasetete 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.179
 right under your seat belt 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:41.919
 It could also transport prisoners or victims as 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:42.829
 be open 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.059
 the staff talk about reform in evolution was a door that probably had 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.349
 it was not only what justice is 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.769
 the United States today had with the division of the area that the person 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.449
 policing and would have more contact with the community then you 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.919
 I had more vehicles 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.649
 contact with the community in a smaller space today model blazer with motor 4 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.199
 weak cylinders 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.689
 is a great gift of the new line of military police vehicles in the state 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.359
 of são paulo its main highlights are machine gun doors in the part 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.699
 rear of the vehicle the division of the acrylic pre-salt cage and the 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.239
 light sirens 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.870
 This vehicle has not yet been used, but in a few years time it has 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.219
 everything to become another great representative of the fleet of pm 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.169
 paulista as well as happens with these great and welcomed the companions 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:46.099
 as happened with the other reports about vehicles highlighted a lot 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.980
 interesting 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.670
 It is always important to highlight the work of these professionals who 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.760
 for everyday safety
