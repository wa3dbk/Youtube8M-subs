00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
and you make the pieces of velcro

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.470 
and you make the pieces of velcro
smaller<00:02:34.950> too<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.549> they're<00:02:35.819> like<00:02:36.000> kind<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.390> like

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
smaller too if they're like kind of like

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.699 
smaller too if they're like kind of like
sticking<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.109> I'll<00:02:37.230> probably<00:02:37.409> have<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
sticking out like I'll probably have to

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.539 
sticking out like I'll probably have to
trim<00:02:37.950> these<00:02:38.400> down<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> little<00:02:38.939> bit<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.450> that's

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
trim these down a little bit but that's

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:49.550
