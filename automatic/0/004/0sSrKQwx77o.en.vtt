00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 would be the answer to our 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:12.389
 problems but then technology creates 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.850
 new problems voice problems 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.670
 then an android disease called zen and 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.740
 He saved us all He 's the balance. 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.260
 between us and the technology taught 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 that the daughter had to be balanced 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 technology can improve our lives 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 but people also 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.930
 and if we focus on one despite 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.860
 of others 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 the balance will end our city will 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 find your way again but this time 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.829
 a gene like our pulse 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:03.750
 so I'll introduce you to neither chanti 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:06.330
 dannyu then what happens after that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.119
 I do not know it does not matter 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.049
 Today is the 200th day and now the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:18.119
 speak for those who knew him 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.810
 George wondered what moved the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.000
 cn 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.869
 I do not know but I like to think that the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 that moved was the brotherhood because he 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.710
 moved and will still move because its 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.630
 remembrance survives on brawls with 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 decision and will never be forgotten 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.450
 wherever you are 100 will always be a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450
 of us
