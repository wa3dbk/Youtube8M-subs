00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.230 
it's always hard to get it ready to
start<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.130> same<00:02:35.310> time<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:37.550> up<00:02:38.550> here<00:02:38.790> like

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
start at the same time so up here like

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:57.980 
start at the same time so up here like
this<00:02:53.570> another<00:02:54.570> thing<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:56.310> watch<00:02:57.240> out<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.540> is

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
this another thing to watch out for is

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.080 
this another thing to watch out for is
when<00:02:58.950> you're<00:02:59.070> doing<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.400> Casselton

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
when you're doing the Casselton

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.580 
when you're doing the Casselton
look<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.780> no<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.230> want<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.440> make

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
look it up like this no you want to make

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.580 
look it up like this no you want to make
each<00:03:04.770> cup<00:03:05.070> count<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:12.330> guess<00:03:13.020> it's<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.230> very

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
each cup count and I guess it's a very

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
each cup count and I guess it's a very
very<00:03:13.800> slight<00:03:14.040> pause<00:03:14.570> you're<00:03:15.570> not<00:03:15.690> actually

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
very slight pause you're not actually

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.690 
very slight pause you're not actually
stopping<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.500> there's<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.220> little<00:03:17.459> bit<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.580> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
stopping but there's a little bit of a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.280 
stopping but there's a little bit of a
pause<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.300> end<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.540> each<00:03:18.660> cut

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
pause at the end of each cut

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.630 
pause at the end of each cut
so<00:03:19.530> each<00:03:19.739> cut<00:03:20.720> counts<00:03:21.720> not<00:03:22.440> bum<00:03:22.770> bum<00:03:23.070> bum<00:03:23.340> bum

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
so each cut counts not bum bum bum bum

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.770 
so each cut counts not bum bum bum bum
