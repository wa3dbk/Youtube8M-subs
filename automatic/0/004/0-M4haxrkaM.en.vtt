going to force Microsoft to wait on
their<00:01:00.090> new<00:01:00.239> technologies<00:01:01.100> because<00:01:02.100> well

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
their new technologies because well

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.910 
their new technologies because well
let's<00:01:03.390> let's<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.050> back<00:01:04.230> to<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.620> you<00:01:04.739> think

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
let's let's think back to do you think

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.230 
let's let's think back to do you think
they've<00:01:05.040> rushed<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.550> is<00:01:05.730> what<00:01:05.940> you're<00:01:06.060> saying

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
they've rushed it is what you're saying

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.150 
they've rushed it is what you're saying
I<00:01:06.480> think<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.020> rushed<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.890> what

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
I think they rushed it much like what

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.550 
I think they rushed it much like what
happened<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.550> Vista<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:10.050> Vista<00:01:10.410> was

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
happened with Vista because Vista was

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
happened with Vista because Vista was
horrible<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.190> then<00:01:11.970> Windows<00:01:12.330> 7<00:01:12.690> which

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
horrible and then Windows 7 which

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.970 
horrible and then Windows 7 which
honestly<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.790> should<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.030> been<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.980> the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
honestly is should have been the the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.690 
honestly is should have been the the
next<00:01:17.960> operating<00:01:18.960> system<00:01:18.990> after<00:01:19.440> XP<00:01:20.010> I<00:01:20.340> think

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
next operating system after XP I think

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.050 
next operating system after XP I think
and<00:01:20.910> now<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.050> think<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.500> should<00:01:22.970> well<00:01:23.970> they

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and now I think they should well they

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.140 
and now I think they should well they
should<00:01:24.300> have<00:01:24.510> ditched<00:01:24.830> windows<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:26.220> let<00:01:27.090> me

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
OS so that we then more readily adopt

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.990

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
laptop market is low sales can we

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.030 
laptop market is low sales can we

account all the low sales of laptops and
desktops<00:04:17.400> too<00:04:17.940> bad<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.350> bad<00:04:19.440> OS<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.430> windows<00:04:20.459> 8

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
desktops too bad a bad OS and windows 8

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.700 
desktops too bad a bad OS and windows 8
or<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.720> just<00:04:21.840> something<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.320> would<00:04:22.560> have

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
or is it just something that would have

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.950 
or is it just something that would have
happened<00:04:22.890> no<00:04:23.310> matter<00:04:23.340> what<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.150> windows<00:04:24.690> 8

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
happened no matter what is windows 8

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.600 
happened no matter what is windows 8
adoption<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.620> low<00:04:25.890> because<00:04:26.100> people<00:04:26.280> just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
adoption so low because people just

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.760 
adoption so low because people just
aren't<00:04:26.850> buying<00:04:27.150> laptops<00:04:27.720> maybe<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.440> isn't<00:04:28.590> a

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
aren't buying laptops maybe it isn't a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.340 
aren't buying laptops maybe it isn't a
one-to-one<00:04:29.220> comparison<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:30.030> maybe<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.930> was

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
one-to-one comparison then maybe it was

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.420 
one-to-one comparison then maybe it was
yeah<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.590> think<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.980> was<00:04:32.040> kind<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.280> like<00:04:32.370> a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
yeah I think it was kind of like a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.710 
yeah I think it was kind of like a
perfect<00:04:32.880> storm<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.450> sense<00:04:33.630> that

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
perfect storm in the sense that

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.570 
perfect storm in the sense that
everything<00:04:34.140> happened<00:04:34.650> at<00:04:34.710> once<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:35.310> kind<00:04:35.550> of

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
everything happened at once it's kind of

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.190 
everything happened at once it's kind of
like<00:04:35.670> right<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.120> had<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.450> tablet<00:04:37.050> we're

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
like right you had the tablet we're

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.900 
like right you had the tablet we're
gonna<00:04:37.290> take<00:04:37.500> off<00:04:37.680> regardless<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.880> know

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
gonna take off regardless of you know

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.220 
gonna take off regardless of you know
windows<00:04:39.360> let's<00:04:39.540> say<00:04:39.600> windows<00:04:39.870> 8<00:04:40.020> would<00:04:40.140> have

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
windows let's say windows 8 would have

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.870 
windows let's say windows 8 would have
been<00:04:40.320> perfect<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:41.190> know<00:04:41.280> tablets<00:04:41.790> were

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
been perfect you know tablets were

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.610 
been perfect you know tablets were
probably<00:04:42.090> still<00:04:42.450> gonna<00:04:42.540> take<00:04:42.780> off<00:04:43.020> but<00:04:43.500> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
probably still gonna take off but the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.890 
probably still gonna take off but the
fact<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.250> know<00:04:44.280> windows<00:04:45.000> 8<00:04:45.210> kind<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.780> got

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
fact that you know windows 8 kind of got

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.140 
fact that you know windows 8 kind of got
like<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.140> lukewarm<00:04:46.380> reception<00:04:46.890> even<00:04:47.640> surface

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150

got like a very lukewarm reception and
at<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> same<00:04:50.430> time<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.850> have<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.060> option<00:04:51.210> of

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
at the same time you have the option of

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.450 
at the same time you have the option of
just<00:04:51.660> going<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.140> tablet<00:04:52.620> versus<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> laptop

it's not our fault yeah yeah i agree i
also<00:05:14.160> think<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.730> think<00:05:15.000> Windows<00:05:15.390> Windows<00:05:15.990> 8<00:05:16.410> is

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
also think I think Windows Windows 8 is

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.150 
also think I think Windows Windows 8 is
a<00:05:16.740> decent<00:05:17.330> tablet<00:05:18.330> operating<00:05:18.780> system<00:05:19.230> but<00:05:20.040> it

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
a decent tablet operating system but it

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.310 
a decent tablet operating system but it
just<00:05:20.400> doesn't<00:05:20.580> translate<00:05:21.090> well<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.900> to

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
just doesn't translate well to the to

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.370 
just doesn't translate well to the to
the<00:05:22.350> laptop<00:05:22.980> environment<00:05:23.850> it's<00:05:24.120> it's<00:05:24.380> it's

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380
