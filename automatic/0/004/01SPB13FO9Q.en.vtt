 not cellulite then it will not be 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.050
 participate texture has no energy 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 because if I do not know it's pure and it gives a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.870
 look at the texture and show I will show 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:44.760

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 Fall is falling if I did something there.

 so k even if she is good and should do 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 Your Dragon Ball Z series is a non-poison. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.079
 This is the first time you are entering 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.420
 we are here in texture is giving a 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 little legg so but it's normal 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 the texture she is she is normal is equal to 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.210
 normal ticket 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.430
 She did not change anything, she did not change anything. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 she 's normal I think she's changed 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:18.570
 but so is one of the glasses in the world has changed 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.439
 in the area has changed nothing 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.990
 it has changed somewhat from the color of the abbot of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 difference is the one we were 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.350
 yesterday everything that changed the most changed a 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.829
 green of the brand kiyoto makeda in 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.840
 This block of light has changed this 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.840
 our different and I know it's a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.950
 the water is right and that it is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.170
 right to say that if it is that inside 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 It's best to see her, she changed. 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.549
 anything 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 she is normal normal but she has a world 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.780
 does not change anything 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.969
 You're going to do it, it would just be the same thing. 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.340
 that you use default there is a 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.890
 texture that already comes with the minecraft you 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.420
 can make a series of dragon ball z 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.580
 with an even default 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.180
 why the dragon ball z year has changed nothing 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.430
 with you can see something changed nothing 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.580
 He walked in the world or even the swords and 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.480
 examiners change if I think that 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.489
 should change because it will not do 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.170
 There's a lot of fun, you keep it. 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.170
 the same is default 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.480
 so she does not change anything and I do not even know why 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.660
 We do not have anything else to talk about because 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.850

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.940

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.450
 tools or the power supply or a 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.430
 building block logo that separative 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:16.019
 they neither stone nor transport nor 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:21.420
 the mishmash and snow of 900 will take this 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:26.879
 I do not know then it's nothing on the side because 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.489

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.620
