00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.240
 it is not 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.770
 let's prepare a table of sausages 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:16.449
 original for this we have chosen a 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:19.750
 ham a mortadella a ham cooked 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.929
 Chorizo ​​bars and it was a bit of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.900
 Loin was chiquitines and fundamental ones 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.900
 bread sticks to roll the sausage 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.210
 we are going to teach you how to wind the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.400
 stuffed to the sticks is a 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.440
 presentation that looks very nice 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 we take the salad always has to 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.579
 to be sausage that is cut very finite 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 We extend the slice 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.640
 we talk a little bit 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.960
 Y 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.960
 we are rolling 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.040
 now we do the same but with the ham 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 serrano you can also use a ham 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.490
 of jabugo but the important thing is that it is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.360
 cut very very finite so that it sticks 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.700
 to the stick finally we will do the same 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.149
 with cooked ham 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.149
 we extend it we put the stick 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.810
 and we wind up and see at some point 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.280
 that is too big 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.280
 we can always cut 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.159
 and take a slice to make two 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.159
 sticks 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.280
 now we are going to place this spirit of 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.150
 chorizo ​​and this is what we have here of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 strong and in between can be nice 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.500
 place some small Alanis 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.150
 and finally a good tenderloin that we're going 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.920
 placing such fan-shaped fan 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.640
 way we have our table of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.179
 very varied sausages 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.330
 finally we put in the center a 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.160
 basket or without basket a few ticos for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.480
 accompany the sausage and we have 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.480
 our table of sausages
