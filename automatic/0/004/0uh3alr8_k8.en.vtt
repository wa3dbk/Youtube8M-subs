00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870

 only in buenaventura but the rest of the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.710
 country and as the contribution also of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.240
 journalism is to show the positive side to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.380
 the bets for peace 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.460
 the different answers I want 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.440
 tell them the story of a group of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.240
 young professionals of buenaventura 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.490
 with equal needs that decided 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.520
 join with other people to help 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.590
 its people 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.880
 a group of friends medical dentists 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.230
 teachers and professionals 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.270
 Buenaventura with the support of the group of 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.650
 coast guard of the national army 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.000
 they travel through the immense and rich peaceful 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.130
 to touch the lives of children in the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.530
 rural areas of products 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.030
 if in my case they are killing themselves but if 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.520
 someone is telling me look there is something 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.120
 beyond look at it's nice yes that 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.129
 you study you can get this 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.559
 I can look the other way and change 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.420
 my destiny hand in hand with education and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.280
 the example lead to the best 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.110
 students from these areas to trips that 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.079
 for you or me to be able to be normal 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.790
 but what made the difference were we born 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.110
 poor but that does not mean that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.530
 we are going to live and we are going to die in the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.510
 poverty 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.159
 we can not change your work culture 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.259
 silent of the foundation smiles for 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.800
 rural children hide their success in a 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.780
 word articulation try to look at that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.670
 do you have that I do that has to 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.759
 able to articulate for some kind of 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.280
 project for the good of this community and 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.380
 it already collects its children children as it exerted 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 with my clear pressure I will finish my 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.270
 school and follow mine chiller and beyond 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.470
 of the stamp of extreme poverty the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.179
 that these communities can live 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.590
 considered as such in Buenaventura 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.539
 what one finds here in these 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.220
 populations in wealth knowing the 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.319
 possibilities of the Colombian Pacific and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.470
 especially of its people one could 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.090
 say that the future is either a 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.950
 future that goes beyond the change of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.300
 government social initiatives 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.100
 even business opportunities 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.050
 that an adventure has a huge 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.340
 biogeographical richness but the most 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.899
 notorious visible 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.310
 and the wealth of its people that 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.530
 mostly responds to the name 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.039
 over the ocean that this habitual wind 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.039
 peaceful 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.380
 that representation of the South Pacific 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.730
 Colombian if you believe at home sir 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.530
 lady that this reality does not touch you 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.480
 I want to say several things the first of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.920
 they are already the main cities 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.540
 they are hosting displaced people 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.580
 they arrive from Buenaventura and they arrive too 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.200
 to continue with that margin of poverty 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.970
 crime in these big capitals 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.410
 that they do not give possibility the second is 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 that they have rights that they want to be 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.250
 made visible and the third thing is that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.050
 they are also Colombians I say goodbye from 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 the South Pacific in the Cauca Valley or 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.630
 in adventure also Colombian will watch 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.630
