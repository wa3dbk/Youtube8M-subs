00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
vehicle like we have here behind us

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.110 
vehicle like we have here behind us
we'll<00:00:35.860> have<00:00:35.950> dual<00:00:36.190> batteries<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.760> we'll<00:00:37.090> use

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
we'll have dual batteries and we'll use

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.479 
we'll have dual batteries and we'll use
some<00:00:37.660> form<00:00:37.960> of<00:00:38.079> isolator<00:00:38.620> or<00:00:38.829> relay<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.430> be

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
some form of isolator or relay to be

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.069 
some form of isolator or relay to be

while<00:00:41.230> we're<00:00:41.350> driving<00:00:41.470> now<00:00:42.250> that's<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.550> good

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
while we're driving now that's a good

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.790 
while we're driving now that's a good
system<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:43.660> what<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:43.899> lacks<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.559> ability

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
system but what it lacks is the ability

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.799 
system but what it lacks is the ability
to<00:00:45.010> fully<00:00:45.340> charge<00:00:45.520> our<00:00:45.940> second<00:00:46.300> battery<00:00:46.660> I

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
to fully charge our second battery I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
mean in the case of the Hilux we've got

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.520 
mean in the case of the Hilux we've got
here<00:00:48.550> behind<00:00:48.910> us<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.630> alternator<00:00:49.989> itself

here behind us the alternator itself

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.709 
here behind us the alternator itself
doesn't<00:00:50.920> have<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.340> voltage<00:00:51.550> capability<00:00:51.969> to

doesn't have the voltage capability to
get<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:53.079> second<00:00:53.469> battery<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:54.100> 100%<00:00:54.520> charge

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
get that second battery to 100% charge

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.880 
get that second battery to 100% charge
which<00:00:55.899> we<00:00:56.020> want<00:00:56.200> we<00:00:56.320> want<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.530> be<00:00:56.590> able<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:56.739> run

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
which we want we want to be able to run

our fridges our lighting for as long as
possible<00:00:58.809> so<00:00:59.230> how<00:00:59.680> are<00:00:59.739> we<00:00:59.829> going<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.070> do<00:01:00.219> that

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
possible so how are we going to do that

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.060 
possible so how are we going to do that
we're<00:01:01.059> going<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.239> use<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.450> DC<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.469> DC<00:01:02.649> battery

charge you can well let's go instead of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.940 
charge you can well let's go instead of
plugging<00:01:13.119> into<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.600> wall<00:01:13.810> actually<00:01:14.710> sits

plugging into the wall actually sits

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.670 
plugging into the wall actually sits
between<00:01:15.310> your<00:01:15.430> two<00:01:15.580> batteries<00:01:16.060> now<00:01:17.020> how<00:01:17.530> it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
between your two batteries now how it

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.399 
between your two batteries now how it
works<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:18.299> it'll<00:01:19.299> sit<00:01:19.510> between<00:01:19.659> battery<00:01:20.200> one

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
works is it'll sit between battery one

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.679 
works is it'll sit between battery one

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
amperage up to 20 amps and then boost

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320 
amperage up to 20 amps and then boost
that<00:01:38.049> voltage<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.860> outputs<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.820> amperage

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
that voltage and outputs that amperage

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.460 
that voltage and outputs that amperage
at<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.450> higher<00:01:40.689> voltage<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.259> what<00:01:41.350> our

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
at a higher voltage and what our

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.350 
at a higher voltage and what our
alternator<00:01:41.710> can<00:01:42.040> do<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.700> then<00:01:42.909> goes<00:01:43.090> through<00:01:43.119> a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
alternator can do it then goes through a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.359 
alternator can do it then goes through a
sixth<00:01:43.750> stage<00:01:43.930> charging<00:01:44.530> pattern<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:45.220> make

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
sixth stage charging pattern to make

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.010 
sixth stage charging pattern to make

to our second battery the other big

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.999 
to our second battery the other big
advantage<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.600> system<00:01:49.930> like<00:01:50.079> this<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.950> that

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
advantage of a system like this is that

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.130 
advantage of a system like this is that
we're<00:01:51.280> able<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.759> get<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.210> charge<00:01:52.540> into<00:01:52.990> that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
we're able to get that charge into that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.630 
we're able to get that charge into that
batteries<00:01:53.560> far<00:01:53.860> more<00:01:54.040> quicker<00:01:54.220> than<00:01:54.369> we<00:01:54.460> can

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
batteries far more quicker than we can

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.350

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
our second battery and we've birthed the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.140 
our second battery and we've birthed the
DC<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.020> DC<00:02:20.170> battery<00:02:20.530> charger<00:02:21.070> but<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.670> biggest

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
DC to DC battery charger but the biggest

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.040 
DC to DC battery charger but the biggest
feature<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.900> Joule<00:02:24.000> 250s<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.480> course<00:02:25.810> is

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
feature of the Joule 250s of course is

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.710 
feature of the Joule 250s of course is
the<00:02:26.260> fact<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.040> has<00:02:27.220> dual<00:02:27.670> inputs<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.630> it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
the fact that it has dual inputs so it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.690 
the fact that it has dual inputs so it
means<00:02:28.960> if<00:02:29.410> we're<00:02:29.620> out<00:02:29.800> there<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.010> our<00:02:30.370> camper

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
means if we're out there in our camper

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.790 
means if we're out there in our camper
trailer<00:02:30.970> we're<00:02:31.810> driving<00:02:32.200> along<00:02:32.320> we're

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800

250s<00:02:43.300> tool<00:02:43.570> we've<00:02:44.110> now<00:02:44.350> got<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.770> solar

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
250s tool we've now got a solar

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.550 
250s tool we've now got a solar
regulator<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:45.910> well<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.570> not<00:02:46.690> only<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.230> DC

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
regulator as well so not only is it a DC

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890 
regulator as well so not only is it a DC
to<00:02:47.680> DC<00:02:47.800> battery<00:02:48.160> charger<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.820> also<00:02:48.940> an<00:02:49.150> MPPT

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
to DC battery charger it's also an MPPT

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.600 
to DC battery charger it's also an MPPT
solar<00:02:50.110> regulator<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.190> you're<00:02:51.310> getting<00:02:51.520> the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
solar regulator so you're getting the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.220 
solar regulator so you're getting the
best<00:02:51.850> potential<00:02:52.360> from<00:02:52.840> two<00:02:53.050> different

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
best potential from two different

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.190 
best potential from two different
sources<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.739> our<00:02:53.950> energy<00:02:54.340> now<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.300> course<00:02:55.540> it's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
sources of our energy now of course it's

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.870 
sources of our energy now of course it's
great<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.650> have<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.800> system<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:57.790> we

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
great to have a system like this but we

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.220 
great to have a system like this but we
also<00:02:57.910> want<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.510> able<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.690> monitor<00:02:59.050> what's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
also want to be able to monitor what's

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.870 
also want to be able to monitor what's
happened<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.160> system<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.610> drawing
