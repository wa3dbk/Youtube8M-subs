00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.970
 my anxiety is the Chinese philosophy that 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.490
 analyst the face if every feature of your 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.950
 face talks about an aspect of your life that 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.980
 you know that we also get social 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.500
 with health issues units is a 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.720
 very interesting philosophy 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.119
 you would know you will not have why 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.869
 know it but you would imagine that your 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.570
 ears speak of your childhood yes and each 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.519
 organ of the face that is going to talk about 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.770
 a particular aspect but before 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.690
 enter fully with this topic I want 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.270
 share with you the flowers of the day of 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.730
 today if you put fresh flowers in your 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.890
 space that more to violence cleans it 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.950
 and the atmosphere is going to feel a lot more 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.289
 much more pleasant quality much more 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.910
 calmed in this case today 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.210
 I want to share the flowers of color 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.520
 white to vibrate in harmony energy 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.680
 and balance because because today we're going 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.230
 to talk about the face and we will detect 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.469
 things that I am going to propose to you with 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.350
 stress how to support yourself in your environment to 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.170
 level 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.549
 trend that we discover in you since 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 the same state is clicked with 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.549
 our ears returned to my ears 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.500
 If it turns out that the ears are located in the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.490
 Children of people when 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 ears are well formed without 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.289
 scars without marks tells us that the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 person had a good childhood 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.830
 obviously that allows us to determine from 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.710
 a person who had a good childhood 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.080
 is able to choose and decide what is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.299
 who wants why why does he have that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.539
 support and support capacity that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.869
 since childhood he learned to live it but you 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.810
 you would think that the big ear symbolizes 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.480
 abundance with wisdom and that the ear 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.480
 small symbolizes practicality 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.520
 I would obviously go home and go to 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.310
 negotiate with a person observes his 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.220
 manager and the ear is great that person 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 Acquire information by listening 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.200
 then you seek to have with that person 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.450
 long talks this is going to take you 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.660
 a good negotiation and obviously you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.720
 are you going to talk in terms of heard me and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.520
 he understood me we came to a fort and you 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.770
 vas is a negotiation with a person 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.720
 from small ears of direct to the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.030
 situation do not give many turns 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.220
 because it is a practical person is a 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.820
 dell atte person 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.500
 you think it 's fast the dynamic you know 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.020
 that the precision of the ears 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.240
 at your risk you can indicate to what 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.930
 stage of your life you will have more success 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.100
 of course the part of the forehead covers the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 youth 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.680
 this middle part covers the stage of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.870
 maturity and from here to here covers the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.810
 old age where your positions are 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.450
 ears to me in this case that stage of the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.240
 maturity that indicates that it is my best stage 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.590
 of success and abundance when you 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.260
 you detect this you can determine 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.050
 and you put all the kilos all the meat 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.200
 to the grill and you save for a good old age 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.930
 there are people who have very low ears 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.849
 means that your best stage of success 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.069
 of recognition and abundance is in 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.680
 the adult stage 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.019
 there are people whose ears are so long 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.989
 ranging from the first phase to the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.750
 longer to observe it that also you 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.299
 It serves to establish negotiations and 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.459
 associations since we have this aspect 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.349
 of the face you knew that the side 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.739
 left that your face 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.769
 talks about the male part and the side 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.660
 right of the female part and I know that 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.430
 in other reading techniques and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.400
 face interpretation is handled at 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.379
 backwards in this not in all that they are 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.450
 Chinese philosophies the left side is 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.579
 male energy the right side the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.129
 of common and female energy on the side 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.560
 left you will see the questions of 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.989
 negotiate the yang part of a person 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.269
 and on the right side you will see your 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.129
 emotions if you are holding a 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.319
 talk with someone a negotiation 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.870
 watch your eyes which one 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.700
 predominates more because it means that it is 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.189
 the plane in which it is in the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.469
 intellectual or emotional if you 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.859
 are you talking to your partner and are you 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:20.019
 handling emotional issues observes 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.360
 your right eye if it starts to 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.070
 open slightly more than the other one that is 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.050
 the one that are entering that plane 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.180
 emotional conversation but if you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.070
 you are doing a negotiation the eye 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.910
 that you have to observe is the eye 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.139
 left true, well, talking about 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.349
 all this situation 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.340
 you can also locate scars 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.340
 brands 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.919
 freckles all that will be associated with something 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.070
 different the part that are called 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.289
 mountains of the face refers to the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.270
 part of the bones for example the

 in front of the chin the cheekbones is the 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.330
 nose 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.190
 obviously those mountains of the face 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.530
 when they are well marked and well 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.139
 formed they tell you about the tenacity of 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.030
 strength of character leadership 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.009
 strong of a person when these 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.870
 traits are marked a person invested 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.660
 strong 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.850
 decided firm if these traits are not 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.740
