and we're not going to do any cutaway
shots<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.300> gonna<00:00:30.420> walk<00:00:30.779> directly<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
shots we're gonna walk directly to the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.549 
shots we're gonna walk directly to the
target<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> concrete<00:00:33.750> once<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.260> shoot

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.889 
target or to the concrete once I shoot
and<00:00:34.770> we're<00:00:34.890> gonna<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.940> condition<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and we're gonna see what condition the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
and we're gonna see what condition the
broad<00:00:37.140> head<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:38.100> pretty

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
broad head is in I have pretty pretty

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.600 
broad head is in I have pretty pretty
good<00:00:38.850> expectations<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> broad<00:00:40.200> head<00:00:40.610> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
good expectations for the broad head the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
good expectations for the broad head the
arrow<00:00:41.850> I'd<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.989> surprised<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> arrow

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
arrow I'd be surprised if the arrow

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.959 
arrow I'd be surprised if the arrow
stands<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> any<00:00:45.030> arrow<00:00:45.570> versus

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
stands up to it any arrow versus

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.119 
stands up to it any arrow versus
concrete<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.590> obviously<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> great

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
concrete is obviously not a great

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
concrete is obviously not a great
combination<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
combination but we're gonna see how the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
combination but we're gonna see how the
broad<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> stands<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.750> let's<00:00:55.309> let's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
broad that stands up and let's let's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:06.469 
broad that stands up and let's let's
launch<00:00:56.610> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.810 

okay<00:01:07.259> so<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:07.950> shot<00:01:08.899> concrete<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
okay so we just shot concrete and it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
okay so we just shot concrete and it
looks<00:01:12.149> like<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.539> arrow<00:01:12.750> didn't<00:01:13.110> blow<00:01:13.259> up<00:01:13.289> with

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
looks like the arrow didn't blow up with

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:27.469 
looks like the arrow didn't blow up with
