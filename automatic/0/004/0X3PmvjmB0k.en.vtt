think that he trained and some sort of

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.009 
think that he trained and some sort of
like<00:00:57.949> forest<00:00:58.579> or<00:00:58.820> jungle<00:00:58.850> environment<00:00:59.570> and

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
like forest or jungle environment and

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.290 
like forest or jungle environment and
