00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
hey guys it's Casey and I'm here with

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.709 
hey guys it's Casey and I'm here with
the<00:00:03.580> design<00:00:04.580> /<00:00:04.910> concept<00:00:05.540> for<00:00:06.640> automated

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:07.719 
the design / concept for automated

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.299 
the design / concept for automated
chicken<00:00:08.719> breeder<00:00:08.990> that<00:00:09.440> automatically

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
chicken breeder that automatically

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.730 
chicken breeder that automatically
clucks<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:10.670> eggs<00:00:10.940> without<00:00:11.210> any<00:00:11.960> chance<00:00:12.500> of

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
clucks the eggs without any chance of

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.940 
clucks the eggs without any chance of
them<00:00:13.280> d<00:00:13.490> spawning<00:00:14.469> so<00:00:15.469> how<00:00:15.589> it<00:00:15.679> works<00:00:15.709> is

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
them d spawning so how it works is

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.980 
them d spawning so how it works is
basically<00:00:16.100> you<00:00:16.430> have<00:00:16.610> standard<00:00:17.360> like<00:00:17.570> chicken

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
basically you have standard like chicken

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.060 
basically you have standard like chicken
breeder<00:00:18.230> setup<00:00:18.620> as<00:00:18.940> you<00:00:19.940> can<00:00:20.060> see<00:00:20.300> it's<00:00:20.830> two<00:00:21.830> by

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
breeder setup as you can see it's two by

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.690 
breeder setup as you can see it's two by
three<00:00:23.060> with<00:00:23.540> signs<00:00:23.870> and<00:00:24.340> water<00:00:25.340> at<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.550> bottom

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
three with signs and water at the bottom

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.600 
three with signs and water at the bottom
and<00:00:25.940> then<00:00:26.840> signs<00:00:27.590> hold<00:00:27.800> up<00:00:27.890> this<00:00:28.100> water<00:00:28.370> which

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
and then signs hold up this water which

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.750 
and then signs hold up this water which
is<00:00:28.760> two<00:00:28.910> by<00:00:29.060> three<00:00:29.240> as<00:00:29.300> well<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.430> what<00:00:31.430> happens

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
is two by three as well and what happens

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.950 
is two by three as well and what happens
is<00:00:31.880> when<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.090> eggs<00:00:32.239> drop<00:00:32.509> from<00:00:32.809> these

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
is when the eggs drop from these

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.459 
is when the eggs drop from these
chickens<00:00:33.429> may<00:00:34.429> go<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.730> water<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:35.469> the

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
chickens may go in the water and the

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.900 
chickens may go in the water and the
water<00:00:36.589> push<00:00:36.890> them<00:00:37.039> towards<00:00:37.280> basidion<00:00:37.699> pipes

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
water push them towards basidion pipes

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.000 
water push them towards basidion pipes
which<00:00:38.239> will<00:00:38.660> collect<00:00:39.019> items<00:00:39.199> that<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.800> throw

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
which will collect items that you throw

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.939 
which will collect items that you throw
at<00:00:40.129> them<00:00:40.280> like<00:00:41.179> that<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:42.469> just<00:00:42.679> shoves

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
at them like that and it just shoves

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.220 
at them like that and it just shoves
them<00:00:43.070> in<00:00:43.249> to<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.760> chest<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.989> need<00:00:45.140> these

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
them in to a chest and you need these

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.189 
them in to a chest and you need these
one-way<00:00:45.559> pipes<00:00:45.859> so<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.809> they<00:00:47.809> don't<00:00:47.929> come

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
one-way pipes so that they don't come

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.689 
one-way pipes so that they don't come
back<00:00:48.350> up<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.769> pipes<00:00:48.980> once<00:00:49.249> they<00:00:49.399> go<00:00:49.550> in

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
back up the pipes once they go in

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.369 
back up the pipes once they go in
because<00:00:49.909> they<00:00:50.059> have<00:00:50.179> tendency<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.600> do<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:50.839> um

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
because they have tendency to do that um

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.849 
because they have tendency to do that um
and<00:00:52.359> that's<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.600> bag<00:00:53.839> collection<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:54.739> can

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
and that's the bag collection so you can

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.610 
and that's the bag collection so you can
see<00:00:55.010> it's<00:00:55.129> clifton<00:00:55.339> if<00:00:55.519> you<00:00:55.609> x<00:00:55.789> here<00:00:56.499> and<00:00:57.499> i<00:00:57.589> can

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
see it's clifton if you x here and i can

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.369 
see it's clifton if you x here and i can
just<00:00:57.890> apply<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.460> was<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.879> throw<00:00:59.089> those<00:00:59.239> in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
see the drop down I go into the pipe and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.649 
see the drop down I go into the pipe and
it's<00:01:08.860> going<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.039> go<00:01:09.189> here<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:10.210> we<00:01:10.299> go<00:01:10.390> into<00:01:10.420> the

part is just this which you saw rail

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.700 
part is just this which you saw rail
crafts<00:01:22.240> feed<00:01:22.810> station<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.380> can<00:01:23.500> just<00:01:23.649> throw

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
crafts feed station you can just throw

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.219 
crafts feed station you can just throw
seeds<00:01:24.039> in<00:01:24.189> there<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.750> update<00:01:26.020> comes

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
seeds in there then the update comes

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.319 
seeds in there then the update comes
this<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.679> be<00:01:26.770> fixed<00:01:27.130> but<00:01:27.329> it's

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
this is going to be fixed but it's

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.460 
this is going to be fixed but it's
supposed<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:28.600> be<00:01:28.689> able<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.899> take<00:01:29.020> seeds<00:01:29.259> but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
supposed to be able to take seeds but

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.679 
supposed to be able to take seeds but
it's<00:01:29.619> just<00:01:29.770> bugged<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.189> it<00:01:30.280> doesn't<00:01:30.579> but<00:01:30.789> in

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
it's just bugged so it doesn't but in

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.510 
it's just bugged so it doesn't but in
the<00:01:31.869> next<00:01:32.470> feed<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.799> beast<00:01:32.950> update<00:01:33.340> which

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
the next feed the beast update which

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.539 
the next feed the beast update which
should<00:01:33.700> be<00:01:33.789> out<00:01:33.990> fairly<00:01:34.990> soon<00:01:35.399> there's<00:01:36.399> an

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
should be out fairly soon there's an

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.039 
should be out fairly soon there's an
updated<00:01:36.939> version<00:01:36.970> of<00:01:37.210> railcraft<00:01:37.569> which<00:01:37.869> has

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
updated version of railcraft which has

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.309 
updated version of railcraft which has
the<00:01:38.259> seeds<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.799> work<00:01:39.670> there<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.319> that'll

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
the seeds that work there so that'll

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.260 
the seeds that work there so that'll
actually<00:01:41.470> take<00:01:42.189> one<00:01:42.399> seed<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.849> breed<00:01:42.939> two

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
actually take one seed and breed two

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.179 
actually take one seed and breed two
chickens<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.560> will<00:01:44.649> only<00:01:44.770> do<00:01:45.009> it<00:01:45.099> if

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
chickens and it will only do it if

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.469 
chickens and it will only do it if
they're<00:01:45.840> ready<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:47.530> eat<00:01:48.310> or<00:01:48.490> whatever<00:01:48.759> so

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
they're ready to eat or whatever so

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.929 
they're ready to eat or whatever so
that's<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.380> concept<00:01:50.740> but<00:01:50.950> until<00:01:51.789> that's

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
that's the concept but until that's

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.539 
that's the concept but until that's
fixed<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.479> just<00:01:52.630> have<00:01:52.720> these<00:01:52.810> trapdoors<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
fixed I just have these trapdoors you

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.149 
fixed I just have these trapdoors you
can<00:01:54.640> just<00:01:54.819> hop<00:01:54.939> in<00:01:55.149> here<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:56.709> feed<00:01:57.039> your

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
can just hop in here and feed your

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.410 
can just hop in here and feed your
chickens<00:01:59.429> like<00:02:00.429> so<00:02:01.799> close<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:02.829> up<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
chickens like so close that up and
