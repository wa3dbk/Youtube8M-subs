unknown<00:02:09.179> girl<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> has<00:02:10.530> grown<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:14.849> think<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
unknown girl and it has grown I think it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.930

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
it brings together art in itself

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270 
it brings together art in itself
all<00:02:20.659> of<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.019> gods<00:02:21.439> pictures<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.189> sculptures

all of the gods pictures and sculptures

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.759

theater<00:02:25.129> with<00:02:25.370> classical<00:02:25.970> ballet<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.569> mean

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
theater with classical ballet I mean

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.319 
theater with classical ballet I mean
that's<00:02:26.989> not<00:02:27.230> normally<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> given<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.030> just

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
that's not normally a given so I just

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.960 
that's not normally a given so I just
feel<00:02:29.629> like<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.110> show<00:02:30.409> is<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:30.829> so<00:02:31.400> special

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
feel like this show is just so special

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.080 
feel like this show is just so special
in<00:02:32.239> something<00:02:32.659> that's<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:33.079> really<00:02:33.439> seen<00:02:34.090> on

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
in something that's not really seen on

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.910 
in something that's not really seen on
Broadway<00:02:35.420> or<00:02:35.720> anywhere<00:02:36.260> right<00:02:36.470> now<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.860> I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
Broadway or anywhere right now and I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.250 
Broadway or anywhere right now and I
think<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.489> that's<00:02:38.480> what<00:02:38.690> makes<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.019> so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
think that that's what makes it so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.520 
think that that's what makes it so
unique<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.400> audiences<00:02:41.000> relate<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.870> the

unique I think audiences relate to the
struggles<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.250> these<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.760> young<00:02:43.970> woman
