00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
table that it's actually like I find

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.360 
table that it's actually like I find
that<00:04:16.049> if<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.500> game<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.799> all<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.160> more

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
that if the game is all the more

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
interesting when you play it on the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.099 
interesting when you play it on the
tabletop<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.799> formations<00:04:20.489> make<00:04:21.150> me<00:04:21.390> giddy

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
tabletop and formations make me giddy

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.500

like truly giddy because moving

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.580 
like truly giddy because moving
formations<00:04:25.289> is

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
formations is

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770 
formations is
freaking<00:04:26.280> hard<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.910> tricky<00:04:27.510> it's

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
freaking hard it's tricky it's

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.820 
freaking hard it's tricky it's
challenging<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:30.419> know<00:04:30.560> kudos<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.740> the

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
people who know how to move because they

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.960 
people who know how to move because they
can<00:04:34.350> go<00:04:34.440> overcome<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:34.979> lot<00:04:35.220> they<00:04:35.430> can<00:04:35.490> overcome

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
can go overcome a lot they can overcome

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.670 
can go overcome a lot they can overcome
a<00:04:36.030> lot<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.360> cardstock<00:04:36.660> if<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.080> can<00:04:37.199> overcome<00:04:37.500> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
a lot of cardstock if it can overcome a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.210 
a lot of cardstock if it can overcome a
lot<00:04:37.889> of<00:04:38.070> like<00:04:38.220> optimized<00:04:39.030> list<00:04:39.330> building

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
lot of like optimized list building

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.080 
lot of like optimized list building
particularly<00:04:41.220> if<00:04:41.490> your<00:04:41.639> opponent<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.030> just

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
particularly if your opponent is just

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.439 
particularly if your opponent is just
not<00:04:42.419> as<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.840> at<00:04:43.050> moving<00:04:43.229> as<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.650> are<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.449> the

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
not as good at moving as you are so the

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.969 
not as good at moving as you are so the
formation<00:04:45.750> thing<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.229> something<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.949> I

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
formation thing is something that I

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.550 
formation thing is something that I
totally<00:04:47.580> love<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.510> love<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.080> think<00:04:49.290> that's

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
totally love I love that I think that's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.330 
totally love I love that I think that's
super<00:04:49.889> cool<00:04:50.070> um<00:04:51.440> I'm<00:04:52.440> looking<00:04:52.680> here<00:04:53.100> at<00:04:53.340> at<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
super cool um I'm looking here at at the

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:03.680 
super cool um I'm looking here at at the
scenario<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:59.120> it<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:02.180> transporters<00:05:03.180> versus

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
scenario and it is a transporters versus

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.460 
scenario and it is a transporters versus
highwayman<00:05:04.260> kind<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:05.180> thing<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.479> actually<00:05:07.110> is

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
highwayman kind of thing it actually is

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.890 
highwayman kind of thing it actually is
really<00:05:07.620> cool<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:07.919> like<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.669> like<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.970> idea<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.389> um

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
through this far and and that sort of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
through this far and and that sort of
thing<00:05:15.450> that's<00:05:15.840> really<00:05:16.080> cool<00:05:16.440> um<00:05:17.810> yeah<00:05:18.810> that's

some of the formations and just trying
them<00:06:00.479> out<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.630> seeing<00:06:00.810> how<00:06:01.020> they<00:06:01.110> go<00:06:01.229> from

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
them out and seeing how they go from

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:02.240 
them out and seeing how they go from
this<00:06:01.500> table<00:06:01.680> is<00:06:01.889> gonna<00:06:01.979> be<00:06:02.130> really

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
this table is gonna be really

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.879 
this table is gonna be really
interesting<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:03.060> yeah<00:06:03.660> as<00:06:03.960> usual<00:06:04.229> you'll<00:06:04.740> get

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
interesting so yeah as usual you'll get

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.339

a<00:06:04.919> more<00:06:05.610> detailed<00:06:06.060> rundown<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.750> these<00:06:06.960> cards

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
a more detailed rundown of these cards

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.050 
a more detailed rundown of these cards
and<00:06:07.500> how<00:06:07.950> I<00:06:07.979> think<00:06:08.280> you<00:06:08.400> can<00:06:08.490> play<00:06:08.669> with<00:06:08.880> them

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
and how I think you can play with them

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.790 
and how I think you can play with them
once<00:06:09.270> I've<00:06:09.389> actually<00:06:09.570> had<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:09.960> chance<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.440> play

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
once I've actually had a chance to play

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.290 
once I've actually had a chance to play
with<00:06:10.889> them

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
with them

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.790 
with them
once<00:06:12.840> we've<00:06:12.960> played<00:06:13.139> some<00:06:13.320> games<00:06:13.500> and<00:06:13.560> you<00:06:13.680> can

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
once we've played some games and you can

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.560 
once we've played some games and you can
actually<00:06:13.889> see<00:06:14.130> them<00:06:14.250> in<00:06:14.310> action<00:06:14.460> in<00:06:14.849> in<00:06:15.180> our
