so ninja boobs is based on the concept

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.240 
so ninja boobs is based on the concept
of<00:00:06.029> playing<00:00:06.390> off<00:00:06.569> each<00:00:06.600> other<00:00:06.899> really

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
defining those moments where you and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.600 
defining those moments where you and
your<00:00:09.660> partner<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.200> working<00:00:11.010> together<00:00:11.130> as

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
your partner are working together as

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.129 
your partner are working together as
well<00:00:11.820> as<00:00:11.940> somewhat<00:00:12.240> separately<00:00:12.630> there<00:00:13.080> are

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
well as somewhat separately there are

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.079 
well as somewhat separately there are
times<00:00:13.410> where<00:00:13.710> I'll<00:00:14.009> initiate<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:14.849> she'll

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
times where I'll initiate or she'll

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
times where I'll initiate or she'll
initiate<00:00:15.540> into<00:00:15.809> certain<00:00:16.080> movements<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> lot

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
initiate into certain movements so a lot

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.859 
initiate into certain movements so a lot
of<00:00:17.100> times<00:00:17.400> we're<00:00:17.699> starting<00:00:18.420> off<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.720> close

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
of times we're starting off in and close

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
of times we're starting off in and close
basically<00:00:19.320> we'd<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:21.000> three

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
basically we'd have one and two three

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.330 
basically we'd have one and two three
and<00:00:21.720> four<00:00:21.930> by<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.830> her<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> little<00:00:23.250> bit

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
and four by going into her a little bit

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
and four by going into her a little bit
further<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.210> great<00:00:24.630> reaction<00:00:25.380> by<00:00:25.560> doing

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
further up a great reaction by doing

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.150 
further up a great reaction by doing
that<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.310> lowering<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.420> duck<00:00:28.109> boom<00:00:28.560> it's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
that by lowering that and duck boom it's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.380 
that by lowering that and duck boom it's
a<00:00:29.220> nice<00:00:29.369> reaction<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.849> creates<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> ripple

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
a nice reaction that creates a ripple

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
a nice reaction that creates a ripple
effect<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.140> allows<00:00:31.920> us<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.430> energy<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
effect and allows us for more energy and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
effect and allows us for more energy and
flow<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.960> release<00:00:34.200> you're<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> track

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
flow to release you're down the track

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.370 
flow to release you're down the track
yeah<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.820> our<00:00:35.940> base<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.600> from<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:37.050> one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
yeah it's our base we go from here one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.459 
yeah it's our base we go from here one
and<00:00:37.710> two<00:00:38.040> three<00:00:38.280> nine<00:00:39.030> four<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:40.170> two

that's<00:01:17.820> all<00:01:17.970> always<00:01:18.450> two<00:01:18.659> ways<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's all always two ways you have the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
that's all always two ways you have the
option<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> doing<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.630> as<00:01:21.630> far<00:01:21.960> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
option of doing that as well as far as

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530 
option of doing that as well as far as
your<00:01:22.259> pattern<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:23.880> she's<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.270> there

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
your pattern out when she's out there

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
your pattern out when she's out there
and<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.020> other<00:01:25.259> options<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.890> well

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and you have other options as well

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.850 
and you have other options as well
mainly<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> open<00:01:27.450> position<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
mainly from the open position about the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
mainly from the open position about the
framing<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.850> she's<00:01:30.060> catching<00:01:30.360> three

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
framing one into she's catching three

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
framing one into she's catching three
and<00:01:31.229> four<00:01:31.590> she<00:01:32.100> doesn't<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.880> she

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and four she doesn't want it then she

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.950 
and four she doesn't want it then she
doesn't<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> quit<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.600> you're<00:01:33.720> leaving

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
doesn't have to quit if you're leaving

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
doesn't have to quit if you're leaving
what's<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> pass<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> way

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
what's that pass it to go all the way

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.719 
what's that pass it to go all the way
through<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.470> triple<00:01:38.280> n<00:01:38.430> step

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
through and back out triple n step

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
through and back out triple n step
number<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> amount<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:40.079> steps<00:01:40.680> per<00:01:40.950> se

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
number the amount of of steps per se

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
number the amount of of steps per se
that<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.610> matters<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.840> how

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that really matters to know about how

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
that really matters to know about how
you're<00:01:43.619> interacting<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.119> when<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> know

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you're interacting and when you know

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
you're interacting and when you know
where<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> yeah<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
where the time to get out is yeah you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.980

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
puts a block on the arm this is very

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.509

much<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> martial<00:02:44.860> arts<00:02:45.010> movement<00:02:45.340> where<00:02:45.430> you

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
much a martial arts movement where you

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.790 
much a martial arts movement where you
see<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.269> kind<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.660> torque<00:02:47.019> in<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.440> arm<00:02:47.650> but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
see this kind of torque in the arm but

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.630 
see this kind of torque in the arm but
you<00:02:47.860> don't<00:02:48.010> want<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> torque<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.489> arm

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you don't want to torque the arm

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.670 
you don't want to torque the arm
obviously<00:02:49.030> be<00:02:49.209> very<00:02:49.390> safe<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:50.200> block<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
obviously be very safe just block the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.370 
obviously be very safe just block the
arm<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.040> then<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.310> slip<00:02:51.550> on<00:02:51.640> out<00:02:51.790> yeah<00:02:52.540> it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
arm and then you slip on out yeah it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.930 
arm and then you slip on out yeah it's
not<00:02:53.560> just<00:02:53.620> enough<00:02:54.100> foot<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.489> like<00:02:54.640> pressure

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
not just enough foot it's like pressure

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.910 
not just enough foot it's like pressure
for<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> rotation<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.019> stop<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:56.680> move

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
for the rotation to stop and then move

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.770 
for the rotation to stop and then move
but<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:57.730> gonna<00:02:57.850> put<00:02:58.420> her<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> bad

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
but it's not gonna put her in a bad

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.190 
but it's not gonna put her in a bad
position

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
position

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.680 
position
so<00:03:00.010> that's<00:03:00.130> part<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.489> rotation<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
so that's part of that rotation and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.340 
so that's part of that rotation and
covered<00:03:02.050> me

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.500 

right<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.830> width<00:03:08.010> two<00:03:08.370> three<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.210> four

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
right so the width two three and four
