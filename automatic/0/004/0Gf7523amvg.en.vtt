replacement is a newer technology it has

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
replacement is a newer technology it has
many<00:00:37.290> benefits<00:00:37.860> over<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> standard<00:00:38.879> or

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
many benefits over the standard or

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.930 
many benefits over the standard or
traditional<00:00:39.440> anterior<00:00:40.440> cervical<00:00:40.710> fusion<00:00:41.489> in

some instances the fusion is necessary

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
some instances the fusion is necessary
however<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.270> benefit<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> artificial

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
however the benefit of the artificial

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
however the benefit of the artificial
disc<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> preserves<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.360> motion<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
disc is that it preserves the motion the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
disc is that it preserves the motion the
normal<00:00:49.620> motion<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.489> level<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> spine

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
normal motion at that level of the spine

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
normal motion at that level of the spine
whereas<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> fusion<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.399> eliminate<00:00:53.699> motion

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
whereas a fusion will eliminate motion

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
whereas a fusion will eliminate motion
of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> disc<00:00:54.989> where<00:00:55.260> you're<00:00:55.440> fusing<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
of the disc where you're fusing the
