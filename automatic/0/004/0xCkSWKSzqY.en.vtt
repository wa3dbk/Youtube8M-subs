00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that that's complete we've overlaid our

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.090 
that that's complete we've overlaid our
air<00:01:48.899> SDK<00:01:49.740> into<00:01:50.100> our<00:01:51.090> Flex<00:01:51.509> SDK<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.860> next

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

step<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.550> to<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.060> into<00:01:54.300> Flash<00:01:55.110> Builder<00:01:55.410> 4<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
step is to go into Flash Builder 4 and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.710 
step is to go into Flash Builder 4 and
add<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> SDK<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.940> I've<00:01:59.940> opened<00:02:00.209> up<00:02:00.450> Flash

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720
