00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.550
 first I found this so 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 it's a container for me of lemonade 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.970
 of water what you want with a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.039
 small tap at the end to sink 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 so it's a 3 liter container 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.570
 there are some at Casa's houses 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 world and in other places he's me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.630
 I seem to me the bonfires actions at 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.340
 prices in blue there are also 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 other colors there is red rose 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.739
 the yellow of the green and the blue of the blow and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.399
 it costs only 4 euros finally 3 euros 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.190
 99 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 suddenly here I lai I embark 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.460
 had spotted it on the site I got 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 said hey I'll try to find him and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.690
 I found them arriving so perfect 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.820
 I'm really happy with those of this purchase 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 in the second I found myself a hat 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.789
 black straw I also took in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.559
 normal color straw color it's not 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.270
 at all we are called here I am 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 found pretty cool and I priced them because 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 they cost everything it cost 1 euro 49 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.470
 here in euros 49 by cons is huge 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 but I do not think so I think it can 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.869
 to give well in summer like that I have a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 network it is too ugly 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.060
 by cons it is huge but really 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.520
 huge but in summer I think it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 can still be joly we'll see for sure 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.829
 a 49 euro anyway even though I the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.409
 put one time it came back to 49 what 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.820
 then by chance that same step that he 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.610
 did that I found something that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.799
 I was looking for a long time 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.420
 since this is an objective bug I 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.680
 do not know if you're like me but I 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.689
 had been looking for him for too long and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 on asos they were between 15 and 20 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.439
 euros on amazon and where I found hyper 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.549
 dear and here it is to which I pray them two 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.899
 time because when I saw the price I 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.969
 I said I need one for my 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.030
 buddy because it cost 3 euros 99 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.590
 that's 3 euros 99 what I 'm going too much 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.420
 happy to find him 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.920
 frankly I did not expect then 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.929
 I took two little notebooks 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.930
 like this I really find them too 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.640
 cabbage is actually the one fx 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.849
 2 so when you open it you have 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.920
 three kinds of papers so there is a 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.170
 paper for what to do what to buy and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.060
 the notes and here I was too much 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.950
 cool frankly that's a good way 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.239
 to organize 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.219
 if you are like me with you 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.030
 like to write on note pads on 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.549
 notebooks etc 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.200
 go for it costs only 69 cents and 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.400
 they are super pretty I took the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.590
 black and the one like these a little 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.730
 colorful and had others super pretty 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.079
 but I said to myself I'm not going all 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.269
 ship so I took only two 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.060
 suites I took this is so it's a 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.030
 protection for iphone and samsung it me 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.950
 seems yes for iphone samsung and any 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.299
 the clique and it is to be able to put 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400
 his iphone in the water I saw that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.139
 charlene from cape had taken 1 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.269
 when she was at the parks center 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.650
 I said to myself I do not know if I 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.780
 risk putting it in the water but 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.530
 for the summer to protect sand it's 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.959
 always effective 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.829
 so I priced them and so that cost 1 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.629
 euros 29 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.849
 then I finally got my hands on a 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.230
 split hours that's been a long time 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.530
 that I was looking for and there they were not 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.979
 expensive at all since he was at 79 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.199
 hundredths 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.120
 so that's just for 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.859
 put one to hook two headsets or 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.569
 two headphones when you watch a 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.139
 loving film in the train it's 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.079
 much better 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.150
 here it is much better and I have that 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.199
 that to say I really like the principle and 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.769
 So it's been a long time since I 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:36.590
 was looking for one so 79 cents I dark 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.299
 Then I took the peak crisis 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.000
 risk i do not know at all how 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.209
 is called crispy christ which in fact this 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.609
 are dried fruits 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.989
 so I took to the apple once and from 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.470
 to the sentence but has one that I already have 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.669
 finished 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.199
 Besides, I'll take them for 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.629
 go to my boyfriend's house I believe in that 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.069
 I like to eat here I am 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.290
 finds pretty good anyway the one at the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.389
 sentence is that quite surprising actually 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.790
 but it's really good and it does not cost 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.159
 than 69 cents and there are 63 calories in it 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.889
 so here's for a little snack a 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.549
 little hot snack that's really perfect 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.139
 apparently there are some who are not 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.879
 super super good but first what I have 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.739
 read the sentence is the good and the apple 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.209
 are very good so that's why 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.280
 I took these is then what 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.229
 I brought back and I preferred to bring back 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.010
 that's why I was going doing 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.870
 are storage makeup 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.229
 I had not weighed at all 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.520
 reaction and then here I saw some 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.699
 storage makeup and I dark 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.960
 so I took two kinds I have 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.350
 brought back three because I took two 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.940
 times the same 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.080
 I have already arranged my makeup 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.240
 so I will try to show you 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.660
 as I can so the first one 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.860
 present like this so you have 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.510
 wait i'll wear it like that so 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.120
 you have trouble for red to 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.000
 lips and seems to me that the 12 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.740
 you have a great location here from 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.729
 small locations here is kind of 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.180
 two great location here everything 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.220
 simply 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.110
 so here it is very very resistant 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.130
 it's pretty thick so here it is 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.650
 really big storage in 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.740
 acrylic and so that this was costing 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.520
 only 229 that's dark girls so 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.919
 you are looking for returns in 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.330
 makeup they are super super convenient 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.130
 so that's the first one I took 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.180
 and the second frankly that I took 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.699
 normally it is a connection to 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.710
 jewels but I use it as orange 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.840
 or in make-up so if you want 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.350
 disturb not like this here I am you 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.630
 shows so these are two drawers but 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.070
 quite narrow enough actually that's why 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.750
 that these are not the drawers as 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.250
 I had on amazon they are a lot 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.960
 narrower but they are perfect for 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.099
 lipsticks and me that's what 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.270
 I was looking for storage space for me 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.380
 lipstick because I had it 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.729
 tired to put all the time in 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.380
 their drawers I want it all on my 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.360
 hairdresser now so I go back to 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.370
 tour is organized 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.330
 so I took this if the gemmi 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.120
 only everything but lipstick 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.880
 catrice play the prizes twice so i have 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.440
 four drawers in all and they are more 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.210
 small and so as I told you 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.500
 that amazon storage but he goes there 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.580
 only 2 euros and 9 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.020
 here is in the storage amazon in 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.360
 my amazon novels i put my between 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.310
 students and my ice cream is clearly his 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.900
 will not go into that in this because 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.349
 it's too long but for the reds 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.849
 lips 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.940
 you see that it comes back and who still has 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.740
 a little space so here I find it 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.689
 super pretty is super convenient to these 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:23.189
 very small is so small so that's it 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:25.379
 and I put the separators above 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.209
 for lipstick with my red is 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.349
 favorite so above this one has by 

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:31.769
 example but red with mac 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.789
 that's it but for 201 9 choices it was 

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.049
 a good deal and I really 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.669
 really want to talk to you about it 

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:37.079
 so here I am really sorry 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.869
 to have already arranged my makeup but 

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:41.219
 at least you see what that gives so 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:44.279
 here I will try to make a view 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:46.229
 overall what it can give to 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:48.059
 side of my hosts storage you dream 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.889
 who are much smaller so that's it 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:51.569
 and here he was doing everything for my role 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.039
 action i hope it will please you if 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.569
 it does little thumbs-up 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.219
 it's a real pleasure 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.749
