00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.270 
retention from the Germans coming in
yeah<00:00:09.730> and<00:00:10.090> how<00:00:10.900> does<00:00:10.960> it<00:00:11.260> do<00:00:11.380> that<00:00:17.280> physical

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
yeah and how does it do that physical

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.460 
yeah and how does it do that physical
barriers<00:00:19.830> exactly<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.060> then<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:23.170> kind<00:00:23.410> of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
barriers exactly and then what kind of

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
barriers exactly and then what kind of
how<00:00:23.830> many<00:00:23.980> kinds<00:00:24.190> of<00:00:24.220> immunity<00:00:24.699> are<00:00:24.789> there

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
how many kinds of immunity are there

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:39.719 
how many kinds of immunity are there
yeah<00:00:27.010> what<00:00:27.279> kind<00:00:37.379> passive<00:00:38.379> passes<00:00:39.159> how<00:00:39.550> many

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
yeah what kind passive passes how many

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.369 
yeah what kind passive passes how many
types<00:00:39.969> of<00:00:40.120> active<00:00:40.510> immunity<00:00:41.019> are<00:00:41.170> there<00:00:41.909> no

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
types of active immunity are there no

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.209 
types of active immunity are there no
yeah<00:00:44.409> what<00:00:44.859> kinds<00:00:48.359> Naturals<00:00:49.469> natural

what's artificial active immunity and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:38.760 
what's artificial active immunity and
what<00:01:25.930> do<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.200> antibodies<00:01:26.770> do<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.650> that

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
what do the antibodies do this is that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.450 
what do the antibodies do this is that
what<00:01:38.920> they<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.130> yeah<00:01:39.760> okay<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.660> how<00:01:41.470> who<00:01:42.220> makes

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
what they do yeah okay and how who makes

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.180 
what they do yeah okay and how who makes

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
foreign is a very good chemical yeah

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.179 
foreign is a very good chemical yeah
what<00:03:07.519> was<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.730> other<00:03:07.790> kind<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.209> oh<00:03:08.480> yeah

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
what was the other kind of oh yeah

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:20.909 
what was the other kind of oh yeah
memory<00:03:10.189> Chi<00:03:10.430> cell<00:03:10.579> what<00:03:10.730> do<00:03:10.819> they<00:03:10.939> do<00:03:12.729> remember

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
who that's that killed Peter the memory

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.189 
who that's that killed Peter the memory
guy<00:03:43.430> what<00:03:43.609> did<00:03:43.760> he<00:03:43.849> do<00:03:44.030> he<00:03:44.329> told<00:03:44.629> the<00:03:44.780> B<00:03:44.930> cell

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
guy what did he do he told the B cell

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:50.050 
guy what did he do he told the B cell
that<00:03:46.010> Peter<00:03:46.250> was<00:03:46.430> bad<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:49.400> B<00:03:49.549> salad<00:03:49.909> brought

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that Peter was bad the B salad brought

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.539 
that Peter was bad the B salad brought
the<00:03:50.209> antibodies<00:03:50.659> yeah<00:03:51.199> okay<00:03:51.859> now<00:03:52.010> what<00:03:52.310> our

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
the antibodies yeah okay now what our

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.170 
the antibodies yeah okay now what our
suppressor<00:03:53.389> T<00:03:54.319> cells<00:03:54.349> do<00:03:55.340> what<00:03:55.909> do<00:03:56.030> they<00:03:56.120> do

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
suppressor T cells do what do they do

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:09.490 
suppressor T cells do what do they do
they<00:03:57.699> do<00:04:04.449> what<00:04:05.449> is<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:07.780> remember<00:04:08.780> when<00:04:08.989> rwan

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
they do what is it remember when rwan

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.410 
they do what is it remember when rwan
gets<00:04:09.739> better<00:04:09.979> what<00:04:10.310> happens

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.600 

diesel<00:04:15.420> better<00:04:15.660> memories<00:04:16.320> say<00:04:16.590> no<00:04:17.010> the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
diesel better memories say no the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.790 
diesel better memories say no the
suppressor<00:04:18.150> two<00:04:18.360> phones<00:04:18.630> they<00:04:19.230> say<00:04:19.440> stuff

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
suppressor two phones they say stuff

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.150 
suppressor two phones they say stuff
everybody<00:04:20.700> she's<00:04:21.120> done<00:04:21.450> she's<00:04:22.110> done<00:04:22.160> hey

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
everybody she's done she's done hey

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.440 
everybody she's done she's done hey
could<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.760> stop

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
could you stop

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:33.350 
could you stop
he's<00:04:24.720> already<00:04:25.140> well<00:04:25.730> everybody's<00:04:32.120> okay<00:04:33.120> and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
he's already well everybody's okay and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.240 
he's already well everybody's okay and
then<00:04:33.900> what<00:04:34.560> else<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.830> there<00:04:35.010> what<00:04:35.100> are<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
then what else is there what are the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.400 
then what else is there what are the
kinds<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.700> that's<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.720> think<00:04:37.050> is<00:04:37.170> that<00:04:37.290> all

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
kinds of that's it I think is that all

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.190 
kinds of that's it I think is that all
of<00:04:37.440> them<00:04:37.620> unity<00:04:38.040> or<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.190> there<00:04:38.310> anything<00:04:38.460> else

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
of them unity or is there anything else

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.220 
of them unity or is there anything else
good<00:04:40.200> girl<00:04:40.470> now<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.770> help<00:04:40.920> me<00:04:41.040> study
