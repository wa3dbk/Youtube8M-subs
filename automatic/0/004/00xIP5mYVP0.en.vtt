was 33 fads I guess you could say ads
trends<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.010> willing<00:00:56.489> fashion<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> will

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
trends in willing fashion that I will

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.560 
trends in willing fashion that I will
never<00:00:57.629> do<00:01:00.770> my<00:01:01.770> first<00:01:02.280> trend<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> don't

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
never do my first trend that I don't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
never do my first trend that I don't
think<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.049> ever<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:05.220> circle

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
think I would ever get into these circle

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.500 
think I would ever get into these circle
lenses<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:07.070> think<00:01:08.070> they're<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.640> cute<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
lenses I think they're really cute and I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
lenses I think they're really cute and I
would<00:01:09.780> love<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.040> won't<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
would love to but I won't because I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
would love to but I won't because I
can't<00:01:12.510> wear<00:01:12.659> contacts<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.619> eyes<00:01:13.770> are

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
can't wear contacts because my eyes are

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.399 
can't wear contacts because my eyes are
really<00:01:14.130> sensitive<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.970> usually<00:01:15.840> wear<00:01:15.990> glasses

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.830 

usually<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:21.570> um<00:01:22.130> yeah<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.210> think<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.689> would

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
usually but um yeah so I think it would

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
usually but um yeah so I think it would
have<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.500> hard<00:01:25.619> time<00:01:25.799> getting<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.340> out

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
have a really hard time getting them out

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
have a really hard time getting them out
and<00:01:27.439> obviously<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> need<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.890> really

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and obviously you need to be really

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.230 
and obviously you need to be really
hygienic<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.909> contact<00:01:30.840> lenses<00:01:31.939> by<00:01:32.939> not

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
hygienic with your contact lenses by not

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.410 
hygienic with your contact lenses by not
sleeping<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> time<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.420> would

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
sleeping in them all the time I would

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
sleeping in them all the time I would
probably<00:01:36.600> either<00:01:37.229> forget<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
probably either forget and or not be

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.310 
probably either forget and or not be
able<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.540> them<00:01:39.689> out<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:39.930> away<00:01:40.079> without

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
able to take them out right away without

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.300 
able to take them out right away without
giving<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> cry<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.100> first

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
giving up and cry so that's the first

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.710 
giving up and cry so that's the first
time<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> would<00:01:45.360> ever<00:01:45.390> get

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
time that I don't think I would ever get

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.889 
time that I don't think I would ever get
into<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:47.340> second<00:01:47.700> trend<00:01:48.470> isn't<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
into the second trend isn't really a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.389 
into the second trend isn't really a
newer<00:01:51.899> trend<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> has<00:01:53.009> been<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> past

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
newer trend but it has been in the past

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.830 
newer trend but it has been in the past
I<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.530> ever<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.040> back<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.840> but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I don't see it ever going back to but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
I don't see it ever going back to but
it's<00:01:58.229> okay<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.670> knee<00:02:00.329> socks<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:02.070> I'm<00:02:02.340> sure<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it's okay is a knee socks and I'm sure a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.520 
it's okay is a knee socks and I'm sure a
lot<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.119> girls<00:02:03.689> would<00:02:03.869> agree<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.170> me<00:02:04.320> about

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
lot of girls would agree with me about

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.910 
lot of girls would agree with me about
why<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.350> knee<00:02:07.619> socks

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
why we don't really go into knee socks

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.330 
why we don't really go into knee socks
because<00:02:08.399> knees<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.569> kind<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
because knees are kind of

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.190 
because knees are kind of
not<00:02:11.330> attractive<00:02:11.900> at<00:02:13.120> least<00:02:14.120> mine<00:02:14.300> some<00:02:14.870> people
