00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.289
 Hi there, you're on the big channel 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.869
 fire apple and today will tell you how 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.689
 disassemble and clean your penny if he 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.369
 suddenly became dirty and squeaks so what 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.340
 for this we will need of course 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.450
 special key for disassembling skateboard 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 such are sold everywhere worth 700 rubles 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.969
 but I ordered with ebay for 150 rubles 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 we also need silicone spray 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.010
 lubrication of the form 40, I can be over 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.829
 use another for cars for example and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 so let's proceed to the disassembly 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.540
 on penny used here such 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 the screw is therefore used this part on 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.310
 big skateboards used here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.730
 such is the key that also goes together 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.410
 with all the keys begin to disassemble 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.630
 counterclockwise it is unscrewed 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.450
 the whole thing here is the first shybochka 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 still such a stub is their main not 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 lose and but because you can't 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.360
 they are nowhere to be found on these of course you can but 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.830
 it will be very problematic 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 we postpone their prominent place so as not to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.260
 lose further we remove here such 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 rubber bullshit so here it is 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.240
 It looks and they, too, now we wash only 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 take it off just like that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.400
 remove it with motions and strongly braids 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.780
 we will clean as well remove the remnants of it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.920
 Here is such a metal figure 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.890
 rubber well sorry i don't know how 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.090
 something called the second time in life and 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.280
 that's what we have left for her 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 Now my parts are important so that they have 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520
 you did not fall into the crawfish so close 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:01.869
 her 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:04.310
 and now all that remains is my water too 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.679
 it is not necessary to do this important then 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.959
 this is a good deal to lubricate now 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.580
 take here such a gel lubricant and how I 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 would say for cars you can take it 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:20.120
 matter and fill in the space from start up 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.760
 there will be many and fear nothing not 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.940
 will just make it well soak I want 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.860
 in all places it is necessary to lubricate it to 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.299
 nowhere worthless and creaking can 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.750
 even these screwdrivers are not important 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:38.660
 further what we do we take the very bottom and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.280
 we collect it basically back so this 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.989
 everything is done to nothing here 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.079
 can creak 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.150
 here, too, now gel drop to all 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:55.879
 it was just perfect here outwardly some water 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:01.069
 and it is necessary to merge and leave only a lot of everything 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:06.829
 great dress stood on this is 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:10.010
 here's the thing pm hayes turns fine well 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:13.959
 so that the wheel is still well spun 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.040
 Now here you can drip and spray krutanut 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.290
 get even just then put on and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.280
 ride to make it all good 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.900
 soaked and 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.630
 It was all very quickly insert the main thing 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.250
 more feasible so that there is no squeak 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.579
 here, too, spray that everything was 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.620
 all right 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:39.410
 And and dog them this thing until 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.900
 end to all good hold on 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.260
 we put it here I will call her 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:50.419
 the seal is also stronger and twists 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.049
 initially finger then twist already 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.049
 key 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.849
 clockwise that's all now all 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.040
 you will have a quick ride with this 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.870
 the parties are doing the same thing now 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.970
 I won't show it to you 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.769
 video goes long enough so 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.870
