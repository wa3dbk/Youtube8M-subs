00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.980
The other night dear

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.180
As I lay sleeping

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.250
I dreamed I held you

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.540
In my arms

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.080
When I awoke dear

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.280
I was mistaken

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.250
and I hung my head and cried

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900
You are my sunshine

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.180
My only sunshine

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.450
You make me happy

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.660
When skies are grey

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.930
You'll never know dear

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.810
How much I love you

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.360
Please don't take my sunshine away

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.200
I'll always love you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.100
And make you happy

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.620
If you will only

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.200
Stay the same

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.410
But if you leave me

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.040
To love another

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.980
You'll regret it all someday

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.940
You are my sunshine

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.250
My only sunshine

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.160
You make me happy

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.250
When skies are grey

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.400
You'll never know dear

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.730
How much I love you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.900
Please don't take my sunshine away

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.110
You told me once, dear

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.030
You really loved me

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.290
And no one else could come between.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.310
But now you've left me

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.710
And love another

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.620
You have shattered all of my dreams

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.210
You are my sunshine

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.290
My only sunshine

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.510
You make me happy

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.400
When skies are grey

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.610
You'll never know dear

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.820
How much I love you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.630
Please don't take my sunshine away
