00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.230
 brew tea pu er 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 now here is a qr came to me in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 I have already made one of these tablets 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 tasted good tea good strong so 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.420
 that we will need a kettle where we will be 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:28.310
 brew a mug from which we will drink 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.310
 so first we need to heat the dishes and 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:48.890
 boiling water deer they like that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.890
 here we warm up a teapot mug 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.620
 sandstone go out in a mug was warming up 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.730
 kettles brew directly 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.730
 actually nothing complicated 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 here we have such compressed here 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:18.570
 the object we throw here 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:30.210
 pour out the remnants and actually wash 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:42.110
 tea for washing the tea we need to pour it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:42.110
 boiling water a little wait then fly out 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.220
 and so this is how we washed the tea we have it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.220
 again pour boiling water 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.369
 so my boiling water and now that he 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.700
 we will be brewing already covered 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.630
 him 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.770
 and from one to three minutes we will have it 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.319
 to collapse and so pass how it went 3 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.850
 minutes we have tea brewed and ready for 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.940
 addict let's out of the mug you poured 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.940
 water 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.770
 Of course you can pass but I'm alone 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.060
 hand is not convenient to shoot like this 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.060
 we have seagulls 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:11.940
 Now we will fill it with boiling water and we will 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:15.660
 drink it is better to drink it without anything to 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.459
