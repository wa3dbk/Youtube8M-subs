of a kind of pisses a lot of people off
because<00:02:44.390> pacquiao<00:02:45.390> said<00:02:45.690> no<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:47.070> drug<00:02:47.340> testing

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
because pacquiao said no to drug testing

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.760 
because pacquiao said no to drug testing
back<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:48.930> they<00:02:49.050> were<00:02:49.080> talking<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
back when they were talking about the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.090 
back when they were talking about the
mayweather<00:02:50.160> fight<00:02:51.290> which<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.500> kind<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.860> agree

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
mayweather fight which I kind of agree

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.160 
mayweather fight which I kind of agree
with<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.400> think<00:02:53.459> he<00:02:53.640> should<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:53.880> said<00:02:54.060> yes<00:02:54.239> but

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
with I think he should have said yes but

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
with I think he should have said yes but
without<00:02:55.410> being<00:02:55.650> said<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.160> would<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.120> said<00:02:57.300> no

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
without being said I would have said no

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.000 
without being said I would have said no
to<00:02:58.010> because<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.250> putting<00:03:00.239> myself<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:01.010> pacquiao

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
to because I putting myself in pacquiao

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.220 
to because I putting myself in pacquiao
shoes<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.610> probably<00:03:03.390> won't<00:03:03.780> listen<00:03:04.050> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
shoes I probably won't listen to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.970 
shoes I probably won't listen to
Mayweather<00:03:04.680> or<00:03:04.950> whatever<00:03:05.340> he<00:03:05.459> says<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.950> I

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
Mayweather or whatever he says so I

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.009 
Mayweather or whatever he says so I
probably<00:03:08.280> would<00:03:08.610> say<00:03:08.820> no<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:09.870> then<00:03:09.989> again

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
probably would say no but but then again

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.190 
probably would say no but but then again
man<00:03:10.410> saying<00:03:10.769> yes<00:03:11.209> what<00:03:12.209> about<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.660> made<00:03:13.050> it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
man saying yes what about this made it

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.390 
man saying yes what about this made it
simpler<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.780> fight<00:03:16.739> probably<00:03:17.220> would

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
simpler and the fight probably would

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.949 
simpler and the fight probably would
have<00:03:17.489> happened<00:03:17.880> but<00:03:18.329> I'm<00:03:18.450> already<00:03:18.630> convinced

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
have happened but I'm already convinced

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.979 
have happened but I'm already convinced
that<00:03:19.380> even<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:19.890> pacquiao<00:03:20.250> said<00:03:20.430> yes<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.480> drug

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
that even if pacquiao said yes to drug

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.050 
that even if pacquiao said yes to drug
testing<00:03:22.470> back<00:03:22.650> then<00:03:22.709> I'm<00:03:23.310> pretty<00:03:23.760> sure<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
testing back then I'm pretty sure the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.140 
testing back then I'm pretty sure the
fight<00:03:24.269> would<00:03:24.450> still<00:03:24.810> not<00:03:25.019> happen<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:26.030> think<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
fight would still not happen I think the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.250 
fight would still not happen I think the
real<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:28.260> real<00:03:28.290> issue<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.100> bit<00:03:29.280> between

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
real the real issue is the bit between

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.990 
real the real issue is the bit between
Bob<00:03:31.260> Arum<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.860> Mayweather<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:32.850> that's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
Bob Arum and Mayweather I think that's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.789 
Bob Arum and Mayweather I think that's
the<00:03:33.120> main<00:03:33.239> issue<00:03:33.299> for<00:03:33.900> why<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.260> fight<00:03:34.560> hasn't

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
the main issue for why the fight hasn't

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.350 
the main issue for why the fight hasn't
happened<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:37.519> yeah<00:03:38.519> drug<00:03:38.790> testing<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.269> this

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
happened so yeah drug testing in this

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.050 
happened so yeah drug testing in this
fight<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:40.640> lot<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.700> people<00:03:41.910> are<00:03:42.000> saying<00:03:42.150> that

fight a lot of people are saying that
Pacquiao<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.090> finally<00:03:45.690> clean<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:47.959> they<00:03:48.959> were

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
Pacquiao is finally clean so they were

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.229 
Pacquiao is finally clean so they were

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
drug testing in this fight I think it's

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.190 
drug testing in this fight I think it's
going<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.880> be<00:04:45.000> like<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.690> said<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.110> it's
