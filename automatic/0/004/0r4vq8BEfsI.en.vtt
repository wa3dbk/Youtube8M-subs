00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends with you dmitry him 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.029
 I finished you a couple but my opinion 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.400
 useful tips that will help 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.630
 extend the running time of your samsung 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.630
 galaxy s4 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.269
 First you need the answer 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.100
 turn on power saving mode 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.530
 This is one of the most important factors for 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.050
 saving your samsung galaxy 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.730
 s4 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.769
 the second is the cake that you should 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.969
 adjust the brightness for yourself that is 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.559
 make it duller 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.440
 in my opinion it should be here 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.269
 something like this for yours for yours 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.250
 eye it should be a little bit more 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.119
 dimmer will be worse already 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.619
 the brink of such 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.780
 for your eyes it will be much 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.490
 more useful and actually when you 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.259
 brightness very quickly get used to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.380
 it is useful for your eyes and for 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.909
 battery of your smartphone 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.950
 further followed was to remove all 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.780
 multitasking applications 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.909
 You hold it among a button and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.710
 These applications appear here. 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.990
 and panel and multitasking 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.509
 loss is cleared in fact everything here 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.399
 so done that it does not affect 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.970
 practically at play 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.670
 still you can be safe our 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.060
 the next step is to turn off 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.039
 different notifications you know i am connected 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.810
 jam and here it is and if you have it 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.759
 mail.ru mail.ru 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.039
 Often the word will be all like 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.320
 position to be a push and I advise you 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.960
 distinguish these push notifications and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.899
 all sorts of reminders for savings 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.710
 your and batteries 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.219
 our next step is 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.200
 disabling data transfer if you 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.630
 use the mobile internet it 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.159
 not so important factor and power you are not 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.619
 distinguish but for those who do not use 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.290
 Internet you go to the lattice and 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.170
 mobile data turn off click yes 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.540
 and you turn off mobile data 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.030
 it will certainly help save for 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.150
 savings investigators are what we need 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.500
 make it go to settings 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.049
 Of course you need to turn off Wi-Fi and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.709
 especially the system glare the system 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.140
 bluetooth 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.880
 we have a lot of energy selects we 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 big score if you don't pass 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.359
 data then you don't need it anymore 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.859
 disable the nfc s beam module unless of course 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.859
 you do n't use them 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.550
 further here in the settings find it out 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.860
 tab my device and here you need 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.770
 go in motion and gestures in this section 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.320
 a lot of bells and whistles and let's go 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.550
 for example gesture control you can 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.450
 set up all these movements here and 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.700
 gestures for themselves 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.710
 if some you do not use 100 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.940
 of course their sethley and some 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.550
 include in this section 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
 but if you wo n't start at all 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.230
 queue and immediately the whole section with movements 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.230
 the same have some use 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.330
 then of course disconnect what contrit 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.240
 specifically but again and differing and 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.010
 Immediately and palm control, too, I 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.990
 I distinguish further we go into the smart screen 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.080
 here too if you need something you 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.170
 leave if not then turn off like 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.160
 actually do 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.230
 but if you have enabled the function 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.720
 voice control of your smartphone 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.750
 then of course turn off the skin and function 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.989
 Instantly browse too, distinguish if 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.600
 you and do not use we actually 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.070
 finally we come here and you should 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.940
 be here's an example that you can still 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.800
 disable auto-rotate here you should 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.870
 be all here so here are a few windows all 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.330
 it's off everything should be off 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.840
 and sync sheet too can 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.549
 turn off but all actually 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.430
 what I wanted to show you all these methods 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.109
 for a little bit but will save a lot 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.340
 your 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.950
 energy saving approximately twice 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.950
 have your mars will like you two 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.960
 and maybe even three times longer than all
