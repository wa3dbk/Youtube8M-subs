inside the bottle is a small tube with
the<00:00:56.920> water<00:00:57.920> indicating<00:00:58.610> solution<00:01:00.070> so<00:01:01.070> what

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
the water indicating solution so what

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.439 
the water indicating solution so what
we're<00:01:01.370> going<00:01:01.520> to<00:01:01.610> do<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.030> do<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.210> side-by-side

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
we're going to do is do a side-by-side

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.350 
we're going to do is do a side-by-side
comparison<00:01:03.220> these<00:01:04.220> are<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.520> same<00:01:04.759> fuel<00:01:05.119> we've

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
comparison these are the same fuel we've

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.300 
comparison these are the same fuel we've
added<00:01:05.539> to<00:01:05.810> two<00:01:05.960> different<00:01:06.350> tests<00:01:06.800> we're<00:01:07.130> going

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
added to two different tests we're going

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.080 
added to two different tests we're going
to<00:01:07.399> add<00:01:07.580> one<00:01:07.850> drop<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.090> water<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:10.490> test<00:01:10.880> on

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
to add one drop of water to this test on

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.700 
to add one drop of water to this test on
the<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:11.869> we<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.380> difference

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
the right so we can see the difference

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.000 
the right so we can see the difference
between<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:13.119> pass<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> fail<00:01:14.860> that's<00:01:15.860> a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
between a pass and a fail that's a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.530 
between a pass and a fail that's a
single<00:01:16.189> drop<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.520> water<00:01:16.880> about<00:01:17.270> 30

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540

and heating loan we're going to add our
water<00:01:38.630> indicating<00:01:39.259> solutions<00:01:39.799> make<00:01:40.400> sure

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
water indicating solutions make sure

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.550 
water indicating solutions make sure
these<00:01:40.759> are<00:01:41.000> mixed<00:01:41.570> up<00:01:41.780> well<00:01:42.020> give<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.259> little

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
these are mixed up well give a little

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.830 
these are mixed up well give a little
flick<00:01:42.799> enough<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.340> mix<00:01:44.210> when<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.509> get<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:44.750> to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
flick enough a mix when you get on to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.039 
flick enough a mix when you get on to
make<00:01:44.990> sure<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.259> solution<00:01:45.530> isn't<00:01:45.860> mixed<00:01:46.070> up

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
make sure the solution isn't mixed up

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.420 
make sure the solution isn't mixed up
and<00:01:48.049> add<00:01:48.320> those<00:01:48.439> directly<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.100> our<00:01:49.189> two

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
and add those directly to our two

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.300 
and add those directly to our two
samples

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:07.509 

and<00:01:52.909> then<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.090> write<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> cap<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.260> shake

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.519 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.180 

and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> look<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> color

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and then we're going to look for a color

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.240 
and then we're going to look for a color
change<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.709> indicating<00:02:13.709> solution<00:02:14.129> it

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
change in the indicating solution it

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.160 
change in the indicating solution it
turns<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:15.150> particles<00:02:15.840> floating<00:02:16.200> around<00:02:16.849> and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
turns to particles floating around and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.400 
turns to particles floating around and
as<00:02:19.970> these<00:02:20.970> indicators<00:02:21.540> pick<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:21.930> water<00:02:22.110> they

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
as these indicators pick up water they

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.190 
as these indicators pick up water they
start<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.799> turn<00:02:22.980> red<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.610> these<00:02:24.599> particles

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
start to turn red and these particles

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.559 
start to turn red and these particles
you<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:25.709> see<00:02:26.040> immediately<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.060> sample

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
you can see immediately in this sample

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.949 
you can see immediately in this sample
that<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.620> added<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.099> drop<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> single

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that we added the drop just a single

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.580 
that we added the drop just a single
drop<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> water<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.940> turning<00:02:33.450> very<00:02:33.480> red<00:02:33.840> you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
drop of water to is turning very red you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.640 
drop of water to is turning very red you
can<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.890> them<00:02:35.010> start<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> settle<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.500> so

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
can see them start to settle out and so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.350 
can see them start to settle out and so
here<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:37.980> samples<00:02:38.489> after<00:02:38.670> three<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.150> four

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
here are samples after three or four

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.190 
here are samples after three or four
minutes<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.530> clearly<00:02:40.829> see<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.400> red

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
minutes you can clearly see the red

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.539 
minutes you can clearly see the red
bring<00:02:43.200> at<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.440> bottom<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> sample<00:02:44.220> where

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
bring at the bottom of the sample where

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.199 
bring at the bottom of the sample where
the<00:02:44.640> water<00:02:44.819> was<00:02:45.030> added<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.849> see<00:02:51.090> it

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the water was added up so you can see it

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.860 
the water was added up so you can see it
there

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.100 

and<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.769> test<00:02:57.040> picks<00:02:57.370> up<00:02:57.660> water<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
and so this test picks up water and the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.500 
and so this test picks up water and the
range<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.590> no<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.610> detection<00:03:00.940> limits<00:03:01.390> are

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
range of no the detection limits are

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.550 
range of no the detection limits are
between<00:03:02.290> 200<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:02.800> 500<00:03:03.040> parts<00:03:03.580> per<00:03:03.790> million

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
between 200 and 500 parts per million

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.809 
between 200 and 500 parts per million
importantly<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:06.340> test<00:03:06.730> does<00:03:07.650> detect

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
importantly this test does detect

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.300 
importantly this test does detect
suspended<00:03:09.819> water<00:03:10.290> which<00:03:11.290> many<00:03:12.099> of<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
suspended water which many of the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.100 
suspended water which many of the
correct<00:03:12.549> methods<00:03:12.879> only<00:03:13.150> detect<00:03:13.510> water<00:03:13.750> that

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
correct methods only detect water that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.559 
correct methods only detect water that
has<00:03:14.230> settled<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> bottom<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:16.299> fuel

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
has settled out to the bottom of a fuel

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.839 
has settled out to the bottom of a fuel
sample<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.459> important

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
sample and this is very important

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.570 
sample and this is very important
because<00:03:18.970> biodiesel<00:03:19.900> tends<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.530> hold<00:03:20.920> water<00:03:21.220> up

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
because biodiesel tends to hold water up

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.119 
because biodiesel tends to hold water up
in<00:03:21.790> suspension<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.410> any<00:03:23.590> place<00:03:23.830> where<00:03:24.010> there

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
in suspension so any place where there

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.270 
in suspension so any place where there
are<00:03:24.250> biodiesel<00:03:24.879> blend<00:03:25.629> mandates<00:03:26.620> or<00:03:26.830> usage

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
are biodiesel blend mandates or usage

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.940 
are biodiesel blend mandates or usage
which<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.700> all<00:03:27.819> over<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.150> country<00:03:28.480> currently

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
which is all over the country currently

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.699 
which is all over the country currently
it's<00:03:29.950> important<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.489> able<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.700> test<00:03:30.910> for

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
it's important to be able to test for

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.100 
it's important to be able to test for
