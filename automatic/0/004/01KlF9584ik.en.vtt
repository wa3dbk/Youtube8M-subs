00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
start your head coaching career I think

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.250 
start your head coaching career I think
it<00:00:35.379> was<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.500> combination<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:36.220> a<00:00:36.340> lot<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.550> things

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it was a combination of a lot of things

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070 
it was a combination of a lot of things
first<00:00:38.260> off<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.680> community<00:00:39.190> here<00:00:39.809> people<00:00:40.809> here

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
first off the community here people here

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.810 
first off the community here people here
really<00:00:41.410> made<00:00:41.680> me<00:00:41.860> feel<00:00:41.890> special<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.610> feel

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
really made me feel special and feel

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.920 
really made me feel special and feel
like<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:44.830> program<00:00:45.160> will<00:00:45.280> be<00:00:45.430> supported<00:00:46.030> after

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
like the program will be supported after

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.720 
like the program will be supported after
meeting<00:00:47.110> some<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.620> players<00:00:47.860> they're

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
meeting some of the players they're

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.660 
meeting some of the players they're
really<00:00:48.970> excited<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:51.100> made<00:00:51.280> me<00:00:51.309> excited

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
really excited and that made me excited

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.009 
really excited and that made me excited
so<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.030> think<00:00:52.210> it's<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.360> combination<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:52.989> lot

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
so I think it's a combination of a lot

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.750 
so I think it's a combination of a lot
of<00:00:53.199> things<00:00:53.379> but<00:00:53.559> this<00:00:53.830> this<00:00:54.129> felt<00:00:54.430> like<00:00:54.489> home

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
of things but this this felt like home

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.460 
of things but this this felt like home
and<00:00:55.059> fell<00:00:55.269> in<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.510> great<00:00:55.839> place<00:00:56.110> for<00:00:56.350> me<00:00:56.440> to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
and fell in a great place for me to

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.799 
and fell in a great place for me to

have had great teachers so the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.969 
have had great teachers so the
background<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.570> my<00:01:19.900> coaching<00:01:20.440> career<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.770> it

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
background of my coaching career is it

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.429 
background of my coaching career is it
with<00:01:21.189> liberal<00:01:21.520> arts<00:01:21.729> schools<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:23.200> high

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
with liberal arts schools with high

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.200 
with liberal arts schools with high
academic<00:01:23.770> schools<00:01:24.460> with<00:01:24.700> high<00:01:24.729> achieving

academic schools with high achieving
people<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.979> think<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.759> combination<00:01:27.969> of

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
people and I think the combination of

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.080 
people and I think the combination of
all<00:01:28.539> those<00:01:28.719> experiences<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.729> bring<00:01:30.939> to

all those experiences when I bring to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.529 
all those experiences when I bring to
the<00:01:31.149> table<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.600> probably<00:01:32.200> pretty<00:01:32.350> varied<00:01:32.859> but

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
the table is probably pretty varied but

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.359 
the table is probably pretty varied but
you<00:01:34.539> know<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.659> think<00:01:34.780> Siena<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:36.009> great
