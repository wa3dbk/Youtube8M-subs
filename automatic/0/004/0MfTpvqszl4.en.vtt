00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.400
 Amorim welcome to another video brings 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.379
 today for you here another upgrade by 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 channel as you can see the fast pd 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.700
 I do not have much to say but one 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.889
 little on one day, right? 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 So, you see, I closed the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.680
 partnership with the store is job they sent 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.170
 the one between the first one entered 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760
 nor does it proclaim the professional vignette 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.519
 but asked to put it in the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 beginning and it was 37 seconds you 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.150
 complained a lot and so 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 But I appreciate the understanding of everyone. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100
 is that the final guys account 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.100
 understood well and according to the boy 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 there is this Tuesday tomorrow in this case 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.290
 It is already arriving this new internet is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.079
 10 seconds a new one between 10 seconds 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 What I 'm putting in the videos is not 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.120
 really should be there will stay 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 better then I wanted to talk even 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 You're watching some video 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 example here with this itajaÃ­ 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 but I think I 'm going to vote because it's just a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.449
 video de hoop de ti is one more thing 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.149
 folks 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.280
 so I guess I will not be able to put 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.340
 not maybe the boot at the end but it's there 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.260
 So, guys, is this relationship going? 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 this Tuesday even with the incoming 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.650
 gaga can rest assured that from 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.600
 From now on, it's going to be the new 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 over the channel is connected I like 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.490
 To do this is beneficial until I 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.530
 I'm working as you know Sunday. 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.150
 this Sunday of a I started to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.180
 work over the weekend in a 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.369
 restaurant near house there grasson 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.860

 get the 35 in an afternoon work 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.090
 It was the six hours of work I got. 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.520
 I think it was for less than that but three 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.409
 hours it was hard work and another treasure 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 there was more housekeeping and more light tassia 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.930
 but these three to hard work me 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 left everything broken including live 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.610
 motor vehicles validity of the law 9 or 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.039
 totally the rule, man, I'm just the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.470
 cloak of the harmonica I was taking things 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.120
 there from 10 to 20 loading it is 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.740
 unstoppable pataca 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 but this is it people on Sundays 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.120
 the lips are now Sunday and Saturday 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.390
 it is also because we are working in a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 Saturday is these variables if the work 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.980
 Saturday will be at night too. 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.530
 schedule I'll still see and on Sundays 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.120
 will also be staying for the 96 and will be only 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 one hour of it but does not have 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.780
 problem I can try to make noise 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.220
 during the week for you guys do not stay 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.440
 even on twitter on facebook for 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.630
 offsetting this will also bring more 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.550
 away for you because I'm going to 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.650
 number of pb videos on channel i 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.750
 I want to give you more space for facebook 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.120
 where what I'm playing quite a 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.390
 free to play very nice I did in cfa 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.480
 a game of the hour was that I enjoyed it and 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.180
 I want to carry on even having 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.920
 goals in the game and it's very cool right 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.480
 The game with the cool little gal then goes 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.320
 I'll bring cool videos there to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 you 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.260
 so I'm going to open an extra space for 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.640
 face 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.910
 In this case, I think I'm going to reduce 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.790
 pb videos for 3 a week is for one 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.340
 reason is that it's not just what I'm going to open 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.990
 more space for other games but 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.480
 also why recording with phelps is a 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.000
 It's too absurd to give too much pain 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.950
 head then the boy getting maybe 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.140
 upload some extra videos or not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 standard will now be three videos I will 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.410
 make some lives here and there with you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.120
 during the week when you're gone and you're going 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.940
 stay in this scheme and nelore dpb 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.620
 obviously it's dude now that I 'm 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.500
 taking this job with certainty that I 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.210
 I'll buy the full f4 the deluxe I already 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.580
 I was streaming to buy this month 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.890
 Coming and working, I'll buy the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.630
 deluxe and the premium version nÃ© 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.330
 the bfa four prizes and that will run in the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.380
 my pc because the pc runs or kuai o 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.630
 cruises 3 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.580
 then it will run the beautiful the end of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.080
 room even in the goal in the resolution 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.480
 maximum right 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.030
 but that does not have to decrease the resolution 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.860
 and boot in the middle do not know how it will be but 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.440
 will run pf four will run like this on 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.950
 pc my board holds a region 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.800
 very good 750 does not disappoint but that's it 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.900
 So people are going to stay in this scheme and the 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.320
 channel will now give this reduced new 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.060
 people will arrive and cartoons that are 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.979
 passing in the young want to talk about the cage 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.810
 that mascara shop is very good it still has 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.729
 a lot of cool even this week 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.389
 come back and send a very cool item to 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.400

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.539
 For you, that 's one thing I stayed for. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.009
 curious ne 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.020
 then when the changes also go 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.639
 Kill the curiosity about how it goes 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.990
 this piece only waits for one more 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.990
 Very cool thing, I want to make it to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.479

 something simple even there for you will only have 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.349

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.169

 where my team was taking leather and will 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.300

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.560

 very fucking pounds with him my gave to 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.139
 detention is a shock and let's say 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.840
 so he does not see that I'm going to 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.370
 end of the gameplay is well detailed for 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.099

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:52.550
