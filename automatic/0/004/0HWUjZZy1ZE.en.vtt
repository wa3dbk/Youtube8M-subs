 Hi, I'm Alejandro Carbajal. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.740
 dotcom muscles in this video I'm going to 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.660
 reveal you 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.030
 the types of foods that have the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.740
 best proteins and carbohydrates 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.970
 that help increase the mass 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.130
 muscular quickly 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.349
 some are invented with the idea of 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 that eating too much nullifies your efforts 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.759
 of training while others do not 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.829
 they are sure of what is the best 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.739
 healthy eating to develop 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.960
 more muscle mass without good food 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.370
 it is impossible to see the best results 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.440
 of your training a proper diet 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.690
 determines the body's muscle mass if 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.390
 you eat well you will be prepared and fit

 Diet and exercise are equally 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.690
 important 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.960
 a diet to gain muscle varies from a 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.780
 individual to another if a person has 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.550
 overweight is better before putting together 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.070
 implement a feed for 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.409
 eliminate fat before dedicating 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.810
 full to develop muscle mass 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.539
 on the other hand for a person who does not 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.189
 is overweight it is necessary to provide 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.500
 of a diet with enough 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.469
 calories so that the body can 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.780
 gain muscle three basic elements 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.750
 are required to be present in the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.049
 human body these are the proteins 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.000
 carbohydrates and fats feeding 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.920
 protein rich is known as the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.920
 better way to develop more mass 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.349
 muscle is used by people 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.629
 who want to build their muscles 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:38.759
 quickly the human body in effect 

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:41.759
 you need a lot of proteins 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.069
 protein- rich foods is 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.469
 better eat them during breakfast and for 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.450

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.879
 repair yourself while you are in

 Rest is also ideal to take proteins 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:59.579
 in each meal one gram of protein per 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.409
 kilogram of body weight is the intake of 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.959
 protein most recommended for 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.060
 healthy adults feeding that 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.979
 contains rich percentages of proteins 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.970
 to develop more muscle mass 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.030
 is chicken breasts turkey breast 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.870
 lean meats and beef meats fish 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 eggs beans nuts and milk the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650
 carbohydrates are also a 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.980
 essential element in your diet 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.349
 to develop muscle mass these 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.590
 carbohydrates break down sugar 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.450
 in the blood that the body needs a 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.430
 source to energy the absence of 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.170
 carbohydrates in the body causes 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.269
 the system does not produce insulin 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.549
 necessary for the transport of 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.890
 proteins therefore affects the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.530
 muscle growth in other words 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.810
 carbohydrates and proteins should 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.060
 work together the foods rich in 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.200
 carbohydrates include potatoes 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.760
 oatmeal green leafy vegetable beans 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.010
 bread pasta and cereals 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.620
 put these tips into practice in your 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.440
 daily feeding to develop more 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.270
