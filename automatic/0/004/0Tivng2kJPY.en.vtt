00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.320

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.200

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.540

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:27.479
 Again they flew very far to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.260
 the area where the land with snow 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.740

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.289

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.039
 Bauer farmer you can hear me 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.119
 The farmer looked up and folded 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:03.929
 his hands god you have my angel 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.459
 An old woman walks alone on the street 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 behind them take you in his 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.240
 the horse continued happily it was yes 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.240
 not ready until the village 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.020
 nils and the eagle saw something from above 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.150
 happened farmer throws that almost off the car 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.860
 hide underneath and stay out 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.860
 until the old woman got help 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.459
 the wolves were evil and hungry but that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.459
 Fass resisted 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.799
 People with guns came from the village 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.870
 run 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.590
 It was high time the life of the father 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.590
 was in danger 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.200
 two children came with the inhabitants from 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.730
 village ran 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.340
 a resident of the village warned the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.879
 children that's too dangerous looks what 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.879
 happened over there 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.850
 The villagers laughed at it like that 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.380
 Bauer the wolves had tricked the 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.680
 children were just as happy 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.970
 and then they had an idea 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.140
 took the shortcut over the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.209
 frozen lakes 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.200
 This is what the children noticed as they crossed over 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.750
 to look at the ice 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.260
 the ice is thin it will not be 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.260
 hold 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.490
 the ice breaks but do not be afraid i 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.490

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.590

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:17.229
 stop stop 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:19.659

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.770
 times in his life so nils sad that 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.800
 he never interacts with other children 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.840
 He has certainly made friends now 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.080

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.919
 gorgon arrived for a few more hours 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.789
 nils on a lake where a pig 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.180
 Wild geese guest had to 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.400

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.949
 the eagle had not forgotten that he 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.180
 himself with the leader of the swarm in the 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.280
 had separated 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.160

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.250
 No friends can be as nice 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.000
