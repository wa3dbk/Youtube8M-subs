00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
before this whole footage I can find I

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.570 
before this whole footage I can find I
did<00:01:48.369> research<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:49.149> read<00:01:49.300> statistics<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.259> I

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
did research I read statistics and I

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.040 
did research I read statistics and I
discovered<00:01:51.580> how<00:01:51.940> knife<00:01:52.240> assaults<00:01:52.660> actually

discovered how knife assaults actually
occur<00:01:53.259> how<00:01:53.440> does<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> realistic<00:01:54.310> knife<00:01:54.550> assault

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
occur how does a realistic knife assault

does the attack occur at do they
brandish<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.520> knife<00:02:00.670> do<00:02:00.940> they<00:02:01.090> not<00:02:01.390> brandish

brandish the knife do they not brandish
the<00:02:01.989> knife<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:04.030> they<00:02:04.149> grab<00:02:04.330> hold<00:02:04.569> of<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.359 
victim or they in a confined space right
now<00:02:07.119> open<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:08.500> looked<00:02:09.069> at<00:02:09.160> all<00:02:09.250> these

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
now open so I looked at all these

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.710 
now open so I looked at all these
different<00:02:09.429> knife<00:02:09.789> assaults<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.239> did<00:02:10.420> research

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
different knife assaults I did research

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.650 
different knife assaults I did research
and<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.050> found<00:02:11.500> how<00:02:12.459> statistically<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> knife

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and I found how statistically a knife

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.589 
and I found how statistically a knife
assault<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.260> likely<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.920> occur<00:02:15.340> which<00:02:15.760> happens

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
assault is likely to occur which happens

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.300 
assault is likely to occur which happens
to<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.840> very<00:02:17.050> different<00:02:17.349> from<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.130> knife

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
to be very different from the knife

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.820 
to be very different from the knife
assaulted<00:02:19.020> most<00:02:20.020> martial<00:02:20.380> arts<00:02:20.560> practice

some<00:02:40.510> goes<00:02:40.900> down<00:02:42.240> then<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.330> train<00:02:43.630> my<00:02:43.810> group<00:02:44.050> to

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
some goes down then I train my group to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.740 
some goes down then I train my group to
emulate<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> style<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.520> assault<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.210> train

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
emulate the style of assault I train

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.590 
emulate the style of assault I train
them<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.290> attack<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> manner<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.970> we

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
them to attack in the manner that we

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.500 
them to attack in the manner that we
would<00:02:49.960> were<00:02:50.200> seeing<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.830> these<00:02:50.980> videos<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:52.450> I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
would were seeing in these videos and I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.180 
would were seeing in these videos and I
got<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> proficient<00:02:53.140> at<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.830> they<00:02:54.040> could

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
got a proficient at it so they could

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.610 
got a proficient at it so they could
attack<00:02:54.490> at<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.760> same<00:02:54.970> range<00:02:55.300> same<00:02:56.110> techniques

throat in the knife assaults that
occurred<00:03:22.420> from<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.690> front<00:03:22.930> which<00:03:23.080> is<00:03:23.709> what<00:03:23.980> we

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
occurred from the front which is what we

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.080 
occurred from the front which is what we
were<00:03:24.220> testing<00:03:24.670> against<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:27.340> was<00:03:27.790> able

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
were testing against and so I was able

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.690 
were testing against and so I was able
to<00:03:28.330> put<00:03:29.290> these<00:03:29.560> people<00:03:29.770> from<00:03:30.100> diverse

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
to put these people from diverse

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.470 
to put these people from diverse
backgrounds<00:03:31.470> into<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.590> situation<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.520> have

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
backgrounds into this situation and have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
them attacked and the first thing I did

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.210 
them attacked and the first thing I did
was<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:36.910> asked<00:03:37.690> them<00:03:37.840> use<00:03:38.800> your<00:03:38.980> training

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
was I just asked them use your training

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.430 
was I just asked them use your training
respond<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.180> assault<00:03:40.540> let's<00:03:40.930> see<00:03:41.140> what

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
respond to this assault let's see what

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.500 
respond to this assault let's see what
the<00:03:41.620> survivability<00:03:42.520> rate<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:46.390> was

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
the survivability rate is and it was

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:58.050 
the survivability rate is and it was
less<00:03:46.660> than<00:03:46.840> 10%

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:08.140 

time<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.100> rare<00:04:07.310> instances<00:04:07.820> that<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
time in the rare instances that the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.410 
time in the rare instances that the
person<00:04:08.630> was<00:04:08.870> able<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.910> somewhat<00:04:10.910> fend<00:04:11.210> off<00:04:11.360> a

person was able to somewhat fend off a
knife<00:04:11.690> assault<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.380> was<00:04:12.740> usually<00:04:13.100> because

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
knife assault it was usually because

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.770 
knife assault it was usually because
somewhere<00:04:13.760> during<00:04:14.060> this<00:04:14.180> all<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.510> attacker

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
somewhere during this all the attacker

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.840 
somewhere during this all the attacker
dropped<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.230> knife<00:04:16.930> what<00:04:17.930> actually<00:04:18.850> yielded

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
dropped the knife what actually yielded

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.830 
dropped the knife what actually yielded
better<00:04:20.180> results<00:04:21.340> was<00:04:22.340> putting<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.360> priority

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
better results was putting the priority

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.290 
better results was putting the priority
on<00:04:23.960> escaping<00:04:24.380> what<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:25.460> found<00:04:25.670> was<00:04:26.090> in

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
on escaping what we found was in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.220 
on escaping what we found was in
situations<00:04:29.300> where<00:04:29.419> we<00:04:29.450> were<00:04:29.630> trying<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.960> stay

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
situations where we were trying to stay

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.300 
situations where we were trying to stay
in<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.470> pocket<00:04:30.919> and<00:04:31.340> defend<00:04:32.150> or<00:04:32.390> disarm<00:04:33.310> every

instances where they were trying to
escape<00:04:41.050> they<00:04:42.050> were<00:04:42.110> generally<00:04:42.440> able<00:04:42.710> to

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
escape they were generally able to

after that we decided to go back and

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.770 
after that we decided to go back and
examine<00:04:53.270> specific<00:04:54.080> knife<00:04:54.830> techniques

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
