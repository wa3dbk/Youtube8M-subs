alright<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.589> latest<00:00:01.829> sweet

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
alright this is my latest sweet

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.300 
alright this is my latest sweet
instrument<00:00:02.760> ban<00:00:03.030> it's<00:00:03.419> based<00:00:03.780> around<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.529> bold

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
instrument ban it's based around a bold

instrument<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> loosest<00:00:06.569> sense<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.799> this

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
instrument in the loosest sense so this

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.549 
instrument in the loosest sense so this
hand<00:00:08.730> injects<00:00:09.150> engine<00:00:09.480> system<00:00:09.900> like<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.320> boat

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
hand injects engine system like a boat

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.160 
hand injects engine system like a boat
would<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.370> hand<00:00:11.580> stairs<00:00:11.910> pitch<00:00:12.809> like

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
would and this hand stairs pitch like

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.189 
would and this hand stairs pitch like
say<00:00:13.860> pigeon<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.280> cello<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.080> only

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
say pigeon or cello and the only

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.170 
say pigeon or cello and the only
difference<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.100> say<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> regular

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
difference is is that say on a regular

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.939 
difference is is that say on a regular

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
bit of visual feedback so you can

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.270 
bit of visual feedback so you can
quickly<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:07.670> what<00:02:08.670> pitch<00:02:08.970> your<00:02:09.619> left<00:02:10.619> hand<00:02:10.860> is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
quickly see what pitch your left hand is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830 
quickly see what pitch your left hand is
that<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.150> first<00:02:12.660> learn

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
I've loved it in a few different

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.280 
I've loved it in a few different

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
instruments and getting more and more

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.879 
instruments and getting more and more
intense<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.690> put<00:02:34.380> more<00:02:34.410> energy<00:02:34.650> into

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
intense and as you put more energy into

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.960 
intense and as you put more energy into
this<00:02:35.220> controller<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:38.130> gets<00:02:38.280> further<00:02:38.670> up

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
this controller so it gets further up

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.240 
this controller so it gets further up

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the kind of intensity waveforms that's

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.740 
the kind of intensity waveforms that's
playing<00:02:41.400> grains<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.850> more<00:02:42.030> intense<00:02:42.359> sections

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
playing grains for more intense sections

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.530 
playing grains for more intense sections
of<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.370> waveform<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.549> there's<00:02:45.299> also<00:02:45.389> an

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
of the waveform and there's also an

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.690 
of the waveform and there's also an
additive<00:02:45.920> synthesizer<00:02:46.920> which<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.340> providing

kind of little anomalies that kind of
creep<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.620> as<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.459> further<00:02:53.639> up<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.120> an

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
creep in as you get further up the an

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.960 
creep in as you get further up the an
energy<00:02:55.650> input<00:02:55.980> scales<00:02:56.340> much<00:02:56.639> like<00:02:56.819> with<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
energy input scales much like with a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.479 
energy input scales much like with a
real<00:02:57.150> instrument<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:59.040> there's<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.459> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
real instrument and there's a bit of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.860 
real instrument and there's a bit of
reverb<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.000> compression<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.690> there

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
reverb and compression going on there

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.500 
reverb and compression going on there
and<00:03:01.470> that's<00:03:02.010> pretty<00:03:02.609> much<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.120> demo

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and that's pretty much it for this demo

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.509 
and that's pretty much it for this demo
if<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.170> want<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.769> look<00:03:04.950> at<00:03:05.040> some<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> source

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
if you want to look at some the source

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.039 
if you want to look at some the source
code<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.000> find<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.329> out<00:03:06.389> wit<00:03:06.630> e<00:03:06.660> dot<00:03:06.840> net

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
code you can find it out wit e dot net

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.739 
code you can find it out wit e dot net
alright<00:03:07.440> thanks
