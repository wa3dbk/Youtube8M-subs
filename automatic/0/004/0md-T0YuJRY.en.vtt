00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.010
 to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.779
 very good two guys and welcome one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.019
 time more to the channel and well you know since 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.449
 I've been two days without uploading videos and this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 has a valid reason this is because I have 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.739
 been looking at the new iter they have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.800
 taken out in the jungle is worth to bring 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.690
 a guide and that will not go lost as 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.160
 there are a lot of people that are watching 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.420
 right now it's worth then 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 let's see how you are looking at the object 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.010
 is the one on the top right is the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.559
 ferral flame is called in English 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.400
 I think in Spanish it's the flare 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.400
 wild or something like this is the name 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.829
 good to which champions are good 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.559
 state in which they benefit most from 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.400
 them all the champions that are based 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.210
 in auto attacks they benefit a lot 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.600
 of right object is then worth according to the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 guide that I have brought you, let's see what 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.750
 is what they base what works best 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100
 worth the champion who also serves 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 Well, to begin with, how are you looking at 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.270
 yasuo comes in handy as it is based 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.520
 in auto attack and the cv also has 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.100
 base effects thing that also looks 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 benefited another of course to basic 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.560
 and vic 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.670
 and it benefits quite well because 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.289
 you know that the higher the passive 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.530
 has more damage since it goes every three of 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.050
 attack 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.790
 but 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.830
 I think the wii that I have in the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.650
 channel makes more effect worth has more 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.020
 damage that with this object according to 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.730
 tests that I have done, it is worth being able to prove it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.320
 you if you want to try is 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.030
 exactly like the wii that I 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.530
 I have in the channel but instead of having 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.500
 the object of jungle damage 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.570
 you put this object 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.080
 let's continue if you use by 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.290
 example a set in the jungle 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.210
 it can also come in handy since it's going to 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.940
 make a point each year 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.420
 accumulation that you have and for the last 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.220
 it's going to come pretty well come good 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.820
 if I am able to use renga because 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.680
 what a crap that has made a river with 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.640
 mcgregor network of usa opens the cube 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.610
 the garbage and throws the champion 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.569
 if I am able to use it you can 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.630
 try it because it will also come 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.720
 all right 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 as you see or helix in indiana or almost 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.750
 it's worth the isi diana are ap almost not based 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.240
 do not attack almost dead, it's worth it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.720
 an elite convoy 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.340
 let's bolivar him normally 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.830
 go back to tank but if you want 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.360
 put the object in fact does not come 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.170
 wrong since every auto attack 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.880
 It has the bite and it does a lot of damage 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.640
 it's your thing to try it 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.080
 he will also use it in the jungle 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.950
 also it comes pretty well and 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.470
 cuckoo heel is meat and week please 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.150
 if they are going to especially not worth it because if 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.230
 they are going to not be based on auto attacks they were going to 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.230
 is based on tanks 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.500
 that there are many people that I have when a 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.520
 boot was still a exhibit he was 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.290
 connected to the 12th or 14th minute that's not that 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.910
 can form and is the 40th minute not 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.390
 it appeared and over ugly and over we lost 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.790
 and I was going a 16 16 218 was a 16 6 18 and 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.840
 It gave me a lot of courage over this session 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:53.000
 as you see only has and now they illustrate us 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.890
 that ap juani tank ap karim are not based 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.340
 much the base attacks the more care more 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.340
 It's worth doing that because it 's self-attack 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.480
 so here villar vanilli yes 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.630
 same almost worth moncayo leasing is based 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.170
 in combos that for example vats and cups 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.160
 of qq bones like for example or Cuba 5 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.250
 basic bulltick or harvard or tank or 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.910
 paste it but to try and honestly 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.270
 I do not see it I see it pretty much 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.530
 I do not know what you want to try it equally 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.070
 goods and tammy with the passive that has 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.740
 but I personally do not recommend it 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.430
 at night and because we were going 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.730
 a basic vale 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.050
 very well because here of all this what 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.930
 only the jungle could really 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.510
 While this is a crime of basic cam 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.370
 so put it and if I'm not wrong the 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.130
 cus also makes basic effects I know 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.750
 that if I wanted to put it perfect then 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.970
 here from this shoot as I'm watching 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.850
 no one's worth it does not happen to you I have ivory 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.810
 I had a xxi feed with this object more 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.070
 that nothing because they are ap 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.540
 here can go also auto-attack 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.639
 so it's good enough for him now 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.889
 be in case you do 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.889
 with the phoenix with the flare oacu 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.590
 move around here we finally got what 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:23.410
 interesting 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:25.810
 30 mer warwick jacks and 24 olaf are seen 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.240
 very very much benefited from this object 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.640
 but very much very much what 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.560
 I say to be maybe a little less already 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.470
 that it is better to be one more tank day 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.150
 ok but the other three was the goal of 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.930
 his office to burst his mouth 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.990
 any enemy jungle 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.690
 well here and well you know that 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.580
 now we always drive because because 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.590
 with this object you can make a 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.860
 male easily single male 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.229
 at level 15 with this object five 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.750
 positions sheet the reign and the boot of 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.370
 it seems that there is already only one male as 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.460
 you want me to stay the same when I 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.460
 saw 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.750
 tion if not while the goal of 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.570
 word 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.460
 now my philosophy jungle will 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.480
 come well I've also seen that there 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.440
 people play twitch 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.940
 in the jungle I do not know if you do not usually see 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.380
 it's worth it so it's clear you do not usually 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.780
 see but it 's a champion that also 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.030
 play in the jungle so also the 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.980
 comes quite well very well then of 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.470
 here as you know chinchao el chinito 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.930
 our favorite is always always 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.870
 is varying since they have released this 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.970
 item why because it 's racism is that 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.340
 have a lot very much very much 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.470
 only with exit in the real answer that 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.230
 departure so he left without knowing how to play a 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:48.990
 joke think where you put everything makes 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:51.540
 a lot of damage and finally 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.830
 our colleague Chaco looks very 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.830
 benefited but very much very much 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.620
 very much 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.000
 well nothing this has been anything goes 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.560
 this object so you know and to whom 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.950
 champion put soles that champions do not 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.950
 get in 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.600
 thank you very much for watching the video what 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.850
 I feel for these two or three days of 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.470
 upload videos but it's that it costs in the 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.889
 bottom it costs to find the champions that 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.620
 better adapts an object when it comes out 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.449
 and nothing 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.190
 and I could listen to the girl and 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.699
 now if we see each other in the next video 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.699
 see you later
