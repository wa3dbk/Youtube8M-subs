 He lets the ball fall a little bit, the weight of the body passes, and what he is looking for is that the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.030

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.900
 track 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.250

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.130
 as low as possible the armed 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.390
 as if it were a warehouse on the right side without using the doll very much 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.490
 the goal but neither is it too cut and it's no more 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.050
 and it pushes a lot to go ahead of the case of huelva rafael with the orange

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.800
 and ready to go out and get quickly behind the ball 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.210
 to have shooting options despite the position where it is going to be able to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.250
 you want to change the address perfectly and you can go through all the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 body weight 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.800
 in the position of being when the female can comfortably execute a 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.030
 volley 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.440

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.999
 that offensive position that everyone wants when the network is 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.409

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.699
 feet of the player
