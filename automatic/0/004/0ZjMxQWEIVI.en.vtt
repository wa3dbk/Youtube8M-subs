00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
just switched to it and get a kill and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.010 
just switched to it and get a kill and
then<00:03:01.590> switch<00:03:01.800> back<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.820> mk14<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
then switch back but the mk14 I have a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.960 
then switch back but the mk14 I have a
bunch<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.410> these<00:03:04.530> I've<00:03:05.160> two<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.550> each<00:03:05.670> weapon

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
bunch of these I've two of each weapon

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.330 
bunch of these I've two of each weapon
so<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:06.480> pretty<00:03:06.720> cool<00:03:06.810> even<00:03:07.440> though<00:03:07.530> mk14

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
so that's pretty cool even though mk14

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.040 
so that's pretty cool even though mk14
is<00:03:08.520> probably<00:03:08.850> one<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.090> my<00:03:09.180> least<00:03:09.239> favorite

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
is probably one of my least favorite

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.750 
is probably one of my least favorite

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
