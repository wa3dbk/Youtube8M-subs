and<00:03:45.690> thus<00:03:46.170> ruined<00:03:46.620> modern<00:03:46.829> warfare<00:03:46.980> 3<00:03:47.160> but

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
and thus ruined modern warfare 3 but

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.090 
and thus ruined modern warfare 3 but
after<00:03:48.209> looking<00:03:48.420> at<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> perks<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.380> really

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
after looking at the perks I really

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.490 
after looking at the perks I really
don't<00:03:50.310> see<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.579> being<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.880> case<00:03:51.500> Infinity

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
don't see that being the case Infinity
