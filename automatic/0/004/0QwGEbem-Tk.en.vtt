shake it yeah give it a bit of
aggression<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.560> then<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.250> pull<00:04:45.400> off<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.639> the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
aggression and then you pull off to the

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.989 
aggression and then you pull off to the
a<00:04:45.760> strings<00:04:46.090> over

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:50.999 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.789 

and<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.779> third<00:04:52.049> fret<00:04:52.409> of<00:04:52.529> the<00:04:52.559> D<00:04:52.769> string

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:52.799 
and to the third fret of the D string

00:04:52.799 --> 00:05:09.510 
and to the third fret of the D string
and<00:04:54.860> then<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.919> pull<00:04:56.219> off<00:04:56.339> to<00:04:56.849> the<00:04:57.749> D<00:04:57.899> string

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.850 

so<00:05:10.520> after<00:05:10.730> that<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.810> do<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.320> same<00:05:15.530> rhythm<00:05:15.710> as

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
so after that you do the same rhythm as

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.520 
so after that you do the same rhythm as
you<00:05:15.950> did<00:05:16.100> before<00:05:16.160> on<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.490> d-string<00:05:20.440> like<00:05:21.440> you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
you did before on the d-string like you

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.939 
you did before on the d-string like you
did<00:05:21.650> up<00:05:21.770> here

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.350 

and<00:05:26.949> then<00:05:27.189> you<00:05:27.250> do<00:05:27.430> like<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:27.879> hammer-ons<00:05:28.270> and

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
and then you do like the hammer-ons and

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.850 
and then you do like the hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:05:28.449> you<00:05:28.780> did<00:05:28.930> up<00:05:29.020> here<00:05:29.229> but<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.710> whole

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
pull-offs you did up here but the whole

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.679 
pull-offs you did up here but the whole
thing<00:05:30.099> is<00:05:30.129> on<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.520> surface<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:31.060> each<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.360> the

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689 
thing is on the surface and each of the

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.020 
thing is on the surface and each of the
d-string

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:51.520 

so<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:43.259> fret

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.360 

then<00:05:52.530> you<00:05:52.650> hit<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.830> D<00:05:52.980> twice<00:05:53.220> and<00:05:54.320> then<00:05:55.370> will

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
then you hit the D twice and then will

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:05.370 
then you hit the D twice and then will
not<00:05:56.520> fallen<00:05:56.790> again

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:13.290 

let<00:06:06.160> up<00:06:06.280> and<00:06:06.400> then<00:06:07.060> you<00:06:07.240> pee<00:06:07.420> that

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.990 

just<00:06:14.300> twice<00:06:14.540> and<00:06:14.900> then<00:06:15.800> it<00:06:16.160> hits<00:06:16.580> too<00:06:16.790> cause

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
just twice and then it hits too cause

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.050 
just twice and then it hits too cause
these<00:06:17.360> boys<00:06:20.080> she's<00:06:21.080> really<00:06:21.380> easy<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:21.680> play

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
these boys she's really easy to play

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.700 
these boys she's really easy to play
basically<00:06:23.060> the<00:06:23.420> first<00:06:23.630> chord<00:06:23.870> you<00:06:24.170> take<00:06:24.380> your

another two chords and he kind of just
strums<00:07:06.210> away<00:07:07.100> so<00:07:08.100> the<00:07:08.729> whole<00:07:08.880> thing<00:07:09.090> sounds

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300
