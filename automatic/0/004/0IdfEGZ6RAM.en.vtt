00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.430
 mood what emotions before the concert 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.440
 wonderful wonderful best 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.360
 it is better not to imagine 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.570
 compose 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.830
 great question is remarkably incredible 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.029
 warm bright solar inspiring 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 inspirational giving meaning giving 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 thirst for a new day meaning give in general or 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.739
 We made our way just fine 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.190
 very fond of them that would not be necessary to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.309
 wash their hopes listeners paper him 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.590
 excitement before the concert but discuss our 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.449
 Vlad can not do the law just 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:55.890
 don't worry don't worry i sense too 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:57.600
 excitement like what's not really there 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.719
 I worry he when we know why we 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.340
 doing here and why we came here and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.739
 black color 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.360
 as far as I know which cycle to go second 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.580
 album 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 how are you preparing any difficulties 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.750
 on the contrary let's say the main difficulty is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 that how would we last month ride and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 so 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.110
 Yes, actually recorded in Kiev 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.520
 so a few kilometers interfere 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 to do it as I would like 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.110
 engage tightly therefore nothing 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.350
 talk about it even basically think 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.150
 we should still go to Russia 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.740
 do not tour the album do 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.210
 cleared any where you need to do it 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.890
 at home we’ll actually come make a 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.720
 how many songs are the martians of your band 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.720
 already a lot a lot 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.979
 enough for him to select on the album 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.979
 don't think so you can choose better but here 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.750
 this song is also good and it's a damn thing 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.660
 Natasha meat on the second album I already 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.270
 wrote 1 whole album like washi 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.100
 you can tell you all the same 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.430
 left it to myself but some 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.380
 time and actually wrote more songs 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.690
 the same probably already from new songs 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.510
 after new new and we already 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.180
 made up like a second album 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.030
 some people actually have enough songs 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.360
 consider your creativity a kind of papacy and 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.780
 report 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:32.310
 ok well done 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 know what we could do well 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.410
 I find out that Sofia Rotaru is real rock 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.690
 and dzhigurda shams alam 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.870
 regina and so he didn’t go all this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.700
 joke sorry guys you many 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.980
 nominate us such major musical 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.140
 contests for example last year were 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.080
 about pp 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.490
 then these when using a word and and 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.420
 the denomination unfortunately remained only 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.670
 nominations because why so because 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.260
 that let's say pregnancy is understandable 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.150
 that mother noggin admit much 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.400
 more interesting is better than us an artist in general 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.700
 principle music is shorter and on my body 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.380
 Dima Bilan much more interesting better 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.340
 I will try the guards choose my who we are 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.580
 Russia choose Dima Bilan and Max 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.530
 gentlemen probably someone else there wherever 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.350
 wins but it took was to each of these 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.840
 contests that we are still small and 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.430

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
 loves curry dima bilan but how about 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.450
 just the country is choosing everything honestly strongly 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.060

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.549

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.660

 copperfield became a great illusionist 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.430
 not because telling everyone secrets 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.250
 their tricks are actually a secret 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.560

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.940
 accept or not accept and see 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.470

 do westwood far focus on 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.330
 that this time the emphasis for precisely on 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.290
 the music they are here on this issue 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.030
 total popularity does not arise 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.810
 such 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:33.770
 popularity is still some sort of 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.630
 relevance and having some yes all 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.220
 such is permissible when fingers are in ears 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.919
 I 'll shoot you decide not to know what's wrong with this 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.410
 do it is already success success 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.960
 yes and if there are no fingers in the ears this is a problem 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.750
 but the music is still the most important yes 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:54.250

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:59.210
