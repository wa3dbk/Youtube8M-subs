00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello friends today we have information and 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.980
 so we go directly with the one 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.800
 has generated all this information that is 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.080
 the instagram user only 118 who 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.580
 is this user because it is fontaine or is 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.160
 person is who gives the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.460
 characterization the voice to franklin go 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.710
 is who is behind this character and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.419
 Well, publish this photograph with a 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.239
 legend that says a truth that has 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.809
 to be told me and my great friend 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.460
 cj ellipses many laughs and 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.820
 Well, this photograph can tell us 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.920
 enough things really hides many 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.250
 secrets and then we are going to divide the two 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.800
 things let's say we're going to split in two 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.930
 parts this picture we're going to take the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.960
 part that is behind is the part 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.780
 which serves as a background that is gta 5 and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.550
 then in the lower part of the arm 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.590
 cj right there we can see in the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.500
 franklin word but has this bet 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.540
 front property then then we can 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.360
 speculate a bit about it is about 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.550
 of a dlc of franklin zoom of the ssj a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 dlc of both where they are going to join where 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.140
 Maybe he'll tell us about a story that 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.400
 they have not talked to us but well this is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.200
 the first part of vÃ©lez wants 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.170
 mention the fund that is 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.380
 where we can really build the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.150
 franklin word and there is also like a 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.370
 part in the right arm of cj where 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.410
 is hiding more information is 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.980
 hiding other letters then there are 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.920
 let's also say that it is placed very 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.470
 strategically this character of sj 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 with the face from jota go the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.020
 photography is very special because here 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.970
 we see cj holding franklin and then 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 would not go unnoticed would be a 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.870
 very normal photography if there were not 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.910
 let's say the speculation that has already 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.190
 haunted on the internet has haunted 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.410
 many videos has been around in many 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.570
 forums that cj is probably the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.430
 father of franklin although many will say no 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.800
 he can not be franklin's father because 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.690
 one is caught clinton and the other johnson 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.000
 then there is no relationship of 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.070
 kinship by surnames however 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.170
 because you have to remember the antecedent 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.270
 cj criminal and the best for 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.760
 protect your child well yes 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.380
 there was some change in surnames 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.900
 is that prehistory and to which I do not 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.550
 I want to get very deep but good 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.130
 photography is the one that I wanted them 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.350
 present and see how it brings many 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.290
 background stuff brings many mysteries by 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.600
 there that this user presents us 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.940
 it is called only 118 which is font in what 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 he gives the voice to frankie and then he makes us 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.160
 think a lot of things but really what 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 yes we are sure of what yes 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.690
 we can say that we have the 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.240
 information is that rockstar is 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.370
 working on something very strong is 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.230
 working with this actor with font 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.570
 which is what gives life to franklin 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.220
 and then what is going to get it what can 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.020
 put in a dlc in story mode what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.270
 can even include why not in a 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.760
 dlc online let's not say that the options 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.130
 they are very open they are very diverse 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.080
 because pigeonhole it into a single tlc in 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.570
 story mode it may be that this 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.990
 character alike also do it in a 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.840
 online form but that's already the last 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.460
 word has rock star then then 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.970
 we will have to wait 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.220
 and see if they really appear there 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.570
 some very dear characters of the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.150
 passed or it was simply a troda dade 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.520
 it was a trola of only 118 of fontaine or 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.650
 that we will see in the future that is what 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.940
 What's up, may it be, this was all 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.940
 you say goodbye 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.870
 all right 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.650
 yes
