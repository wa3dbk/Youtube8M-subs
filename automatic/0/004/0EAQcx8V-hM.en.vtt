00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
you can kill people quickly when you

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.420

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
become infected where you can last long

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.069 
become infected where you can last long
time<00:01:22.579> you<00:01:22.700> see<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.119> round<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:23.600> lasted

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
time you see that the round it lasted

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.850 
time you see that the round it lasted
under<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.560> minute<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:26.170> very<00:01:27.170> quick<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.650> there's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
under a minute so very quick and there's

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.160 
under a minute so very quick and there's
three<00:01:28.070> rounds<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.549> game<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.869> could<00:01:30.049> get

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
three rounds to a game and you could get

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.069 
three rounds to a game and you could get
anywhere<00:01:30.500> between<00:01:30.619> 1000<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.549> 2000<00:01:32.210> points<00:01:32.420> for

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
anywhere between 1000 to 2000 points for

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.069 
anywhere between 1000 to 2000 points for
that<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.460> pretty<00:01:34.729> quick<00:01:35.390> ranking<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:35.930> I

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
that so it is pretty quick ranking up I

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.260 
that so it is pretty quick ranking up I
mean<00:01:36.320> other<00:01:36.530> game<00:01:36.770> modes<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.189> may<00:01:37.759> help<00:01:38.000> 1

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
to probably get close to 5000 but it

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.690 
to probably get close to 5000 but it
just<00:01:54.439> depends<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.040> how<00:01:55.219> good<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.520> are<00:01:55.640> doing

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.370 
just depends on how good you are doing
this<00:01:57.700> game<00:01:57.909> mode<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.719> i<00:01:58.810> would<00:01:59.020> say<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.350> to

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
this game mode is that i would say up to

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.380 
this game mode is that i would say up to
be<00:01:59.530> skilled<00:01:59.829> to<00:01:59.979> fight<00:02:00.130> at<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.909> really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
be skilled to fight at all it is really

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.059 
be skilled to fight at all it is really
just<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.750> matter<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.079> being<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:05.890> right

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
just a matter of being in the right

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.199 
just a matter of being in the right
place<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.759> point<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.359> shooting<00:02:07.750> gun<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:10.000> for

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
place and point and shooting gun as for

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.600 
place and point and shooting gun as for
the<00:02:10.269> game<00:02:10.420> mode<00:02:10.599> itself<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:11.230> kind<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.430> think

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the game mode itself I kind of think

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.160 
the game mode itself I kind of think
it's<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.879> little<00:02:12.970> overpowered<00:02:13.690> when<00:02:13.870> when

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it's a little overpowered when when

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's a little overpowered when when
you're<00:02:14.319> infected<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:16.090> can<00:02:16.239> choose<00:02:16.450> from

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
you're infected you can choose from

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.990 
you're infected you can choose from
three<00:02:16.989> classes<00:02:17.530> one<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.830> them<00:02:18.010> has<00:02:18.190> something

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
three classes one of them has something

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.570 
three classes one of them has something

called for us and in my personal opinion

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.539 
called for us and in my personal opinion
by<00:02:22.450> as<00:02:22.569> very<00:02:22.930> empowered<00:02:23.530> because<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.400> can

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549

just<00:02:24.580> press<00:02:24.879> it<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.299> then<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.379> can<00:02:26.560> hold<00:02:26.769> down

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
just press it and then you can hold down

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.960 
just press it and then you can hold down
RT<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.940> swing<00:02:28.150> your<00:02:28.299> sword<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.640> literally

RT to swing your sword and you literally

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.240 
RT to swing your sword and you literally
kill<00:02:31.269> anything<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:31.959> path

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
kill anything that's in your path

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
kill anything that's in your path
there's<00:02:33.250> nothing<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.849> anyone<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.630> do<00:02:34.840> it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
there's nothing that anyone can do it

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.479 
there's nothing that anyone can do it
all<00:02:35.519> get<00:02:36.519> off<00:02:36.610> topic<00:02:36.970> ever<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.450> mean<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.920> think

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
all get off topic ever I mean I I think

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.160 
all get off topic ever I mean I I think
it<00:02:39.549> was<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.700> sensitivity<00:02:40.239> that's<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.780> tried<00:02:41.019> to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it was a sensitivity that's I tried to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.080 
it was a sensitivity that's I tried to
look<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.470> shoot<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.160> was<00:02:42.610> never<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:42.940> line

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
look and shoot but I was never in line

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.030 
look and shoot but I was never in line
so<00:02:43.510> I'll<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:43.989> ultimately<00:02:44.230> sensitively

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
so I'll have to ultimately sensitively

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.550 
so I'll have to ultimately sensitively
and<00:02:45.519> let's<00:02:45.940> go<00:02:46.060> back<00:02:46.209> on<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.200> am<00:02:47.349> really
