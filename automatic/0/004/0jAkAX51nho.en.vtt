cosmetics brow kit I don't really use

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.120 
cosmetics brow kit I don't really use
the<00:03:02.890> wax<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.579> use<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.209> brown<00:03:07.019> powder<00:03:08.130> at

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.400 
the wax I just use the brown powder at
this<00:03:09.430> i<00:03:09.549> bought<00:03:09.760> ages<00:03:10.299> ago<00:03:10.420> its<00:03:10.840> last<00:03:11.139> me

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
this i bought ages ago its last me

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.229 
this i bought ages ago its last me
forever<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.750> mean<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.230> bought<00:03:14.500> that

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
forever so I mean I think I bought that

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.000 
forever so I mean I think I bought that
at<00:03:16.239> least<00:03:16.600> six<00:03:17.049> years<00:03:17.319> ago<00:03:19.560> see<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.590> bought<00:03:20.889> it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
at least six years ago see I bought it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.430 
at least six years ago see I bought it
before<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.340> was<00:03:21.549> with<00:03:21.579> my<00:03:22.019> with<00:03:23.019> my<00:03:23.170> boyfriend

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
before I was with my with my boyfriend

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.809 
before I was with my with my boyfriend
so<00:03:25.290> yeah<00:03:26.290> would<00:03:26.920> have<00:03:26.950> been<00:03:27.069> about<00:03:27.310> six<00:03:27.730> years

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
so yeah would have been about six years

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.610 
so yeah would have been about six years
ago<00:03:28.030> probably<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:30.549> don't<00:03:31.480> worry<00:03:31.630> i<00:03:31.780> will<00:03:31.959> go

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
ago probably and don't worry i will go

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.860 
ago probably and don't worry i will go
over<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:33.130> with<00:03:33.310> my<00:03:33.459> powder<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.299> brush<00:03:34.720> that

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
over just with my powder the brush that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.509 
over just with my powder the brush that
I<00:03:34.959> used<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.380> apply<00:03:35.560> my<00:03:35.620> powder<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:37.480> kids<00:03:37.750> um<00:03:38.519> it

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
I used to apply my powder the kids um it

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.520 
I used to apply my powder the kids um it
just<00:03:39.549> makes<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.030> look<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.420> little<00:03:40.690> more<00:03:40.840> natural

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
just makes it look a little more natural

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.949 
just makes it look a little more natural
when<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.430> finished<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:45.269> kind<00:03:46.269> of<00:03:46.329> just<00:03:46.510> smudge<00:03:46.810> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
when I finished I kind of just smudge it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.640 
when I finished I kind of just smudge it
out

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.890 

some<00:03:51.650> days<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.160> don't<00:03:52.760> do<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:56.300> step<00:03:56.660> but

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
some days I don't do this this step but

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.800 
some days I don't do this this step but
I<00:03:57.050> think<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:59.570> kind<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.050> helps<00:04:00.650> if<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:00.890> do<00:04:01.810> because

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
I think it kind of helps if I do because

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.530 
I think it kind of helps if I do because
for<00:04:03.140> my<00:04:03.260> hair<00:04:03.560> color<00:04:03.860> my<00:04:04.310> eyebrows<00:04:04.730> are<00:04:04.940> quite

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
for my hair color my eyebrows are quite

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.460 
for my hair color my eyebrows are quite

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
going to get the leftovers I guess off

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.150 
going to get the leftovers I guess off
the<00:04:12.950> end<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.370> powder<00:04:13.750> brush<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.080> just<00:04:15.950> go

left so you know considering that I'm

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.759 
left so you know considering that I'm
kind<00:05:57.149> of<00:05:57.239> not<00:05:57.389> normally<00:05:58.079> I'd<00:05:58.199> be<00:05:58.379> a<00:05:58.409> lot<00:05:58.589> faster

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:58.769 
kind of not normally I'd be a lot faster

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:01.489 
kind of not normally I'd be a lot faster
than<00:05:59.129> that<00:05:59.339> um<00:05:59.839> it's<00:06:00.839> just<00:06:00.929> with<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.259> talking

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:01.499 
than that um it's just with the talking

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.100 
than that um it's just with the talking
it<00:06:01.769> takes<00:06:01.979> a<00:06:02.099> little<00:06:02.219> bit<00:06:02.369> longer<00:06:02.779> but<00:06:03.779> that's

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
it takes a little bit longer but that's

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.019 
it takes a little bit longer but that's
that's<00:06:04.439> really<00:06:04.619> good<00:06:04.919> that's<00:06:05.069> what<00:06:05.249> I<00:06:05.399> do<00:06:05.519> on<00:06:05.969> a

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
that's really good that's what I do on a

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:07.939 
that's really good that's what I do on a
daily<00:06:06.269> basis<00:06:06.839> it's<00:06:07.049> actually<00:06:07.139> bit<00:06:07.469> more<00:06:07.739> than

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
daily basis it's actually bit more than

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.809 
daily basis it's actually bit more than
