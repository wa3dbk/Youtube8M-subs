00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
definite layer good layer of protection

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.380 
definite layer good layer of protection
so<00:01:59.130> first<00:01:59.790> thing<00:01:59.880> we're<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.270> is

the same thing make sure there's no
specs<00:02:13.269> or<00:02:13.569> particles<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.459> lot

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
specs or particles because it's a lot

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.030 
specs or particles because it's a lot
harder<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.209> take<00:02:16.659> those<00:02:16.900> dust<00:02:17.230> particles<00:02:17.739> out

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
harder to take those dust particles out

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.680 
harder to take those dust particles out
with<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.640> glass<00:02:18.819> room<00:02:19.030> productor<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.599> you

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
with the glass room productor so you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570 
with the glass room productor so you
want<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.930> make<00:02:20.049> sure<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.980> as<00:02:21.099> much<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.459> them

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
want to make sure get as much of them

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930 
want to make sure get as much of them
off<00:02:21.849> as<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.360> can<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.190> we'll<00:02:24.190> take<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.489> actual

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
off as you can and we'll take the actual

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.789 
off as you can and we'll take the actual
screen<00:02:25.299> protector<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.049> some<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.590> them<00:02:26.680> will

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
screen protector so some of them will

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.039 
screen protector so some of them will
have<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.280> piece<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.180> front<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.599> back<00:02:28.750> this

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
have a piece on the front and back this

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.990 
have a piece on the front and back this
one<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.349> has<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> actual<00:02:30.430> sticky

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
one just has it on the actual sticky

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.690 
one just has it on the actual sticky
side<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.200> I'm<00:02:32.319> going<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.500> stick<00:02:33.010> take<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.549> off

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
side so I'm going to stick take that off

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.130 
side so I'm going to stick take that off
and<00:02:33.910> then<00:02:34.030> we're<00:02:34.150> going<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.330> position<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.930> on

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
and then we're going to position it on

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.270 
and then we're going to position it on
so<00:02:36.010> here<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:36.519> go<00:02:37.230> we'll<00:02:38.230> actually<00:02:38.379> take<00:02:38.950> this

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
so here we go we'll actually take this

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.059 
so here we go we'll actually take this
and<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:40.629> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> stand<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.470> from<00:02:41.739> where<00:02:41.920> I'm

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
and I'm going to stand up from where I'm

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.309 
and I'm going to stand up from where I'm
sitting<00:02:42.519> down<00:02:42.700> here<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.329> can<00:02:43.450> lean<00:02:43.810> over<00:02:43.840> so

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
sitting down here so I can lean over so

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.059 
sitting down here so I can lean over so
we<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.400> actually<00:02:45.579> put<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.510> down<00:02:46.959> slightly<00:02:47.590> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
we can actually put it down slightly and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.009 
we can actually put it down slightly and
then<00:02:48.610> we<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.650> kind<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.799> position<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.849> so<00:02:52.750> I'm

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
then we can kind of position it so I'm

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.289 
then we can kind of position it so I'm
just<00:02:53.079> gonna<00:02:53.410> look<00:02:53.709> over<00:02:54.010> here<00:02:54.489> hopefully<00:02:55.239> you

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
just gonna look over here hopefully you

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.210 
just gonna look over here hopefully you

this<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.299> there<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.019> go<00:02:59.049> we've<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.769> down<00:02:59.950> in

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
this so there we go we've got it down in

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.910 
this so there we go we've got it down in
position<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.910> then<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.870> actually<00:03:02.019> not<00:03:02.379> even

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
position and then it's actually not even

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.770 
position and then it's actually not even
though<00:03:03.129> it's<00:03:03.280> layered<00:03:03.549> on<00:03:03.730> there<00:03:03.970> now<00:03:04.180> when

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
though it's layered on there now when

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.930 
though it's layered on there now when
you<00:03:04.810> actually<00:03:05.290> push<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.650> down<00:03:06.129> in<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.549> center

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
you actually push it down in the center

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.880 
you actually push it down in the center
now<00:03:07.599> you<00:03:07.660> can<00:03:07.870> see<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.260> screen<00:03:08.470> backer<00:03:08.680> will

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
now you can see the screen backer will

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.500 
now you can see the screen backer will
kind<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.129> put<00:03:09.190> itself<00:03:09.609> on<00:03:09.879> once<00:03:10.180> you've<00:03:10.329> done

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
kind of put itself on once you've done

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.960 
kind of put itself on once you've done
that<00:03:10.569> there<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> go<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.099> kind<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.370> gets<00:03:12.849> all

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
that there you go so it kind of gets all

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.420 
that there you go so it kind of gets all
that<00:03:13.120> bubbling<00:03:13.569> out<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.799> now<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.129> kind<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that bubbling out and now it's kind of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.129 
that bubbling out and now it's kind of
set<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.849> place<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.420> then<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.660> just<00:03:16.870> kind<00:03:17.079> of

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
set in place and then you just kind of

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.520 
set in place and then you just kind of
wipe<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:19.120> push<00:03:19.359> down<00:03:19.389> so<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> adhesive

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
wipe and just push down so the adhesive

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.259 
wipe and just push down so the adhesive
just<00:03:20.799> sticks<00:03:21.040> down<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:21.730> it's<00:03:22.060> really

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
just sticks down but it's really

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.210 
just sticks down but it's really
honestly<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.959> easy<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.799> that's<00:03:24.069> all

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
honestly that easy like that that's all

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.099 
honestly that easy like that that's all
it<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.150> there<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.720> can<00:03:25.900> see
