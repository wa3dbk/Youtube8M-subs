00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the ability for Soraka to cast infused

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220 
the ability for Soraka to cast infused
on<00:03:17.340> herself<00:03:17.640> we<00:03:18.239> make<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.780> she<00:03:18.900> can't

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
on herself we make it so that she can't

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.810 
on herself we make it so that she can't
have<00:03:19.410> infinite<00:03:19.860> mana<00:03:20.010> anymore<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.670> therefore

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
have infinite mana anymore and therefore

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.640 
have infinite mana anymore and therefore
those<00:03:21.180> mana<00:03:21.390> costs<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.930> her<00:03:22.079> other<00:03:22.200> skills<00:03:22.530> are

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.470 
those mana costs on her other skills are
actually<00:03:22.799> meaningful<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.940> upside<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.269> this

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
actually meaningful the upside to this

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.240 
actually meaningful the upside to this
is<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.780> infuse<00:03:25.140> now<00:03:25.290> restores<00:03:25.709> more<00:03:26.010> mana

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
is that infuse now restores more mana

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.819 
is that infuse now restores more mana
