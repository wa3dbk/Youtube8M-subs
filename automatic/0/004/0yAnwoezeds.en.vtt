off now there's a lot of steam
underneath<00:01:32.710> there<00:01:32.860> still<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.369> it's<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> good

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
underneath there still so it's a good

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.969 
underneath there still so it's a good
idea<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:34.090> lift<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.660> paper<00:01:34.840> up<00:01:35.110> away<00:01:35.440> from<00:01:35.680> you

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
idea to lift the paper up away from you

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.350

so<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.250> steam<00:01:36.490> comes<00:01:36.790> up<00:01:37.000> away<00:01:37.479> from<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:39.360> we

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
so the steam comes up away from you we

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.700 
so the steam comes up away from you we
can<00:01:40.479> drop<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.780> back<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.259> water<00:01:41.440> if<00:01:41.680> we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
can drop that back in the water if we

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.070 
can drop that back in the water if we
wish<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:42.940> can<00:01:43.119> do<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.420> another<00:01:43.570> for
