00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 because the cup as it respects this 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.450

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.819

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.819
 enough 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.550
 this is fast this is easy and the only 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.750
 all you have to do is explain 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.640
 all 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.940
 and now the shrimp are already 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.550
 let's put here to put bastantitos 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.500
 this lack big cup but good as 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.440
 the parent effects can compare the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.220
 size that you like 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.720
 let's remove this now I'm going to put 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.010
 lemon to finish sewing 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.010
 while I put the other ingredients 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.600
 oh do not grab the juicer but hey 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.120
 with hand 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.340
 that are very small from the cups what 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.080
 I will put half a lemon also lemon 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.280
 It is to taste when they already have everything 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.280
 ready you can put more 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.370
 crazy 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.370
 let's put another one of the mole 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.069
 I'm going to make one with onion and one without 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.790
 onion because here we all do not like 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.049
 the onion and I'm going to do one and one 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.049
 it's half a lemon 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.980
 Now I'm going to put the onion in a 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.550
 time 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.470
 also to taste 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.100
 to these and already it is I'm not going to put 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.100
 onion 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.140
 well now I 'm going to put coriander a 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.140
 little cilantro 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.040
 also to taste 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.390
 I'm going to put you in pine 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.930
 let's put it like two teaspoons of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.930
 cucumber 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.819
 it gets a little more 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.230
 I will not put the avocado 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.230
 It's good 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.320
 and a teaspoon 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.230
 of chipotle chili to flavor 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 it's also to taste because this is a 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.580
 little spicy 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.580
 I'm going to put a teaspoon a little more 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.370
 and so he explains, we put more sauce 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:53.200
 and I'm going to put it in the east and shrimp 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.130
 pure shrimp cocktail the juice 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.130
 to taste too 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.160
 there is a little more 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.619
 I'm going to put some salt 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.800
 and we stir 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.819
 What else is missing that salsita so that 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.819
 It is a little hole dug 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.870
 This is Guadalajara but as I repeat it is a 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.879
 like everyone 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.960
 I bought, we already had it and this one 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:41.860
 I put it well and we have the mommy paper what 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.860
 I'm going to move 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.090
 it's small 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.160
 I already think it's ready here I'm missing 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.160
 a little more toy 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.960
 it's ready 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.780
 and so they need more lemon put more 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.020
 lemon and missing more salt with the motto salt 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.590
 and let's decorate with a lemon here 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.590
 above 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:30.180
 I see that this is easy and very fast and 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.790
 here we have the paper two medium very 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.210
 rich 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.900
 can see the Gauls I hope I think 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:42.050
 what they liked 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.050
