00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.690 

ran<00:00:00.299> outside<00:00:00.450> to<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:01.580> bag<00:00:02.810> it

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.700 
ran outside to a bag it

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.150 
ran outside to a bag it
okay<00:00:05.700> so<00:00:06.150> what<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:06.810> gonna<00:00:06.870> do<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.500> pour<00:00:07.830> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
okay so what we're gonna do is pour a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:23.540 
okay so what we're gonna do is pour a
little<00:00:08.610> bit<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.019> diet<00:00:10.019> coke<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:22.550> put

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
little bit of diet coke and then put

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:51.180 
little bit of diet coke and then put
this<00:00:23.699> top<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> bubbler<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.570> there<00:00:24.890> really

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:01.569 

okay<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:55.640> bag<00:00:56.030> is<00:00:56.420> going<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.230> slowly<00:01:00.579> fill

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
okay and the bag is going to slowly fill

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.800 
okay and the bag is going to slowly fill
up<00:01:01.760> because<00:01:02.440> there's<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.589> gasoline<00:01:04.190> form<00:01:04.810> so

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
up because there's a gasoline form so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:25.679 
up because there's a gasoline form so
this<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:07.240> chemical<00:01:08.240> change<00:01:10.720> it

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:38.069 

it<00:01:26.409> was<00:01:26.590> cold<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.450> balloon

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
it was cold like a balloon

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.999 
it was cold like a balloon
okay<00:01:38.409> so<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:40.149> way<00:01:40.329> this<00:01:40.600> worked<00:01:40.929> was<00:01:41.319> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
okay so the way this worked was the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.459 
okay so the way this worked was the
citric<00:01:42.640> acid<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:44.549> alka-seltzer<00:01:46.469> this

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
citric acid and alka-seltzer this

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.929 
citric acid and alka-seltzer this
reactant<00:01:48.009> is<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.189> longer<00:01:48.459> there's<00:01:48.729> also

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
reactant is the longer there's also

00:01:48.939 --> 00:02:06.310 
reactant is the longer there's also
sodium<00:01:49.829> bicarbonate<00:01:50.829> and<00:01:52.859> which<00:01:53.859> is<00:01:54.039> what

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:31.570 

we're<00:02:25.370> experienced<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.650> woman<00:02:29.040> aid<00:02:29.220> in

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
we're experienced this is a woman aid in

00:02:31.580 --> 00:03:36.890 
we're experienced this is a woman aid in
physical<00:02:32.580> change

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:04:40.200 

there<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.080> no

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:05:06.969 

you<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.389> see<00:04:41.630> all<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.930> bubbles<00:04:42.110> and<00:05:05.979> there

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
you can see all the bubbles and there

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.510 
you can see all the bubbles and there
was<00:05:07.130> no<00:05:07.310> chemical<00:05:07.849> reaction<00:05:07.970> involved<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.520> we

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
was no chemical reaction involved and we

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.339 
was no chemical reaction involved and we
can<00:05:10.789> do<00:05:11.060> this<00:05:11.300> back<00:05:11.539> to<00:05:11.690> its<00:05:11.750> original<00:05:11.900> state

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
can do this back to its original state

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:19.200 
can do this back to its original state
because<00:05:13.160> all<00:05:13.849> it<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.570> don't<00:05:15.160> repair

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:43.029 

so<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:21.169> is<00:05:21.379> still<00:05:21.729> doesn't<00:05:30.669> Rock<00:05:31.669> side<00:05:41.620> okay<00:05:42.650> so

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
so it is still doesn't Rock side okay so

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.399 
so it is still doesn't Rock side okay so
first<00:05:43.520> we're<00:05:43.759> going<00:05:43.879> to<00:05:43.970> add<00:05:44.509> two<00:05:44.900> ounces<00:05:44.930> of

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
first we're going to add two ounces of

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:57.879 
first we're going to add two ounces of
hydrogen<00:05:46.099> peroxide<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.819> this<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:57.500> then<00:05:57.710> and

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
hydrogen peroxide to this and then and

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:05.740 
hydrogen peroxide to this and then and
we're<00:05:58.099> going<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.610> forth<00:05:59.449> and<00:05:59.900> eat<00:06:04.719> and<00:06:05.719> then

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
we're going to forth and eat and then

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:21.420 
we're going to forth and eat and then
we're<00:06:06.020> going<00:06:06.139> you

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.180 

as<00:06:22.430> you've<00:06:22.730> been<00:06:22.760> seeing<00:06:23.470> the<00:06:24.470> baby's<00:06:24.860> doing

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
as you've been seeing the baby's doing

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.830 
as you've been seeing the baby's doing
bigger<00:06:26.470> she<00:06:27.470> kind<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:27.940> bubbles<00:06:28.940> are<00:06:29.330> forming

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
bigger she kind of bubbles are forming

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:49.770 
bigger she kind of bubbles are forming
you<00:06:38.440> can<00:06:39.440> tell<00:06:39.680> it<00:06:40.520> is<00:06:40.910> alright<00:06:41.510> so<00:06:42.460> that<00:06:43.460> was

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.540 

actually<00:06:50.780> between<00:06:51.170> hydrogen<00:06:51.620> peroxide<00:06:52.040> and

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
actually between hydrogen peroxide and

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.040 
actually between hydrogen peroxide and
we<00:06:52.610> need<00:06:52.820> and<00:06:54.700> himself<00:06:55.700> a<00:06:56.270> chemical<00:06:56.810> reaction

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
we need and himself a chemical reaction

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:04.990 
we need and himself a chemical reaction
because<00:06:57.770> it<00:06:57.800> is<00:06:58.070> bubbling<00:06:58.520> yeah<00:07:01.480> okay<00:07:03.340> yeah

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
because it is bubbling yeah okay yeah

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.360 
because it is bubbling yeah okay yeah
but<00:07:05.570> we're<00:07:06.260> also<00:07:06.410> going<00:07:06.650> to<00:07:06.710> look<00:07:06.830> is<00:07:06.980> eyes<00:07:07.130> to

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
but we're also going to look is eyes to

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:18.520 
but we're also going to look is eyes to
you<00:07:14.800> there's<00:07:15.800> the<00:07:16.100> ice<00:07:16.490> cube<00:07:16.850> it<00:07:17.780> and<00:07:17.840> melt<00:07:18.290> it

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
you there's the ice cube it and melt it

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.409 
you there's the ice cube it and melt it
is<00:07:18.740> really<00:07:19.100> small<00:07:19.400> so<00:07:19.790> you<00:07:19.880> can<00:07:19.910> tell<00:07:20.210> this<00:07:20.360> is

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419 
is really small so you can tell this is

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.720 
is really small so you can tell this is
also<00:07:20.780> a<00:07:20.810> chemical<00:07:21.020> reaction<00:07:21.500> because<00:07:21.980> there

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:22.730 
also a chemical reaction because there

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.429 
also a chemical reaction because there
me

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:24.439 
me

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:30.249 
me
so<00:07:25.659> that<00:07:26.659> it<00:07:27.529> also<00:07:28.719> fits<00:07:29.719> the<00:07:29.749> account<00:07:30.080> for

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:30.259 
so that it also fits the account for

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:31.629 
so that it also fits the account for
reaction<00:07:30.589> because<00:07:30.800> you<00:07:30.919> cannot<00:07:31.219> change<00:07:31.279> it

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 
reaction because you cannot change it

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.999 
reaction because you cannot change it
back<00:07:31.759> to<00:07:31.819> its<00:07:31.969> original<00:07:32.089> state<00:07:32.449> the<00:07:32.929> yeast<00:07:33.800> is

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009 
back to its original state the yeast is

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.919 
back to its original state the yeast is
all<00:07:34.219> dissolved<00:07:35.119> and<00:07:35.569> I've<00:07:36.139> even<00:07:36.289> brought<00:07:36.529> guys
