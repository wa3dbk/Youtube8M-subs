00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 my next video yes i have on 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.300
 my facebook page 2 something different 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.950
 but it still takes a while 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.079
 I work a little bit more 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.840
 think for it but also a bit 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.000
 better video what means better video 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 better you can say more elaborate 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 in any case you can already see it here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.610
 is a new product we have here 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 The stairs sign gaming box in clear 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 There are many different ones 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.670
 to dye 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.539
 I wanted to introduce you now 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.260
 I've already unpacked you once 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.780
 yes the box contains a total of 100 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.480
 cards with covers fit in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.960
 so here are the box I'll show you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 Grabmal I have my commander here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:12.270
 Coverage degree more convenient 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 wonderfully pure and even a whole 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.760
 place a little bit too 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:23.490
 sharp so you see 100 cards fit 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.520
 We perfectly pure what you have to the box 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.340
 she must be ingeniously adapted so the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.910
 exactly right there is no dust 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.770
 puzzle rhine will focus here 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.040
 so maybe it fits that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.330
 exactly because nothing really goes in there 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.200
 nothing comes to your cards yes what gives 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.010
 to say it yet 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.090
 the box she is very stable and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.680
 naturally optimally healed countries 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.630
 is growing well and you are now for 60 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 cards decks have I want the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 maybe the question fits naturally 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.690
 one can still wonderful time with pure 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 Of course, too 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.110
 but as said for commander or 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.260
 Highlander is wonderful 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.730
 unless you have an oversize squad the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.410
 Of course, there are quite a lot 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.840
 colors we now have colorless here 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.239
 is it here in yellow but once 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.470
 then it gives it green as if I were to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.069
 for example yellow and green I think so too 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.069
 a very strong color from the boxes 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.230
 then we have the box in red as well 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.670
 as you can see there are many colors 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.030
 if now discovered for example a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.599
 red 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.790
 or what is there now as an example 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.349
 some green think very many 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.180
 green creature still so is the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.719
 Of course wonderful is in the color 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.459
 right there I put my red bernbeck in it 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.459
 There are also the cards 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.250
 the box here in orange gives the box 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:56.180
 even in gold and transparent so 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.530
 bad you can then we have one 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.540
 mind until getting used to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.849
 but I also do not like color in purple 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.939
 I'm not so bad right now 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.109
 transparent, of course, like the orange 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.930
 you might see and you can see that 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:13.010
 me also interesting because the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.530
 a bit reflect box and yes 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.510
 Of course, for those who like it too 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.220
 she is also very funny in pink 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.500
 So you have a lot of them 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.919
 I have different leg grammar 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:30.169
 and because also travels can not it 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.819
 You really can not do anything for this 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.760
 you really do not say anything great 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.209
 I can only recommend you price 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.829
 are you already buying super product and 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.269
 now really the whole top protected 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.699
 the box is stable 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.900
 nothing happens with your cards 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:48.979
 Do not bump off anything and I have 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.319
 of course the video through again 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.400

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.260
 have regard to any strategies 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:14.959
 but it has questions regarding one 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.909
 swap regarding hey which intro pack 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.500

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.370
 just easier to write to them 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.680
 without that then the whole video should I 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.060
