 that in the mold in our rice 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.979

 quickie rice is made 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.550
 and it is something that will put Felix blog 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.900
 the vegetables that you want 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.900
 let's also put cream 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.219
 let's mix 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.770
 a little bit that's just to moisten 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 a little rice 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 we are going to add the cubes of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.990
 cheddar cheese that you can choose 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.869
 Maybe they like them better 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.079
 oaxaca el manchego the one you 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.819
 prefer this cheese they are going to add to 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.730
 I like this one because it plays a little 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.360
 with the colors between the broccoli your 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.850
 it is green rice that is white very 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.830
 Christmas 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.830
 now let's add the broccoli 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.170
 as well 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.030
 this this is that this is that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.030
 yellow 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.460
 but it may be the one you choose 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.580
 now let's put 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.270
 the mushroom sauce 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.820
 that is already sold 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.880
 This is already sold and if not then it is 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.450
 very easy can you put to boil 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.080
 a little cream mushroom and nothing else 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.570
 It's a matter of liquefying it, but this is not what 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.630
 does it add a little flavor 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.230
 different from the stew and the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.630
 Rice not always as you see 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.270
 He tastes different than others as well 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.870
 adds many amino acids and how 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.600
 we are like we are consuming here already 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.700
 carbohydrate so the vegetable does not 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.350
 broccoli which is an excellent vegetable and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.620
 especially for women have 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.420
 very much folic acid vitamins b that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.850
 are very important to take away the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.560
 depre and to control all our 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.600
 central nervous system then for the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 people who have Parkinson's that have a 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.710
 little tremor of broccoli consumption 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.020
 everyday can help to calm a 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.000
 little bit those nerve impulses like that is 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.230
 that is good to know we are going to also 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.970
 add the egg 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.970
 I 'm going to beat it a little here 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.190
 and this we are going to incorporate it so that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.190
 stick 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.280
 and ready 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.820
 the navel does not want to fall 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.210
 let's put some salt and 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.750
 Pepper 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.500
 to season 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.549
 and let's mix all this now 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.730
 obviously here you can put the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.620
 vegetables that want these stews to me 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.250
 I love them especially in this time of 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.720
 year because there are always too many vegetables 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.710
 always going to have to make a stew 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.600
 over another for 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.610
 I do not know how to take advantage of the rice that 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.550
 was and take advantage of the vegetables that 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.770
 they stayed and they did not and did not waste the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.630
 food because the food really does not 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.760
 must waste, you have to take advantage of 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:52.030
 we have it we are going to put this mixture in 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.180
 a refractory 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.810
 ah 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.460
 Y 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.690
 we are going to 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.690
 match a little with the spatula 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.980
 Now here with egg and cheese as 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.680
 a kind of cake is made 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.180
 kind of pudding in my cane is consumed 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.520
 a lot no more than they do it instead of with 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.260
 rice they make with pasta and you 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.689
 also at home they can do it with 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.839
 pasta 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.610
 and it looks great not with couscous, not because 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.680
 not stick well and then couscous and this 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.750
 half hard 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.160
 the little boy who is talking to me 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.009
 see what if with new couscous with couscous 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:41.270

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:46.180
 butter over and as well as the time what 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:49.600
 Let's put in the oven about 20 minutes 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.389
 We'll let doradito stay of 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.430
 up and we have a delicious here 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.740
 pudding that can accompany with the meat 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.509
