that's<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> thing<00:01:40.200> um

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's it is what it is kind of thing um

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's it is what it is kind of thing um
who<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> win<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.020> match

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
who I think is going to win this match

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
who I think is going to win this match
and<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.009> how<00:01:44.130> long<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> get

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and you know how long is it going to get

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
and you know how long is it going to get
like<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.479> said<00:01:45.659> earlier<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.259> like

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
like I said earlier is going to be like

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
like I said earlier is going to be like
a<00:01:46.439> spot<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.790> could

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a spot as I think but I think it could

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.200 
a spot as I think but I think it could
open<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.450> show<00:01:48.689> um<00:01:49.009> actually<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.490> we'll<00:01:51.060> see

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
open the show um actually so we'll see

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
open the show um actually so we'll see
how<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.360> goes<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.960> um<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> could

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
how that goes but um it you know I could

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730 
how that goes but um it you know I could
be<00:01:54.119> wrong<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.659> might<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:54.899> open<00:01:55.140> show<00:01:55.439> but

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
be wrong it might not open show but

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340 
be wrong it might not open show but
that's<00:01:56.159> my<00:01:56.340> guess<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.540> moment<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's my guess is at this moment that I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
that's my guess is at this moment that I
can<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> opening<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> show<00:01:59.909> should<00:02:00.540> only

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
can see the opening the show should only

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
can see the opening the show should only
see<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.079> else<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.409> open<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.310> be

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
see what else they could open with to be

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.800 
see what else they could open with to be
honest<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.000> uh<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.540> know<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.719> they

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
honest but uh I don't know if they

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
honest but uh I don't know if they
wanted<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.170> tag<00:02:04.409> match<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> preacher<00:02:05.430> match

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
wanted to tag match as a preacher match

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.249 
wanted to tag match as a preacher match
and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.000> open<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> ladder<00:02:06.689> match<00:02:06.899> but

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and then open with the ladder match but

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.050 
and then open with the ladder match but
I<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> feeling<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.429> could<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:09.030> could

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
I have a feeling they could they could

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.609 
I have a feeling they could they could
they<00:02:09.509> could<00:02:09.539> start<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> show<00:02:10.140> off<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.319> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
they could start the show off with it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.869 
they could start the show off with it
otherwise<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.129> really<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:11.730> would

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
otherwise I really don't know what would

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.140 
otherwise I really don't know what would
start<00:02:12.090> off<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> show<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.599> honest<00:02:12.870> but

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
start off the show to be honest but

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.880 
start off the show to be honest but
um<00:02:14.909> but<00:02:15.909> anyways<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> went<00:02:16.329> on<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> rant<00:02:16.890> anja

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
um but anyways I went on a rant anja

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.369 
um but anyways I went on a rant anja
with<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.189> but<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.970> think<00:02:19.299> that<00:02:19.360> um<00:02:19.750> this

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
with that but I just think that um this

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.440 
with that but I just think that um this
match<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.769> pointless<00:02:21.099> but<00:02:21.489> if<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.209> pick

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
match is pointless but if I have to pick

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.860 
match is pointless but if I have to pick
a<00:02:22.480> winner<00:02:22.780> because<00:02:23.170> obviously<00:02:23.650> um<00:02:24.870> someone's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
a winner because obviously um someone's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.539 
a winner because obviously um someone's
going<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.049> win<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.290> match<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.799> would<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.489> to

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
going to win this match I would like to

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.149 
going to win this match I would like to
see<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.879> course<00:02:28.060> Dolph<00:02:28.329> Ziggler<00:02:28.810> when<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.170> but

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
see of course Dolph Ziggler when it but

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.860 
see of course Dolph Ziggler when it but
he's<00:02:30.430> held<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:30.700> belt<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.450> kind<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.750> feel

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
he's held the belt so I kind of feel

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.890 
he's held the belt so I kind of feel
like<00:02:31.930> God<00:02:32.549> some<00:02:33.549> people<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.209> heard<00:02:34.390> said

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
like God some people have heard said

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390 
like God some people have heard said
Dean<00:02:35.079> Ambrose<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.530> personally<00:02:36.189> don't<00:02:36.280> think

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
Dean Ambrose I personally don't think

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.580 
Dean Ambrose I personally don't think
he's<00:02:36.579> going<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> win<00:02:36.939> it<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.689> don't<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.319> Wade

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
he's going to win it I don't think Wade

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.869 
he's going to win it I don't think Wade
Barrett<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.920> gonna<00:02:39.040> win<00:02:39.189> i<00:02:39.220> think<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.640> truths

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
Barrett is gonna win i think our truths

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.149 
Barrett is gonna win i think our truths
gonna<00:02:40.060> win<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.599> really<00:02:41.349> think<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.590> hope<00:02:41.829> I

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
gonna win it I really think I hope I

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.649 
gonna win it I really think I hope I
think<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.640> hope<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:43.060> it's<00:02:43.209> either<00:02:43.359> Daniel

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
think and hope that it's either Daniel

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.610 
think and hope that it's either Daniel
Bryan<00:02:43.900> or<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:46.599> course<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:46.930> boy<00:02:47.079> Dolph<00:02:47.290> Ziggler

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
Bryan or of course my boy Dolph Ziggler

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.699 
Bryan or of course my boy Dolph Ziggler
to<00:02:48.040> win<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.639> I<00:02:48.930> think<00:02:49.930> they<00:02:50.019> could<00:02:50.200> really

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
to win it so I think they could really

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.119 
to win it so I think they could really
rejuvenate<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.510> tag<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.230> tag<00:02:53.260> house<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
rejuvenate the tag the tag house the

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.710 
rejuvenate the tag the tag house the
Intercontinental<00:02:54.819> Championship<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.420> don't

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
Intercontinental Championship I don't

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.240 
Intercontinental Championship I don't
know<00:02:55.810> if<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.049> going<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.379> actually<00:02:56.560> happen<00:02:56.920> if

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
know if it's going to actually happen if

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.619 
know if it's going to actually happen if
they'll<00:02:57.430> be<00:02:57.549> allowed<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.329> because<00:02:58.420> it

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
they'll be allowed to do it because it

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.759 
they'll be allowed to do it because it
seems<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:58.840> nobody<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.349> trying<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.680> get

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
seems like nobody is trying to get

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.440 
seems like nobody is trying to get
people<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.040> notch<00:03:00.489> here<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:00.939> Dolph<00:03:01.150> Ziggler

they can have a reason to put him on the
card<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:19.660> should<00:03:19.840> shouldn't<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> have

a<00:03:20.829> reason<00:03:20.919> he's<00:03:21.340> clearly<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:21.849> most<00:03:21.940> over<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
a reason he's clearly the most over a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.640 
a reason he's clearly the most over a
guy<00:03:22.329> there<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.870> don't<00:03:23.199> know<00:03:23.260> why<00:03:23.379> they<00:03:23.530> had

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
guy there so I don't know why they had

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.189 
guy there so I don't know why they had
they<00:03:23.829> would<00:03:23.859> have<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.280> reason<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:25.199> but

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
they would have to have a reason but but

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.189 
they would have to have a reason but but
that<00:03:26.609> would<00:03:27.609> be<00:03:27.699> just<00:03:27.819> I'm<00:03:28.720> pretty<00:03:29.049> sure

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
that would be just I'm pretty sure

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.420 
that would be just I'm pretty sure
whatever<00:03:29.500> their<00:03:29.650> reasoning<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.099> it's<00:03:30.280> not

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
whatever their reasoning is it's not

logical shirts they just threw this

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.710

would only be I guess each one will be 3

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.659 
would only be I guess each one will be 3
and<00:04:07.599> 0<00:04:07.659> if<00:04:07.720> they<00:04:07.840> all<00:04:07.989> want<00:04:08.400> i'm<00:04:09.400> not<00:04:09.549> mistaken

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
i don't feel like figure it out but i

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.990 
i don't feel like figure it out but i
think<00:04:11.680> yeah<00:04:11.799> if<00:04:12.159> they<00:04:12.310> won<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.639> year<00:04:12.819> they'd

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
think yeah if they won this year they'd

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.059 
think yeah if they won this year they'd
all<00:04:13.120> be<00:04:13.239> through<00:04:13.419> you<00:04:13.479> know<00:04:13.629> um<00:04:13.889> because<00:04:14.889> i

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
all be through you know um because i

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.509 
all be through you know um because i

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
think was shield vs. 3 random guys / 29

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.779 
think was shield vs. 3 random guys / 29
and<00:04:18.970> then<00:04:19.199> 30<00:04:20.199> was<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:21.479> was<00:04:22.479> New<00:04:22.960> Age<00:04:23.080> Outlaws<00:04:23.229> so
