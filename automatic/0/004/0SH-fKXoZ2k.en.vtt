second-round<00:01:29.010> knockout<00:01:29.100> I'd<00:01:29.670> say<00:01:29.940> but<00:01:30.270> who

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
second-round knockout I'd say but who

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
heavyweight champion himself and I think

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.330

clearly needs despite to get back into
the<00:02:35.489> mix<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.849> light<00:02:36.000> heavyweight<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.690> think

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the mix at light heavyweight and I think

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.900 
the mix at light heavyweight and I think
