00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.970
 in Chapter 7 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.599
 wait for my words 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.599
 and keep within you and my commandments 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.710
 keep my commandments and live 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.120
 and to my right 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.680
 like the girl in your eyes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.310
 we abide by crimes 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 we write on the tablet of your heart 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.860
 wisdom said 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.650
 tourism 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.370
 and understanding 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.820
 mathew relative 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.780
 to keep the woman from driving 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 of the strange that comes up with words 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.780
 Why the window of my house? 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 per month of pregnancy looking error 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.700
 vineyard found out in which young people in what was growing judgment 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.790
 Querrey came down the street at the corner of the strange woman. 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.430
 on following the path of your house 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.920
 the afternoon of the day 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.400
 no twilight 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.420
 in the dark of night 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 in the premiere 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350
 This is what the rehearsal woman is. 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 I confess being a prostitute 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 and cunning and decoration 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.550
 is in love 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.210
 whose feet do not stop at home 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.219
 now it's out on the streets in the squares 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.450
 lurking by 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.610
 all the songs 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.930
 approached him and the bug could have indexes 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.139
 sacrifices had to offer 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.170
 I paid and today my votes 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.970
 left yesterday to meet you 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.440
 and I found you already covered by cheesy samir 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 fine linen from Egypt said 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.770
 I already called the moment as 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 to oblivion 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.889
 in a fraternal fight with the delights of love until the morning 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.339
 nice loves 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.239
 because my husband is not at home 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.719
 went on a trip 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.629
 took with him the loot has a finger 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.629
 only with the return of the light and will return home 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.429
 seduced with his many words 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.429
 with lessons jesus his lips and dragged him 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.470
 notwithstanding the following as boni that goes to the slaughterhouse 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.689
 right 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.369
 I ran to the network 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.389
 until the arrow goes through the heart 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.599
 like the ravi who rushes to the loop without knowing 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.579
 that it will cost you 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.369
 now, son 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.799
 daiane heard this is the time the words in my mouth 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.779
 do not earn your heart alone for her ways 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.779
 and not to waste your paths 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.219
 many of those who died for her 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.219
 your house goes to graves 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.389
 idc to dry 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389
 in the case of death 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.539
 clear 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.209
 the idea 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:46.019
 she
