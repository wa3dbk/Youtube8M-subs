00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.099
 Another market test we have here today 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 the europe euromaus 3 with it we will 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.549
 Today the green here of this 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 heap on the trailer invite 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.210
 We work only once we start 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.630
 first in the engine here we have that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 help panel charging table we can with 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.390
 the button iks open that is that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390
 she front 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.970
 from the level of detail I think that already 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.460
 You can see them well here, too 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.580
 Shock absorber okay here is one 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.770
 moved a bit 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.809
 and there does not matter 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 its too small details though 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 otherwise it is actually quite good 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.250
 That's how he looks from the inside 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.330
 ec so that here with the mouse what 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.890
 can do all the things 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:06.040
 theoretically we do not do it now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.549
 then we can arm in arm with y 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.549
 unfold 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.810
 why was it shaking now 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 get off briefly 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.540
 so before that was not so 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.260
 is the meat 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.130
 funny 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.149
 that sucks 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.149
 the gate 8 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 Shrovetide 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.960
 so 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.910
 Now we can move the arm here 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.910
 the main arm 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.640
 and with the key 9 we can do the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.640
 rear part moving up and down 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.490
 then stop that stop the poor 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:36.260
 the trailer fits that he puts on it 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.740
 equal to the last left 6 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 still is 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.940
 Now he finally has it 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.940
 captured 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.769
 9 and then we turn a bit 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.769
 to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.830
 then we start that all the time 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830
 can do now from 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.270
 and then we can go here 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.800
 is a bit 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.800
 to charge the trailer 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.870
 works quite well 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.700
 Of course we have several more here 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.319
 working judge once 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.319
 right left 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.260
 only that many here for this 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.760
 unload and for the front 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.560
 when really gives 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.920
 the toaster 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 2 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:40.000
 the tone 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.000
 left and right and left 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.470
 then we can sit in here the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.590
 we can also change 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:53.060
 we turn off the light so you push 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.220
 the button 0 and then we can with four 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.530
 and six bodies seen the seat so 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.300
 now pat four and six there we can 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.880
 then watch how it is loaded and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.380
 with completely fifth center the seat 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.380
 So here he is again 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.960
 there is still such a thing 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.960
 Steering can be changed 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.890
 that is enough we do not need completely 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.730
 make it full so we do this here 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.500
 away and then look at the steering wheel 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.010
 kinds so that's the rear axle 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.050
 these are then both called grand modus 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.350
 I believe that 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 then he just drives on himself 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.900
 Keep sideways to side laterally 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.360
 behind that then the front axle 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.750
 rear axle and both so and the weight 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.410
 I think I can also program 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.620
 Now select the counterweight button 7 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.140
 and then depending on where the poor 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.740
 is to use as a counterweight with the 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.880
 Do not get in trouble with five 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.480
 you can do it all again 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.480
 center 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:20.450
 Let's have a look at the loco 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.450
 be faultless as far as I know 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:34.130
 the lok is error free 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.130
 there you see the lamborghini 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.159
 and everything I'm still in here 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:43.750
 have well that is error-free and thus 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:47.310
 I say goodbye 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.310
 our job until next time
