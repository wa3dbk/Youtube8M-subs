00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
this slow far seems visa highest and I

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.950 
this slow far seems visa highest and I
on<00:06:19.320> to<00:06:19.650> netbook<00:06:20.100> out<00:06:20.310> there<00:06:20.700> even<00:06:21.390> one<00:06:21.780> of<00:06:21.810> the

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
on to netbook out there even one of the

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
you if you consider if you don't

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.440 
you if you consider if you don't
consider<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:28.340> m11<00:06:29.340> it<00:06:29.430> but<00:06:29.700> I<00:06:29.730> consider<00:06:30.240> that

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
consider the m11 it but I consider that

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.130 
consider the m11 it but I consider that
so<00:06:30.750> that<00:06:31.620> pretty<00:06:31.860> much<00:06:31.980> tops<00:06:32.370> everything<00:06:32.640> but

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
so that pretty much tops everything but

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.490 
so that pretty much tops everything but
this<00:06:34.640> is<00:06:35.640> pretty<00:06:36.060> is<00:06:36.390> a<00:06:36.600> pretty<00:06:36.930> good<00:06:37.169> computer

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500
