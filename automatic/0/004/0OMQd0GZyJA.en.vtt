utilize<00:01:40.439> Sony<00:01:40.799> intelligence<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:41.970> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
utilize Sony intelligence and kind of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760 
utilize Sony intelligence and kind of
identify<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> type<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> environment<00:01:43.380> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
identify the type of environment that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
identify the type of environment that
you're<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:45.060> enhance<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.170> you're

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you're in and really enhance what you're

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.990 
you're in and really enhance what you're
viewing<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.950> terms<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.490> whether<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
viewing in terms of whether you're

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.300 
viewing in terms of whether you're
viewing<00:01:48.240> folders<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.229> videos

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
viewing folders or videos

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
viewing folders or videos
and<00:01:50.580> just<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.300> makes<00:01:51.540> those<00:01:51.810> images<00:01:52.230> nice

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and just really makes those images nice

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.359 
and just really makes those images nice
and<00:01:52.800> clear

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.419 

so<00:01:55.880> that's<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.929> display<00:01:57.229> aspect<00:01:57.560> just

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
so that's the the display aspect just

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.340 
so that's the the display aspect just
kind<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.850> another<00:01:59.479> informational<00:02:00.109> piece

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
kind of a another informational piece

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.499 
kind of a another informational piece
it's<00:02:00.799> pretty<00:02:01.039> smooth<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.549> fast<00:02:01.820> because<00:02:02.390> it

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
it's pretty smooth and fast because it

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.209 
it's pretty smooth and fast because it
is<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.929> quad-core<00:02:03.229> processor

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
is a quad-core processor

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.569 
is a quad-core processor
it's<00:02:04.429> a<00:02:04.520> 1.5<00:02:05.090> gigahertz<00:02:05.439> Snapdragon<00:02:06.439> s4<00:02:07.039> pro

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
it's a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.969 
it's a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro
processor<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.660> again<00:02:08.929> very<00:02:08.959> fast<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.950> very

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
processor so again very fast and very

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.890 
processor so again very fast and very
smooth<00:02:10.489> then<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:11.180> let's<00:02:11.390> talk<00:02:11.540> about<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
smooth then now let's talk about the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.559 
smooth then now let's talk about the
camera<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.670> I'm<00:02:13.730> going<00:02:13.879> to<00:02:13.910> turn<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.180> over<00:02:14.239> here

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
camera so I'm going to turn it over here

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.770 
camera so I'm going to turn it over here
and<00:02:15.560> actually<00:02:15.739> here<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.760> primary<00:02:17.030> camera<00:02:17.629> is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and actually here the primary camera is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.979 
and actually here the primary camera is
a<00:02:18.080> 13<00:02:18.650> megapixel<00:02:19.430> camera<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:20.360> camera

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
a 13 megapixel camera the camera

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.110 
a 13 megapixel camera the camera
actually<00:02:21.160> utilizes<00:02:22.160> again<00:02:22.610> another<00:02:22.910> great

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
actually utilizes again another great

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.360 
actually utilizes again another great
piece<00:02:23.299> of<00:02:23.360> Sony<00:02:23.660> technology<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.890> Exmor

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
piece of Sony technology it's the Exmor

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.509 
piece of Sony technology it's the Exmor
RS<00:02:25.640> image<00:02:26.420> sensor<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.319> X<00:02:27.560> bar<00:02:27.799> RS<00:02:28.190> image

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
RS image sensor so the X bar RS image

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.520 
RS image sensor so the X bar RS image
sensor<00:02:28.940> actually<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.959> really<00:02:30.349> great

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
sensor actually the really great

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.470 
sensor actually the really great
benefits<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.280> will<00:02:31.459> allow<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.000> allows<00:02:32.299> you

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
benefits of it will allow it allows you

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.440 
benefits of it will allow it allows you
to<00:02:32.660> utilize<00:02:32.870> or<00:02:33.410> take<00:02:33.680> rather<00:02:33.920> HDR<00:02:34.610> photos<00:02:35.209> and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
to utilize or take rather HDR photos and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.410 
to utilize or take rather HDR photos and
videos<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.769> actually<00:02:37.250> one<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.549> one<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
videos it is actually one of one of the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
videos it is actually one of one of the
first<00:02:38.660> mobile<00:02:39.319> device<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.769> enables<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.400> to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
first mobile device that enables you to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.819 
first mobile device that enables you to
do<00:02:40.579> HDR<00:02:41.120> videos<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.930> when<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.230> take<00:02:42.410> HDR

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
do HDR videos and when you take HDR

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.229 
do HDR videos and when you take HDR
videos<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.310> actually<00:02:43.640> does<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.030> real<00:02:44.209> time

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
videos it actually does it in real time

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.479 
videos it actually does it in real time
so<00:02:44.660> there's<00:02:44.810> really<00:02:44.989> no<00:02:45.200> delay<00:02:45.530> once<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.040> take

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
so there's really no delay once you take

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.430 
so there's really no delay once you take
the<00:02:46.610> shot<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.329> or<00:02:47.480> take<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> video<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
the shot and then or take a video and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.199 
the shot and then or take a video and
then<00:02:48.860> I'll<00:02:48.980> try<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.220> watch<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.610> right<00:02:49.760> away

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
then I'll try to watch it right away

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.360 
then I'll try to watch it right away
and<00:02:50.870> what<00:02:51.140> superior<00:02:51.620> auto<00:02:51.739> mode<00:02:52.040> will<00:02:52.340> allow

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and what superior auto mode will allow

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.970 
and what superior auto mode will allow
you<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.879> do<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.360> again<00:02:53.690> another<00:02:53.930> piece<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.470> you

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
you to do is again another piece of you

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.069 
you to do is again another piece of you
know<00:02:55.099> intelligence<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.910> phone<00:02:56.090> depending

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
know intelligence on the phone depending

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.390 
know intelligence on the phone depending
on<00:02:57.170> what<00:02:57.319> you're<00:02:57.440> looking<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.040> as<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:58.250> see

again it's something where it's
automated<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.530> user<00:03:24.739> won't<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.430> or

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
automated so the user won't have to or

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.589 
automated so the user won't have to or
the<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.359> know

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
the you know

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.720 
the you know
yep<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.900> user<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:27.410> won't<00:03:27.950> have<00:03:28.099> to<00:03:28.220> manually

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
yep the user I won't have to manually

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.150 
yep the user I won't have to manually
change<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.209> modes<00:03:29.389> themselves<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.739> then<00:03:30.889> the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
change the modes themselves and then the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.569 
change the modes themselves and then the
last<00:03:31.370> piece<00:03:31.669> really<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.349> NFC<00:03:33.859> portion<00:03:34.280> so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
last piece really is the NFC portion so

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.990 
last piece really is the NFC portion so
I<00:03:34.880> am<00:03:35.180> actually<00:03:35.470> going<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.620> utilize<00:03:36.889> this<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
I am actually going to utilize this is a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.880 
I am actually going to utilize this is a
wonder<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.540> our<00:03:38.630> NFC<00:03:39.079> headset<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:39.769> when<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:39.980> tap

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.680 

it<00:03:44.430> gives<00:03:44.580> me<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> slight<00:03:45.000> vibration<00:03:45.150> it's

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
it gives me a slight vibration it's

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.510 
it gives me a slight vibration it's
double<00:03:46.230> confirming<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.980> wants<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> pair

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
double confirming that it wants to pair

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.460 
double confirming that it wants to pair
to<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> Bluetooth<00:03:47.880> device<00:03:48.140> tells<00:03:49.140> me<00:03:49.350> I'm

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
to a Bluetooth device tells me I'm

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.860 
to a Bluetooth device tells me I'm
pairing<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.220> it'll<00:03:50.850> basically<00:03:50.940> tell<00:03:51.390> me<00:03:51.569> that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
pairing and it'll basically tell me that

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.059 
pairing and it'll basically tell me that
it's<00:03:52.170> all<00:03:52.290> that's<00:03:52.590> good<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.920> go

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
it's all that's good to go

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.030 
it's all that's good to go
so<00:03:53.760> once<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.150> done<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.560> listen<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.980> your

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
so once it's done you can listen to your

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.850 
so once it's done you can listen to your
music<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.670> NFC<00:03:57.000> devices<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.900> Xperia<00:03:58.410> Z<00:03:58.650> is

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
music on the NFC devices the Xperia Z is

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.640 
music on the NFC devices the Xperia Z is
actually<00:03:59.180> water-resistant<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.170> ZL<00:04:01.620> is

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
actually water-resistant so the ZL is

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.310 
actually water-resistant so the ZL is
not<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:02.640> if<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.820> were<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.150> put<00:04:03.330> both<00:04:03.690> phones<00:04:03.959> in

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
not so if I were to put both phones in

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.930 
not so if I were to put both phones in
this<00:04:04.590> thing<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:05.010> which<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.310> will<00:04:05.459> not<00:04:05.610> do<00:04:05.790> with

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
this thing here which I will not do with

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.630 
this thing here which I will not do with
the<00:04:06.030> CL<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.200> easily<00:04:07.890> put<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.430> Z<00:04:08.610> on

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
the CL but I can easily put in the Z on

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.880 
the CL but I can easily put in the Z on
there<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.630> can<00:04:09.780> still<00:04:10.020> pull<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.260> out<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.560> long

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
there you can still pull it out a long

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.040 
there you can still pull it out a long
time<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.340> get<00:04:11.459> your<00:04:11.550> phone<00:04:11.700> back<00:04:11.730> yeah<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.900> can

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.890 

and<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.180> still<00:04:19.389> works<00:04:19.720> awesome

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
and it still works awesome

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.680 
and it still works awesome
on<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.560> door<00:04:21.739> here<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:22.100> has<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.660> microSD<00:04:23.660> slot

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
on the door here it has a microSD slot

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.750 
on the door here it has a microSD slot
card<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.500> actually<00:04:24.889> also<00:04:25.160> goes<00:04:25.340> for<00:04:25.370> the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
card and that actually also goes for the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.270 
card and that actually also goes for the
DL<00:04:26.090> as<00:04:26.270> well<00:04:26.449> so<00:04:27.110> it's<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.380> 16<00:04:27.860> gigs<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.190> internal

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
DL as well so it's a 16 gigs of internal

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.030 
DL as well so it's a 16 gigs of internal
memory<00:04:28.729> plus<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.720> microSD<00:04:29.750> expansion<00:04:30.680> slot

memory plus a microSD expansion slot
let's<00:04:31.639> not<00:04:31.760> forget<00:04:31.970> obviously<00:04:32.690> obviously<00:04:33.410> it

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
let's not forget obviously obviously it

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.920 
let's not forget obviously obviously it
just<00:04:33.800> 9.8<00:04:34.400> millimeters<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.150> thinness<00:04:35.449> yeah

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
just 9.8 millimeters the thinness yeah

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.180 
just 9.8 millimeters the thinness yeah
we're<00:04:36.229> looking<00:04:36.410> at<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.530> twenty<00:04:36.830> three<00:04:36.949> hundred

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
we're looking at a twenty three hundred

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.469 
we're looking at a twenty three hundred
million<00:04:37.340> battery<00:04:37.760> on<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.940> inside<00:04:38.270> which

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
million battery on the inside which

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.640 
million battery on the inside which
makes<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.870> larger<00:04:39.110> than<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.350> lot<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.500> his

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
makes it larger than a lot of his

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.939 
makes it larger than a lot of his
counterparts<00:04:40.190> at<00:04:40.699> its<00:04:40.880> size<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.800> then

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
counterparts at its size and then

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.560 
counterparts at its size and then
actually<00:04:43.250> speaking<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.669> battery<00:04:43.970> because<00:04:44.449> in

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
actually speaking of battery because in

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.390 
actually speaking of battery because in
addition<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.020> great<00:04:45.260> sized<00:04:45.470> battery<00:04:45.889> both

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
addition to a great sized battery both

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.300 
addition to a great sized battery both
devices<00:04:46.760> have<00:04:47.000> built<00:04:47.810> in<00:04:48.020> again<00:04:48.530> intelligence

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
devices have built in again intelligence

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.689 
devices have built in again intelligence
in<00:04:49.520> terms<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.440> battery<00:04:51.440> management<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.550> what

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
in terms of battery management so what

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.050 
in terms of battery management so what
we<00:04:52.820> have<00:04:53.030> here<00:04:53.060> is<00:04:53.510> let<00:04:54.410> me<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.680> quickly<00:04:55.060> we

we have here is let me just quickly we

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.700 
we have here is let me just quickly we
have<00:04:56.240> what's<00:04:56.419> called<00:04:56.539> battery<00:04:56.960> stamina<00:04:57.500> mode

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
have what's called battery stamina mode

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.680 
have what's called battery stamina mode
what<00:04:58.070> battery<00:04:58.430> stamina<00:04:58.669> mode<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.210> known<00:04:59.449> for

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
what battery stamina mode is known for

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.810 
what battery stamina mode is known for
is<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.139> can<00:05:00.289> actually<00:05:00.500> increase<00:05:00.830> your<00:05:01.190> standby

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
is it can actually increase your standby

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.939 
is it can actually increase your standby
time<00:05:02.030> for<00:05:02.270> up<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.510> four<00:05:02.720> times<00:05:02.990> when<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.740> turn

doing four days 11 hours so when I say

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.810 
doing four days 11 hours so when I say
at<00:05:15.050> its<00:05:15.199> default<00:05:15.350> that's<00:05:15.800> basically<00:05:16.160> when

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
at its default that's basically when

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.300 
at its default that's basically when
well<00:05:17.750> it's<00:05:17.960> not<00:05:18.110> it's<00:05:18.380> when<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.919> do<00:05:19.160> not

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
well it's not it's when you do not

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.969 
well it's not it's when you do not
select<00:05:19.699> other<00:05:20.120> applications<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.260> run<00:05:21.500> because

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
select other applications to run because

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.320 
select other applications to run because
what<00:05:22.130> happens<00:05:22.460> with<00:05:22.520> battery<00:05:22.850> stamina<00:05:23.030> mode

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
what happens with battery stamina mode

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.980 
what happens with battery stamina mode
is<00:05:23.570> when<00:05:24.139> you<00:05:24.320> turn<00:05:24.590> off<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.639> screen<00:05:26.150> so

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
is when you turn off the screen so

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.690 
is when you turn off the screen so
basically<00:05:27.289> I<00:05:27.620> think<00:05:27.650> they're<00:05:27.919> saying<00:05:28.130> most

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
basically I think they're saying most

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.850 
basically I think they're saying most
users<00:05:29.240> will<00:05:29.630> turn<00:05:29.810> off<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.110> screen<00:05:30.229> 90%<00:05:30.770> of

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
users will turn off the screen 90% of

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.550 
users will turn off the screen 90% of
the<00:05:30.950> time<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:32.120> will<00:05:32.630> deactivate<00:05:33.380> any

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
the time it will deactivate any

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.110 
the time it will deactivate any
erroneous<00:05:34.070> things<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.669> are<00:05:34.760> going<00:05:34.880> on<00:05:35.000> in

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
erroneous things that are going on in

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.190 
erroneous things that are going on in
the<00:05:35.180> background<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:35.599> that's<00:05:35.660> how<00:05:35.870> it's<00:05:36.020> able

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
the background and that's how it's able

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.230 
the background and that's how it's able
to<00:05:36.500> keep<00:05:36.680> that<00:05:36.770> standby<00:05:37.220> mode<00:05:37.430> there<00:05:38.060> are

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
to keep that standby mode there are

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.360 
to keep that standby mode there are
abilities<00:05:38.870> in<00:05:39.260> power<00:05:39.470> amount<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.039> battery

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
abilities in power amount and battery

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.469 
abilities in power amount and battery
stamina<00:05:40.729> mode<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.030> allows<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.330> to

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
stamina mode that allows you to

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.240 
stamina mode that allows you to
whitelist<00:05:41.840> certain<00:05:42.139> applications<00:05:42.650> so<00:05:43.070> once

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
whitelist certain applications so once

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.950 
whitelist certain applications so once
you<00:05:43.370> make<00:05:43.550> those<00:05:43.669> customizations<00:05:44.450> you<00:05:44.690> know

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
you make those customizations you know

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.990 
you make those customizations you know
them<00:05:45.169> but<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.620> standby<00:05:45.950> time<00:05:46.130> changes<00:05:46.580> but

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
them but the standby time changes but

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.409 
them but the standby time changes but
it's<00:05:47.150> still<00:05:47.419> a<00:05:47.720> pretty<00:05:48.320> pretty<00:05:49.190> meet<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:50.150> terms

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
it's still a pretty pretty meet in terms

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.260 
it's still a pretty pretty meet in terms
of<00:05:50.599> battery<00:05:50.780> management

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
of battery management

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.010 
of battery management
that's<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.930> pretty<00:05:53.110> thorough<00:05:53.349> uh<00:05:53.520> first<00:05:54.520> look
