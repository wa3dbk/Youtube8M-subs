00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.600 

today<00:00:00.930> we'll<00:00:01.050> be<00:00:01.140> doing<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.469> short<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.250> a

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
today we'll be doing a short video of a

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.400 
today we'll be doing a short video of a
reaction<00:00:02.879> that<00:00:03.200> everybody's<00:00:04.200> probably

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
reaction that everybody's probably

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.749 
reaction that everybody's probably
already<00:00:04.620> seen<00:00:04.920> before<00:00:05.310> but<00:00:05.520> it's<00:00:05.640> still

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
already seen before but it's still

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.820 
already seen before but it's still
exciting<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.359> do<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.440> that's<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> be

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
exciting to do and that's going to be

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.549 
exciting to do and that's going to be
putting<00:00:08.010> sodium<00:00:08.400> metal<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.700> water<00:00:09.080> so<00:00:10.080> first<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
putting sodium metal in water so first I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.600 
putting sodium metal in water so first I
wanted<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> show<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> sodium<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.550> I

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
wanted to show you the sodium that I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.470 
wanted to show you the sodium that I
have<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.750> large<00:00:13.049> mason<00:00:13.530> jar<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:14.450> that<00:00:15.450> I

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
have in this large mason jar here that I

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.090 
have in this large mason jar here that I
have<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> pound<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.170> sodium<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.710> I've<00:00:16.830> cut<00:00:17.070> up

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
have a pound of sodium that I've cut up

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.980 
have a pound of sodium that I've cut up
into<00:00:17.670> chunks<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> put<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.869> there<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.980> see

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
into chunks and put in there you can see

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.330 
into chunks and put in there you can see
that<00:00:21.990> occasionally<00:00:22.710> there's<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.250> bit

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that occasionally there's a little bit

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
that occasionally there's a little bit
of<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> sparkle<00:00:24.000> that's<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.199> crystal<00:00:25.680> regions

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
of a sparkle that's from crystal regions

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.380 
of a sparkle that's from crystal regions
that<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.369> appeared<00:00:26.640> especially<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.240> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
that have appeared especially on that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.580 
that have appeared especially on that
piece<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
piece there you can see all the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
piece there you can see all the
different<00:00:29.000> areas<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.330> higher<00:00:30.539> in

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
different areas that are higher in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
different areas that are higher in
reflectivity<00:00:32.099> than<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> rest<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.880> that's

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
reflectivity than the rest of it that's

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.049 
reflectivity than the rest of it that's
because<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.440> surface<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:35.340> sodium

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
because the surface of these sodium

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.090 
because the surface of these sodium
blocks<00:00:36.450> has<00:00:36.630> been<00:00:36.750> etched<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> water

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
blocks has been etched by the water

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
blocks has been etched by the water
that's<00:00:38.399> present<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.149> mineral<00:00:39.420> oil<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that's present in the mineral oil that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
that's present in the mineral oil that
they're<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.329> these

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
they're in right now so you get these

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
they're in right now so you get these
nice<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.620> beautiful<00:00:44.040> crystal<00:00:44.820> regions

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
nice really beautiful crystal regions

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.720 
nice really beautiful crystal regions
that<00:00:45.270> appear<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.010> due<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that appear and those are due to the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
that appear and those are due to the
cooling<00:00:48.719> process<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.800> basically<00:00:50.100> get

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
cooling process you basically get

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
cooling process you basically get
crystals<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> liquid<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> appear<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
crystals in the liquid that appear and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
crystals in the liquid that appear and
grow<00:00:52.379> until<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.890> meet<00:00:53.010> each<00:00:53.129> other<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
grow until they meet each other and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.470 
grow until they meet each other and
that's<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.480> causes<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.350> different

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
that's what causes these these different

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.950 
that's what causes these these different
sparkly<00:00:57.480> regions<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.699> my<00:00:59.879> pound<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
sparkly regions so that's my pound of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.710 
sparkly regions so that's my pound of
sodium<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.579> I've<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:03.629> pieces

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
sodium from that I've cut some pieces

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.050 
sodium from that I've cut some pieces
into<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.930> manageable<00:01:07.470> size<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> am<00:01:08.460> not

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
into more manageable size that I am not

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
into more manageable size that I am not
afraid<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.110> deal<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.920> least<00:01:10.950> less

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
afraid to deal with or at least less

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.480 
afraid to deal with or at least less
afraid<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.820> deal<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.260> there's<00:01:13.310> some<00:01:14.310> bubbles

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
afraid to deal with there's some bubbles

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.950 
afraid to deal with there's some bubbles
coming<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:15.810> these

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
coming off of these it's because these

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
coming off of these it's because these
are<00:01:16.080> freshly<00:01:16.350> cut<00:01:16.770> pieces<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:18.210> put<00:01:18.360> them

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
are freshly cut pieces I just put them

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.080 
are freshly cut pieces I just put them
in<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> mineral<00:01:18.930> oil<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:20.040> they're<00:01:20.700> reacting

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
in the mineral oil so they're reacting

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
in the mineral oil so they're reacting
with<00:01:21.570> some<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> residual<00:01:22.290> water<00:01:22.619> that's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with some of the residual water that's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980 
with some of the residual water that's
in<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> they're<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> bubble<00:01:24.750> for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
in there so they're going to bubble for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.210 
in there so they're going to bubble for
a<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.200> while<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:26.100> that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a little while but you can see that

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
a little while but you can see that
these<00:01:26.400> pieces<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.790> noticeably<00:01:27.240> shinier<00:01:27.869> than

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
these pieces are noticeably shinier than

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.960 
these pieces are noticeably shinier than
the<00:01:29.070> other<00:01:29.640> pieces<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.299> pound<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> sodium

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
the other pieces in my pound of sodium

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.890 
the other pieces in my pound of sodium
that's<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.240> again<00:01:33.720> those<00:01:33.869> are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that's because again those are

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.830 
that's because again those are
relatively<00:01:34.619> freshly<00:01:35.100> cut<00:01:35.310> surfaces<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.689> this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
relatively freshly cut surfaces so this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.440 
relatively freshly cut surfaces so this
is<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.140> using<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.790> reaction<00:01:39.180> coming

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is what I'm using in the reaction coming

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.859 
is what I'm using in the reaction coming
up<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> let's<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
up so let's get to it so first I want to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
up so let's get to it so first I want to
show<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.290> properties<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.770> sodium<00:01:47.250> one

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
show you some properties of sodium one

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
show you some properties of sodium one
of<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> how<00:01:48.659> easy<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.530> cut<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
of which is how easy it is to cut it's a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.289 
of which is how easy it is to cut it's a
really<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.729> soft<00:01:51.149> metal<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.670> very

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
really really soft metal so you can very

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
really really soft metal so you can very
easily<00:01:54.439> cut<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> piece<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
easily cut a piece out of it with a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.539 
easily cut a piece out of it with a
knife<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.600> gentle<00:01:57.899> pressure

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
knife so just with gentle pressure

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.480 
knife so just with gentle pressure
slides<00:01:59.549> right<00:01:59.790> through<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.340> can

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
slides right through it and now you can

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.770 
slides right through it and now you can
see<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.840> shiny<00:02:04.790> metallic<00:02:05.790> surface<00:02:06.509> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
see the really shiny metallic surface is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
see the really shiny metallic surface is
revealed<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.489> will<00:02:08.580> very<00:02:08.759> quickly

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
revealed but that will very quickly

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.559 
revealed but that will very quickly
tarnish<00:02:09.509> an<00:02:09.629> heir<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.920> more<00:02:11.160> gray

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
tarnish an heir to this more gray

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.780 
tarnish an heir to this more gray
hydroxide<00:02:12.569> coating

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
hydroxide coating

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.280 
hydroxide coating
okay<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.849> now<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.390> take<00:02:16.569> half<00:02:17.080> of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
okay so now I'm going to take half of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.839 
okay so now I'm going to take half of
that<00:02:17.349> little<00:02:17.709> tiny<00:02:17.860> piece<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.400> cut<00:02:18.640> off

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
that little tiny piece that I cut off

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.869 
that little tiny piece that I cut off
which<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:21.099> drop<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.489> some<00:02:21.640> water

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
which is this and drop it in some water

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.289 
which is this and drop it in some water
just<00:02:22.659> to<00:02:22.750> show<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.959> how<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.650> reacts<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.849> small

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
just to show you how it reacts on small

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.740 
just to show you how it reacts on small
scale<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.610> happens<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.180> sodium<00:02:28.510> metal

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
scale so what happens is sodium metal

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.940 
scale so what happens is sodium metal
reacts<00:02:29.019> with<00:02:29.110> water<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.530> form<00:02:29.739> sodium

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
reacts with water to form sodium

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.440 
reacts with water to form sodium
hydroxide<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.909> hydrogen<00:02:31.299> gas<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.299> can

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
hydroxide and hydrogen gas and you can

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.490 
hydroxide and hydrogen gas and you can
see<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.250> catches<00:02:42.400> fire<00:02:42.549> sometimes<00:02:43.500> so

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
see up and it catches fire sometimes so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.650 
see up and it catches fire sometimes so
that's<00:02:44.530> that's<00:02:44.950> from<00:02:45.310> what<00:02:46.090> happened<00:02:46.450> there

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
that's that's from what happened there

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.030 
that's that's from what happened there
was<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.920> sodium<00:02:49.500> still<00:02:50.500> going<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.769> little<00:02:50.950> bit

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
was the sodium still going a little bit

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.390 
was the sodium still going a little bit
what<00:02:51.370> happened<00:02:51.670> there<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.180> sodium<00:02:53.400> when

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
what happened there was the sodium when

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.800 
what happened there was the sodium when
it<00:02:54.489> reacts<00:02:54.730> with<00:02:54.790> water<00:02:55.030> makes<00:02:55.269> enough<00:02:55.540> heat

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
it reacts with water makes enough heat

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.520 
it reacts with water makes enough heat
to<00:02:56.190> melt<00:02:57.359> itself<00:02:58.359> so<00:02:58.810> reaches<00:02:59.140> its<00:02:59.260> melting

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
to melt itself so reaches its melting

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.830 
to melt itself so reaches its melting
point<00:02:59.560> very<00:02:59.980> quickly<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:01.299> saw<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
point very quickly and you saw that it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.170 
point very quickly and you saw that it
caused<00:03:02.079> it<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.530> ball<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.430> into<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> sphere

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
caused it to ball up into a sphere

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.970 
caused it to ball up into a sphere
because<00:03:04.329> that's<00:03:04.659> the<00:03:04.810> shape<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.739> minimizes

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
because that's the shape that minimizes

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.210 
because that's the shape that minimizes
service<00:03:06.730> area<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:08.379> it<00:03:08.500> did<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.069> then

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
service area so it did that and then

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.250 
service area so it did that and then
also<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.390> heat<00:03:10.629> is<00:03:10.810> enough<00:03:11.049> to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
also that that heat is enough to

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.259 
also that that heat is enough to
sometimes<00:03:11.799> ignite<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.700> hydrogen<00:03:12.849> that's

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
sometimes ignite the hydrogen that's

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.490 
sometimes ignite the hydrogen that's
produced<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:13.810> that's<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.079> caused<00:03:14.290> that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
produced and that's what caused that

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.530 
produced and that's what caused that
little<00:03:14.739> little<00:03:15.159> bit<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.400> pop<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.299> flame

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
little little bit of pop and the flame

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.449 
little little bit of pop and the flame
that<00:03:16.810> happened<00:03:17.139> there<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.130> also<00:03:18.250> may

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
that happened there and you also may

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.270 
that happened there and you also may
have<00:03:18.579> noticed<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.120> bright<00:03:19.630> yellow<00:03:19.870> color

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
have noticed the the bright yellow color

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.180 
have noticed the the bright yellow color
of<00:03:21.569> dust<00:03:22.569> of<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.079> sodium<00:03:23.470> flame<00:03:23.769> it's<00:03:24.010> very

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
of dust of a sodium flame it's very

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.659 
of dust of a sodium flame it's very
characteristic<00:03:24.849> of<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.030> sodium<00:03:25.299> flame<00:03:26.669> so

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
characteristic of a sodium flame so

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.039 
characteristic of a sodium flame so
let's<00:03:27.849> do<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.120> again<00:03:28.389> just<00:03:28.419> in<00:03:28.720> case<00:03:28.900> you

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
let's do that again just in case you

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:41.240 
let's do that again just in case you
missed<00:03:29.169> it<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.440> first<00:03:29.470> time

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.680 

okay<00:03:42.250> here's<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.580> larger<00:03:42.910> piece<00:03:43.120> about<00:03:43.390> half

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
okay here's the larger piece about half

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.660 
okay here's the larger piece about half
a<00:03:43.810> grams<00:03:44.080> worth<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.530> sodium<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:45.550> going

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
a grams worth of sodium and we're going

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.490 
a grams worth of sodium and we're going
to<00:03:45.730> toss<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.060> in<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.180> dishwater<00:03:46.960> there<00:03:47.260> and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
to toss it in that dishwater there and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:04:05.030 
to toss it in that dishwater there and
see<00:03:48.460> what<00:03:48.580> happens

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.199 

okay<00:04:06.040> another<00:04:06.250> piece<00:04:06.490> roughly<00:04:07.060> about<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
okay another piece roughly about the

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:24.809 
okay another piece roughly about the
same<00:04:07.330> size<00:04:07.660> let's<00:04:08.170> do<00:04:08.320> it<00:04:08.410> again

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:24.819 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.580 

so<00:04:25.819> this<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.060> actually<00:04:26.360> pretty<00:04:26.509> neat<00:04:26.780> as<00:04:27.530> a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
so this is actually pretty neat as a

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.439 
so this is actually pretty neat as a
result<00:04:27.979> of<00:04:28.069> this<00:04:28.160> reaction<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.789> produce<00:04:29.000> sodium

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
result of this reaction I produce sodium

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.870 
result of this reaction I produce sodium
hydroxide<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.370> that's<00:04:31.370> starting<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.639> react

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
hydroxide and that's starting to react

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.050 
hydroxide and that's starting to react
with<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> aluminum<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.110> container<00:04:33.500> here

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
with the aluminum of the container here

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.249 
with the aluminum of the container here
so<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.150> can<00:04:35.240> see<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.509> it's<00:04:35.630> bubbling<00:04:36.050> a

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
so you can see that it's bubbling a

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.130 
so you can see that it's bubbling a
little<00:04:37.009> bit
