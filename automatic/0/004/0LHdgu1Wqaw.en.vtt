worms<00:00:10.769> revolution<00:00:11.010> looks<00:00:11.490> different<00:00:11.849> yet

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
worms revolution looks different yet

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.060 
worms revolution looks different yet
familiar<00:00:12.450> can<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.349> tell<00:00:13.500> us<00:00:13.530> more<00:00:13.620> about<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
familiar can you tell us more about the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.490 
familiar can you tell us more about the
landscape<00:00:14.400> yeah<00:00:15.389> sure<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.809> mean<00:00:15.960> essentially

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
landscape yeah sure I mean essentially

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.220 
landscape yeah sure I mean essentially
we<00:00:16.740> wanted<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.100> keep<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.670> game<00:00:18.390> plan<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.779> 2d

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
we wanted to keep the game plan in 2d

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260 
we wanted to keep the game plan in 2d
like<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> previous<00:00:19.800> game<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.850> wanted<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
like the previous game what we wanted to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.240 
like the previous game what we wanted to
push<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> technology<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> was

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
push the technology so that it was

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.349 
push the technology so that it was
actually<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.029> 3d<00:00:24.480> vision<00:00:25.320> yeah<00:00:26.150> it's<00:00:27.150> not

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
actually all in 3d vision yeah it's not

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.330 
actually all in 3d vision yeah it's not
open<00:00:27.750> until<00:00:27.840> recently<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.590> other<00:00:28.769> computing

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
open until recently with other computing

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.650 
open until recently with other computing
power<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> ability<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.660> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
power to have the ability to do this so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930 
power to have the ability to do this so
in<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.230> iteration<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.550> 3d

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
in this iteration of the game we have 3d

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180 
in this iteration of the game we have 3d
landscapes<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> same<00:00:37.320> level<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.770> detail

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
landscapes at the same level of detail

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.280 
landscapes at the same level of detail
as<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.030> 2d<00:00:39.420> landscapes<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.140> had

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
as the 2d landscapes that we had

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.530 
as the 2d landscapes that we had
previous<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> particle

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
previous and how are the particle

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569 
previous and how are the particle
effects<00:00:42.809> different<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.379> game<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
effects different in this game in one is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.010 
effects different in this game in one is
a<00:00:44.610> revolution<00:00:45.149> we've<00:00:45.300> managed<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> put

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a revolution we've managed to put

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
a revolution we've managed to put
together<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.410> special<00:00:47.070> smoke<00:00:47.579> rendering

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
together a special smoke rendering

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.660 
together a special smoke rendering
system<00:00:48.300> which<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.230> allowed<00:00:49.590> us<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.309> huge

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
system which is allowed us to do a huge

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.600 
system which is allowed us to do a huge
amount<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.120> smoke<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> game<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.340> had

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
amount of smoke in the game we have had

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
amount of smoke in the game we have had
limitations<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> past<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:55.079> we've<00:00:55.410> not

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
limitations in the past where we've not

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.180 
limitations in the past where we've not
been<00:00:56.309> able<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.059> very<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:58.190> particle

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
been able to do very much particle

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.930 
been able to do very much particle
effects<00:00:59.930> explosion<00:01:00.980> in<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.340> game<00:01:02.640> we've

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
effects explosion in this game we've

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.570 
effects explosion in this game we've
managed<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.600> put<00:01:04.500> together<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.860> system<00:01:05.129> where

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
managed to put together a system where

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.560 
managed to put together a system where
we<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.420> huge<00:01:06.990> amount<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> particles

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
we can have a huge amount of particles

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
we can have a huge amount of particles
and<00:01:09.570> Governor<00:01:10.409> screaming<00:01:10.950> smoke

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and Governor screaming smoke

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.620 
and Governor screaming smoke
so<00:01:12.570> we've<00:01:12.870> not<00:01:13.020> limited<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:15.030> past<00:01:15.270> there's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so we've not limited in the past there's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.880 
so we've not limited in the past there's
been<00:01:15.660> objects<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.170> had<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> navigate<00:01:16.590> around

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
been objects I had to navigate around

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
been objects I had to navigate around
well<00:01:17.430> these<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.700> making<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:17.940> return<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.630> then

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
well these be making a return and then

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.880 
well these be making a return and then
worms<00:01:18.990> revolution<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
worms revolution we have a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
worms revolution we have a
fully-featured<00:01:20.460> physics<00:01:21.150> system<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
fully-featured physics system now in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.130 
fully-featured physics system now in
place<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:23.430> previous<00:01:23.880> games<00:01:24.090> we've<00:01:24.360> had<00:01:24.390> static

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
place in previous games we've had static

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
place in previous games we've had static
objects<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.100> top<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.550> lantern<00:01:26.760> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
objects on top of the lantern and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.200 
objects on top of the lantern and
they're<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.720> part<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.470> landscape

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
they're actually part of the landscape

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
they're actually part of the landscape
in<00:01:30.210> worms<00:01:30.450> revolution<00:01:30.630> these<00:01:31.230> now<00:01:31.440> move

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
in worms revolution these now move

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.220 
in worms revolution these now move
around<00:01:32.040> physics<00:01:32.910> physics<00:01:33.480> objects<00:01:34.050> can<00:01:34.200> be

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
around physics physics objects can be

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.960 
around physics physics objects can be
destroyed<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.160> have<00:01:35.280> extra<00:01:35.580> properties

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
example you could have a lighter which

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170 
example you could have a lighter which
explodes<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.710> our<00:01:40.800> test<00:01:41.160> tubes<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:41.700> expel

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
explodes the our test tubes which expel

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.810 
explodes the our test tubes which expel
poison<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.320> water<00:01:43.620> bottles<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.400> blow

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
poison and also water bottles can blow

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.719 
poison and also water bottles can blow
up<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.180> produce<00:01:45.810> water<00:01:46.340> what's<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.520> new

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
up and produce water what's this new

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
up and produce water what's this new
water<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.270> seeing<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:49.320> worms<00:01:49.530> revolution

water we're seeing in worms revolution
we<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.400> brand-new<00:01:50.790> water<00:01:51.290> custom<00:01:52.290> made

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
we have a brand-new water custom made

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
we have a brand-new water custom made
it's<00:01:53.250> very<00:01:53.430> realistic<00:01:54.140> we<00:01:55.140> include

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
it's very realistic we include

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's very realistic we include
properties<00:01:56.520> such<00:01:56.760> as<00:01:56.790> viscosity<00:01:57.979> compression

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
properties such as viscosity compression

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.490 
properties such as viscosity compression
and<00:01:59.100> also<00:01:59.369> turbulence<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.780> water<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.260> worms

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and also turbulence the water in worms

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.600 
and also turbulence the water in worms
revolution<00:02:01.910> can<00:02:02.910> push<00:02:03.150> objects<00:02:03.810> around<00:02:04.610> so

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
revolution can push objects around so

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.240 
revolution can push objects around so
