hopefully take him out after that point
so<00:01:30.270> i<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.020> flame<00:01:31.350> charge<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.159> should

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
so i got my flame charge and I should

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.830 
so i got my flame charge and I should
definitely<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.030> faster<00:01:33.390> than<00:01:33.420> him<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
definitely be faster than him because I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.260 
definitely be faster than him because I
think<00:01:34.140> he<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.380> naturally<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.579> same<00:01:35.850> base<00:01:36.060> B

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
think he is naturally the same base B

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.030 
think he is naturally the same base B
Disney<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.810> running<00:01:36.930> adamant<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.710> once<00:01:37.920> i

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
Disney but I'm running adamant so once i

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.620 
Disney but I'm running adamant so once i
get<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> flame<00:01:38.490> charge<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.939> i<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> outspeed

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
get the flame charge in i can outspeed

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
get the flame charge in i can outspeed
him<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> plan<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> worked<00:01:41.159> out

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
him so that's the plan and it worked out

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
him so that's the plan and it worked out
pretty<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:42.240> i'm<00:01:42.329> able<00:01:42.479> would<00:01:42.600> take

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
pretty good because i'm able would take

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.060 
pretty good because i'm able would take
him<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.990> wild<00:01:43.259> charge<00:01:43.409> i'm<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:44.009> sure

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
him out of the wild charge i'm not sure

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.260 
him out of the wild charge i'm not sure
if<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> crit<00:01:44.610> mattered<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:44.970> i<00:01:45.149> am

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
if the crit mattered because i am

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.460 
if the crit mattered because i am
adamant<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:48.060> lefties<00:01:48.630> from<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.170> i

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
adamant and that lefties from the i

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
adamant and that lefties from the i
think<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> lefties<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> first<00:01:50.670> two

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
think the lefties from the first two

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.069 
think the lefties from the first two
turns<00:01:51.030> come<00:01:51.210> back<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> save<00:01:51.659> me<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
turns come back to save me here as I

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.749 
turns come back to save me here as I
live<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.380> 20<00:01:52.710> which<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.189> nice<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.700> I

wanted to switch out too so I just want
for<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.040> stone<00:02:30.250> edge<00:02:30.400> cuz<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:30.820> stabbed<00:02:31.060> and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
for the stone edge cuz it's stabbed and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.820 
for the stone edge cuz it's stabbed and
whatnot<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.630> maybe<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:32.080> get<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.230> crit<00:02:32.530> but

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
whatnot and maybe I can get a crit but

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.820 
whatnot and maybe I can get a crit but
he's<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.940> go<00:02:34.090> for<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.330> rocks<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.110> I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
he's going to go for the rocks and I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.950 
he's going to go for the rocks and I
think<00:02:36.520> yeah<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> go<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.330> stone<00:02:37.570> edge<00:02:37.720> again

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
think yeah I go for the stone edge again

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.020 
think yeah I go for the stone edge again
I<00:02:38.110> honestly<00:02:39.040> cannot<00:02:39.520> remember<00:02:39.580> what<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.940> was

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
I honestly cannot remember what I was

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.130 
I honestly cannot remember what I was
predicting<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.510> switch<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.050> it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
predicting to switch to you but it

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.510 
predicting to switch to you but it
seemed<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.470> enough<00:02:41.710> damage<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.220> that's<00:02:42.400> a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
seemed to do enough damage so that's a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240 
seemed to do enough damage so that's a
to<00:02:43.240> hit<00:02:43.420> KO<00:02:43.630> after<00:02:44.110> rocks<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.620> 1x<00:02:44.920> i<00:02:45.040> think<00:02:45.190> i'm

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
to hit KO after rocks and 1x i think i'm

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.090 
to hit KO after rocks and 1x i think i'm
running<00:02:45.490> max<00:02:45.700> HP<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.360> attack<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.860> he<00:02:47.980> goes

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
running max HP and attack so he goes

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.590 
running max HP and attack so he goes
into<00:02:48.280> Venus<00:02:48.430> or<00:02:48.670> which<00:02:48.850> scares<00:02:49.120> me<00:02:49.300> out<00:02:49.420> with

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
into Venus or which scares me out with

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.900 
into Venus or which scares me out with
the<00:02:49.720> times<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.290> grass<00:02:50.530> move<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:51.040> think<00:02:51.760> I

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
have anything for this uh this dragonite

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.430 
have anything for this uh this dragonite
at<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.610> point<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.120> that's<00:04:25.780> even<00:04:26.200> that's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
at this point and that's even that's

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.600 
at this point and that's even that's
even<00:04:26.560> with<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.830> hustle<00:04:27.130> book<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.430> think

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
even with the hustle book so I think

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.660 
even with the hustle book so I think
stone<00:04:28.510> adjust<00:04:28.810> accuracies<00:04:29.230> like<00:04:29.410> 85<00:04:29.920> or<00:04:30.280> 80<00:04:30.460> or

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
stone adjust accuracies like 85 or 80 or

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.830 
stone adjust accuracies like 85 or 80 or
something<00:04:30.940> like<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.630> would<00:04:31.720> be

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
something like that so it would be

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.320 
something like that so it would be
eighty<00:04:32.080> percent<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:32.890> which<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.700> don't

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
eighty percent of that which is I don't

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330 
eighty percent of that which is I don't
know<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.510> wasn't<00:04:34.990> really<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.620> math<00:04:35.830> wizard<00:04:36.100> but

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
know I wasn't really a math wizard but

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.970 
know I wasn't really a math wizard but
it's<00:04:36.460> not<00:04:36.700> really<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:37.060> good<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.830> he's<00:04:38.830> gonna

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
it's not really that good so he's gonna

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.350 
it's not really that good so he's gonna
go<00:04:39.130> for<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.340> fake<00:04:39.520> out<00:04:39.670> take<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:40.030> my<00:04:40.150> dear

the vaio a light who I know will be able
to<00:04:52.750> take<00:04:52.900> hits<00:04:53.110> jest<00:04:53.380> as<00:04:53.560> well<00:04:54.630> I'm<00:04:55.630> not

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
to take hits jest as well I'm not

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.470 
to take hits jest as well I'm not
necessarily<00:04:56.530> better<00:04:56.770> but<00:04:57.100> I<00:04:57.490> know<00:04:57.850> white<00:04:58.090> slow

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
necessarily better but I know white slow

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.610 
necessarily better but I know white slow
down<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:58.810> much<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:59.050> thought<00:04:59.140> but<00:04:59.260> I<00:04:59.320> take<00:04:59.470> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
down so much I thought but I take the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.980 
down so much I thought but I take the
u-turn<00:04:59.860> really<00:05:00.250> well<00:05:00.400> as<00:05:00.580> well<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:00.990> he's

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
u-turn really well as well and he's

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.570 
u-turn really well as well and he's
going<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.170> go<00:05:02.320> ahead<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.500> switch<00:05:03.070> out<00:05:03.280> for

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
going to go ahead and switch out for

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.250 
going to go ahead and switch out for
some<00:05:03.730> reason<00:05:03.970> my<00:05:04.060> playback<00:05:04.450> lag<00:05:04.750> back<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.020> lot

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
some reason my playback lag back a lot

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.380 
some reason my playback lag back a lot
there<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:06.010> I<00:05:06.040> sped<00:05:06.490> up<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:06.730> next<00:05:07.030> part<00:05:07.240> as

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
there but I sped up this next part as

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.440 
there but I sped up this next part as
much<00:05:07.600> as<00:05:07.780> Sony<00:05:07.990> Vegas<00:05:08.200> would<00:05:08.560> allow<00:05:08.860> me<00:05:09.070> to

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
much as Sony Vegas would allow me to

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.720 
much as Sony Vegas would allow me to
because<00:05:10.450> this<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:11.050> this<00:05:11.620> is<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.860> portion<00:05:12.580> of

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
because this is a this is a portion of

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.070 
because this is a this is a portion of
the<00:05:12.850> match<00:05:13.000> where<00:05:13.270> Wartortle<00:05:13.780> proofs<00:05:13.960> is

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.580 
nasty but honestly uh I only would have
probably<00:05:49.570> alternated<00:05:50.140> between<00:05:50.169> protecting

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
probably alternated between protecting

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.409 
probably alternated between protecting
and<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:53.160> scalding<00:05:54.160> just<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.669> add<00:05:54.820> on<00:05:54.850> damage

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
and the scalding just to add on damage

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.570 
and the scalding just to add on damage
and<00:05:55.570> it's<00:05:55.690> a<00:05:55.750> deoxys<00:05:56.140> defense<00:05:56.560> so<00:05:56.919> i<00:05:57.130> don't

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
and it's a deoxys defense so i don't

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.010 
and it's a deoxys defense so i don't
know<00:05:57.669> what<00:05:57.790> he's<00:05:57.940> not<00:05:58.150> switching<00:05:58.450> out<00:05:58.690> i<00:05:58.720> guess

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
know what he's not switching out i guess

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.440 
know what he's not switching out i guess
he<00:05:59.169> really<00:05:59.380> doesn't<00:05:59.740> want<00:05:59.770> his<00:06:00.010> Ambo<00:06:00.340> pom<00:06:00.520> to

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
he really doesn't want his Ambo pom to

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.630 
he really doesn't want his Ambo pom to
take<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:01.930> thats<00:06:02.620> called<00:06:02.950> hit<00:06:03.190> so<00:06:03.340> he<00:06:03.460> just

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
take that thats called hit so he just

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.310 
take that thats called hit so he just
goes<00:06:03.820> for<00:06:03.850> their<00:06:04.090> proper<00:06:04.300> recover<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.200> uh

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
goes for their proper recover and uh

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.740 
goes for their proper recover and uh
let's<00:06:06.310> toxic<00:06:06.850> damage<00:06:07.090> stack<00:06:07.330> up<00:06:07.480> some<00:06:07.600> more

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
let's toxic damage stack up some more

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.780 
let's toxic damage stack up some more
which<00:06:07.870> seem<00:06:08.080> kind<00:06:08.290> of<00:06:08.350> silly<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.710> me<00:06:08.919> but

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
which seem kind of silly to me but

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.390 
which seem kind of silly to me but
knowing<00:06:10.720> he<00:06:11.440> knew<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:11.680> he<00:06:11.980> probably<00:06:12.190> would

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
knowing he knew that he probably would

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.130 
knowing he knew that he probably would
have<00:06:12.460> died<00:06:12.640> no<00:06:13.150> he<00:06:13.360> would<00:06:13.510> have<00:06:13.600> died<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:14.110> a

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
have died no he would have died to a

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.470 
have died no he would have died to a
scalding<00:06:15.010> rocks<00:06:15.040> which<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:15.730> and<00:06:15.850> then<00:06:15.940> deoxys

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
scalding rocks which and and then deoxys

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.330 
scalding rocks which and and then deoxys
would<00:06:16.630> have<00:06:16.720> just<00:06:16.870> been<00:06:17.020> toxic<00:06:17.200> stalled<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:17.860> if

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
would have just been toxic stalled so if

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.620 
would have just been toxic stalled so if
he<00:06:18.490> was<00:06:18.610> going<00:06:18.700> to<00:06:18.790> wear<00:06:18.940> me<00:06:19.060> down<00:06:19.090> he<00:06:19.419> had<00:06:19.510> to

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
he was going to wear me down he had to

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.970 
he was going to wear me down he had to
do<00:06:19.720> it<00:06:19.870> now<00:06:19.990> if<00:06:20.140> he<00:06:20.260> had<00:06:20.380> a<00:06:20.410> third<00:06:20.620> poke<00:06:20.860> he

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
do it now if he had a third poke he

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.230 
do it now if he had a third poke he
could<00:06:21.100> have<00:06:21.190> easily<00:06:21.370> gone<00:06:21.730> into<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.090> but

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
could have easily gone into that but

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.420 
could have easily gone into that but
thinking<00:06:22.480> about<00:06:22.690> it<00:06:22.840> was<00:06:22.930> kind<00:06:23.140> of<00:06:23.200> a<00:06:23.430> catch-22

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
thinking about it was kind of a catch-22

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.920 
thinking about it was kind of a catch-22
he<00:06:24.850> was<00:06:24.940> going<00:06:25.060> to<00:06:25.120> lose<00:06:25.270> something<00:06:25.630> one<00:06:25.780> way

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
he was going to lose something one way

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.210 
he was going to lose something one way
or<00:06:26.050> another<00:06:26.110> i'm<00:06:26.500> not<00:06:26.740> sure<00:06:26.800> if<00:06:26.890> i<00:06:27.010> use<00:06:27.190> that

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
or another i'm not sure if i use that

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.750 
or another i'm not sure if i use that
term<00:06:27.510> properly<00:06:28.510> but<00:06:28.720> yeah

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
term properly but yeah

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.840 
term properly but yeah
anyways<00:06:31.130> toxic<00:06:32.130> finally<00:06:32.460> kills<00:06:32.640> him<00:06:32.760> off

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
anyways toxic finally kills him off

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.760 
anyways toxic finally kills him off
which<00:06:33.060> is<00:06:33.090> nice<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.570> I<00:06:33.630> think<00:06:33.810> might<00:06:33.930> fade<00:06:34.470> one

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
which is nice and I think might fade one

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.320 
which is nice and I think might fade one
a<00:06:34.800> little<00:06:35.040> weird<00:06:35.190> though<00:06:35.340> but<00:06:35.520> he<00:06:35.550> bring<00:06:35.880> he

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
a little weird though but he bring he

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.640 
a little weird though but he bring he
brings<00:06:36.570> it<00:06:36.690> his<00:06:36.780> animal<00:06:37.020> paw<00:06:37.110> McGann<00:06:37.350> for<00:06:37.560> the

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
brings it his animal paw McGann for the

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.650 
brings it his animal paw McGann for the
last<00:06:37.860> time<00:06:38.040> and<00:06:38.340> uh<00:06:38.370> I'm<00:06:39.150> gonna<00:06:39.270> go<00:06:39.390> for<00:06:39.570> the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
last time and uh I'm gonna go for the

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.200 
last time and uh I'm gonna go for the
protect<00:06:40.080> just<00:06:40.290> to<00:06:40.350> get<00:06:40.470> a<00:06:40.500> little<00:06:40.680> bit<00:06:40.830> more

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
protect just to get a little bit more

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.540 
protect just to get a little bit more
awkward<00:06:42.210> which<00:06:42.690> is<00:06:42.780> going<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:42.960> be<00:06:43.020> nice<00:06:43.290> and<00:06:43.650> it

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
awkward which is going to be nice and it

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.920 
awkward which is going to be nice and it
means<00:06:44.730> you<00:06:44.820> can't<00:06:45.030> fake<00:06:45.210> out<00:06:45.390> either<00:06:45.600> which<00:06:45.900> is

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
means you can't fake out either which is

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.370 
means you can't fake out either which is
cool<00:06:46.230> so<00:06:46.440> i'm<00:06:47.160> at<00:06:47.340> about<00:06:47.370> 157<00:06:48.330> and<00:06:48.690> he<00:06:49.110> ends<00:06:49.350> up

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
cool so i'm at about 157 and he ends up

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.780 
cool so i'm at about 157 and he ends up
going<00:06:49.530> for<00:06:49.740> an<00:06:49.800> aerial<00:06:49.980> ace<00:06:50.220> because<00:06:50.400> i<00:06:50.460> guess

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
going for an aerial ace because i guess

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.640 
going for an aerial ace because i guess
that's<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:51.360> strongest<00:06:51.870> movie<00:06:52.260> has<00:06:52.410> because

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
that's the strongest movie has because

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.100 
that's the strongest movie has because
it's<00:06:52.830> boosted<00:06:53.220> by<00:06:53.340> technician<00:06:53.820> but<00:06:54.570> not<00:06:54.990> by

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
it's boosted by technician but not by

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.600 
it's boosted by technician but not by
step<00:06:55.350> so<00:06:55.530> it<00:06:55.590> doesn't<00:06:56.100> end<00:06:56.220> up<00:06:56.310> doing<00:06:56.490> that

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
step so it doesn't end up doing that

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.520 
step so it doesn't end up doing that
much<00:06:56.760> and<00:06:57.060> he<00:06:57.690> ends<00:06:57.870> up<00:06:57.900> killing<00:06:58.110> himself<00:06:58.290> out

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
much and he ends up killing himself out

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.840 
much and he ends up killing himself out
to<00:06:58.680> life<00:06:58.830> of<00:06:58.980> recalling<00:06:59.280> rocks<00:06:59.550> with<00:06:59.700> just

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
to life of recalling rocks with just

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.070 
to life of recalling rocks with just
funny<00:07:00.030> so<00:07:00.150> that's<00:07:00.450> the<00:07:00.540> end<00:07:00.630> of<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:00.780> game<00:07:00.810> guys
