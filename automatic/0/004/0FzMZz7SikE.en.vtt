Eclipse<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.150> probably<00:02:48.480> want<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.780> buy<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
Eclipse you probably want to buy a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.920 
Eclipse you probably want to buy a
couple<00:02:49.230> extra<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:51.060> they're<00:02:51.299> relatively

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
couple extra because they're relatively

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.440 
couple extra because they're relatively
inexpensive<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.950> odds<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:54.030> you're<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.329> to

later doghouse very similar except you
have<00:03:05.579> just<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:06.720> piece<00:03:07.079> will<00:03:07.380> go<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.790> both

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
have just this piece will go on both

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.390 
have just this piece will go on both
sides<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.570> then<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.530> linkage<00:03:11.040> would<00:03:11.730> attach

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
sides and then this linkage would attach

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.960 
sides and then this linkage would attach
on<00:03:14.400> both<00:03:14.670> sides<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:16.730> otherwise<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
on both sides like that otherwise the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.360 
on both sides like that otherwise the
thing<00:03:19.970> that's<00:03:20.970> done<00:03:21.329> now<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.739> can<00:03:22.890> hook<00:03:23.070> up<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
thing that's done now we can hook up the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.080 
thing that's done now we can hook up the
third<00:03:23.579> step
