00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
pretty damaged okay but the the memory

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.750 
pretty damaged okay but the the memory
card<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.930> chip<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.609> gone<00:00:21.050> it's<00:00:22.050> missing

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
card in it the chip is gone it's missing

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
card in it the chip is gone it's missing
so<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.210> black<00:00:24.480> box<00:00:24.750> didn't<00:00:25.199> work<00:00:25.350> it

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so the first black box didn't work it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
so the first black box didn't work it
was<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.920> damaged<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> didn't<00:00:26.699> work<00:00:27.050> they

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
was so damaged it didn't work they

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
according to investigators and the
second<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.320> uh<00:00:33.079> is<00:00:34.079> missing<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> memory<00:00:35.219> card

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
second one uh is missing the memory card

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.440 
second one uh is missing the memory card
it's<00:00:35.820> missing<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.989> chip<00:00:37.700> but<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's missing the the chip but we do have

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.049 
it's missing the the chip but we do have
information<00:00:40.190> based<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:42.530> other<00:00:47.059> information

that can be received from inside the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.630 
that can be received from inside the
plane<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:51.110> one<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> pilots<00:00:52.680> according

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
plane that one of the pilots according

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
plane that one of the pilots according
to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> voice<00:00:54.210> recordings<00:00:55.020> okay<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to the voice recordings okay so the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.069 
to the voice recordings okay so the
black<00:00:56.550> boxes<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.510> tell<00:00:57.690> us<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.960> the

black boxes which would tell us what the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
black boxes which would tell us what the
plane<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.590> doing<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> instruments

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
plane was doing and all the instruments

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
plane was doing and all the instruments
they're<00:01:00.809> both<00:01:01.050> damaged<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.859> can't<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.370> no

controlling the plane the plane

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.550 
controlling the plane the plane
descended<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.100> 18<00:01:35.729> minutes<00:01:36.439> before<00:01:37.439> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
descended for 18 minutes before it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
descended for 18 minutes before it
crashed<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:38.970> no<00:01:39.210> distress<00:01:39.780> calls<00:01:41.840> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
crashed there was no distress calls so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530 
crashed there was no distress calls so
and<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:44.310> pilot<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:44.970> locked<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.479> and

and one pilot was locked out and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.249 
and one pilot was locked out and
couldn't<00:01:46.079> get<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.369> serious<00:01:48.259> does

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
couldn't get in are you serious does

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
couldn't get in are you serious does
that<00:01:49.409> mean<00:01:49.590> he<00:01:49.860> killed<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> first<00:01:50.759> pilot<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that mean he killed the first pilot and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.219 
that mean he killed the first pilot and
left<00:01:51.750> him<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.970> doubt<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
left him in there I doubt it does that

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.590 
left him in there I doubt it does that
mean<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:57.270> first<00:01:57.570> pilot<00:01:58.020> locked<00:01:58.290> him<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
mean the first pilot locked him out and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
mean the first pilot locked him out and
then<00:02:00.600> went<00:02:00.960> ahead<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> did<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> suicide<00:02:02.250> crash

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
then went ahead and did a suicide crash

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.119 
then went ahead and did a suicide crash
to<00:02:02.939> destroy<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.479> plane<00:02:03.950> maybe<00:02:06.680> did<00:02:07.680> sunder

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
to destroy the plane maybe did sunder

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.589 
to destroy the plane maybe did sunder
and<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.429> anything<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
