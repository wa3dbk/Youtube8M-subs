00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.060
 so here I show you today 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:22.130
 how to change 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.250
 sannois kick in so so if sump 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.900
 Celtic 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 if when you press it does not start anymore 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.030
 scooter or so when you ride 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.519
 directly you hear a very loud noise 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.670
 strident so in fact what can have 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's your kicker nut that here is 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.149
 broken so in fact and if I press on 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.489
 the kick it turns effect driven so 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 it turns and drives your drive 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.100
 which necessarily turns the piston and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.710
 which starts your meuse couteure so 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 to remove it's very simple you have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.200
 turn right and you press 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200
 your kick 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.180
 this is what brings out your nut here 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.020
 from kik 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 so what is this here a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.979
 gear that is taken here and that makes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.909
 turn this here small teeth 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.860
 that fit into the same room more 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 or less that is on the drive 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 and so it's spinning so it can 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.759
 to be broken it redeems it costs 2 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.400
 between 2 and 5 euros 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.170
 and in fact it's very easy to remove 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.860
 So here we see that it makes sense to 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.920
 you'll just have to remove it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:59.360
 so this and so will you have this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.360
 as a piece once you receive it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.849
 you put it back like this so 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.319
 this anomie to new pieces by 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.850
 example and it will just be enough of the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:23.870
 put back in its basic location 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.870
 so here it is now discounted 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.450
 that's it and it works at that moment 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.560
 so we see that she's going back so that's 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.900
 very simple it does not cost much and that you 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.830
 avoid going to a mechanic who 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.830
 will make you pay quite a bit 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.010
 so as I told you before it's this 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.970
 who can prevent this problem there is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.840
 that you hear who is a really 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.519
 a shrill noise 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.010
 when you accelerate pushes to itself 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.769
 could ride with actually and arrested 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.380
 really to roll and in fact it's either 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.900
 here that broke and it's happening 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.340
 also a little break so he can 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.470
 this at that moment you stop yourself 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.470
 recommend the piece according to what it is 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.260
 to inform you well and it can be 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.420
 quickly change that you have taken 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.100
 really two minutes finally here is 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.769
 I hope it has more than a little 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.769
 tutor next time 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.690
 I
