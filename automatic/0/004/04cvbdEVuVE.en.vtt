00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.830
 Hello and welcome to the new video of an exciting path at about 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.849
 a game idea 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:13.790
 when I leave 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.790
 Olm approaches the front left 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.859
 each game device mainly agree on many different ones 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.449
 Amand like times are now not chemical elements but but 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.489
 well the two later react with each other 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.300
 One thing in advance, the game is really only suitable for people 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.460
 To be with her friend and not necessarily a deeper meaning or even 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 looking for a goal in a game 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.400
 and you can download the game 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.860
 come to WW point Peetz Bund and then / front left opposite 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.120
 but of course we also lay 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.410
 be in the bio-blocking 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.790
 and then you are on this page and clicking Download and Soost 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.920
 and state law underneath 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.820
 the game is in very small fits so also on any usb-stick to take away 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.410
 So perfect 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.200
 therefore mixture has ridden out of rehearsal and though i also have a wall here 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.190
 here and there a small country and then another here 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.130
 no water 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.370
 Although a producing element is talking 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.140
 and there the water 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 I've been pausing the game here will run again 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.590
 and who is not the talk 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 can you see what happens 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.270
 we have here 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.280
 various Sa army of all so alone given 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.310
 From the game itself all come to where else 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.440
 possibly thanks to many ages and takes 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.850
 we have sand 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.060
 and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.590
 dust 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.480
 that's not really convincing when i said this is an endgame 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.810
 and dust does exist 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 if it exists there could be 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.100
 and percent and now comes the exciting in the game is fired 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.619
 Prix ​​said some a little gimmick but it's all about building your own 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.829
 these raise Aldi's connection 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.280
 and they are here as the plant grows in the water 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.269
 exactly 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.269
 January water 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.309
 we can adjust the EAP in the US that ranges from 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.309
 especially from Moers a little radiant 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 we are running to a hundred and twenty-eight 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.839
 9 bath food is 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.689
 if you want to remove something then it is the easiest method easy 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.349
 Select MT here and then 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.099
 Poldi wanted to fill up the place where earlier this was so nice 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.170
 Now the Faces grown and then just flare them off 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.100
 If you want to get familiar, you can click on free and then 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.100
 Minute itself perfectly correct 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.669
 and here comes all murder 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.669
 listed 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.219
 then in Minden II in Vernum place 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.030
 and the reality 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.499
 38 explosives 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.889
 and if I fly free I have a bald one 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.889
 Fulda a Kleinert good at the scribbles 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.529
 OK 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.529
 Percent more 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.959
 Goro 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.359
 Bookeen 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.499
 now I want 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.949
 Ship fuller 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.579
 Rapolder 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.779
 the tried and tested mixture of Trier with Rad charcoal and sulfur 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 for anyone who has taken chemistry lessons 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.960
 per year 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.020
 that breaks 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.979
 him on the epd 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.229
 Accell completely upset 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.229
 yes I know a game 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.639
 until the next video and on the Lech 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.580
 Peters celebrate celebrated simply 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.989
 and see you next time
