00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.249 

okay<00:00:01.280> so<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.399> next<00:00:02.580> thing<00:00:02.879> that<00:00:03.090> we<00:00:03.449> do<00:00:03.600> now<00:00:03.810> is

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
okay so the next thing that we do now is

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay so the next thing that we do now is
the<00:00:04.580> commutativity<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:06.150> addition<00:00:06.870> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the commutativity of addition and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:20.439 
the commutativity of addition and
multiplication

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:33.619 

of<00:00:20.949> addition<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.340> multiplication

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.360 

now<00:00:34.199> what<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> mean<00:00:35.039> by<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:37.339> what<00:00:38.339> we

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
now what do you mean by this what we

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.090 
now what do you mean by this what we
mean<00:00:38.519> by<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.839> suppose<00:00:40.589> there<00:00:41.039> are

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
mean by this is that suppose there are

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.969 
mean by this is that suppose there are
two<00:00:41.370> board<00:00:41.820> members<00:00:42.440> let's<00:00:43.440> say<00:00:43.680> Oh<00:00:44.210> none<00:00:45.210> for

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:56.420 

app<00:00:49.979> sales<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:53.570> I<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.769> addition

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
app sales and I have to do an addition

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.779 
app sales and I have to do an addition
of<00:00:57.199> these<00:00:58.199> two<00:00:58.369> alone<00:00:59.369> now<00:01:00.619> four<00:01:01.619> plus<00:01:02.100> six<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
of these two alone now four plus six is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.070 
of these two alone now four plus six is
equal<00:01:03.089> to<00:01:03.449> knowledge<00:01:03.869> and<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.270> similarly<00:01:06.270> six

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
equal to knowledge and and similarly six

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.240 
equal to knowledge and and similarly six
plus<00:01:07.560> four<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.940> equal<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> ten

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
plus four is also equal to ten

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
plus four is also equal to ten
now<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.460> did<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.789> make<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> difference<00:01:12.390> whether

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
now it did not make a difference whether

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
now it did not make a difference whether
I<00:01:13.440> added<00:01:13.860> 4<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> 6<00:01:14.659> or<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.050> added<00:01:16.710> 6<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.490> 4<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.179> both

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
I added 4 to 6 or I added 6 to 4 in both

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.010 
I added 4 to 6 or I added 6 to 4 in both
the<00:01:18.630> cases<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.259> reserved<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.640> 10<00:01:21.119> which<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the cases I reserved was 10 which is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.120 
the cases I reserved was 10 which is
same<00:01:23.539> so<00:01:24.539> what<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.840> mean<00:01:25.049> by<00:01:25.130> commutative

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
same so what we mean by commutative

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.109 
same so what we mean by commutative
property<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.880> addition<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.679> when<00:01:29.580> we<00:01:29.850> add

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
property of addition is that when we add

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.949 
property of addition is that when we add
the<00:01:30.479> whole<00:01:30.750> numbers<00:01:31.520> whether<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.819> add<00:01:33.060> first

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
the whole numbers whether we add first

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.980 
the whole numbers whether we add first
say<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.850> 6<00:01:36.179> afterwards<00:01:36.750> which

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
say for first and 6 afterwards which

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
say for first and 6 afterwards which
means<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.440> first<00:01:37.649> number<00:01:37.979> first<00:01:38.219> and<00:01:38.399> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
means the first number first and the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.050 
means the first number first and the
second<00:01:38.789> ending<00:01:39.030> day<00:01:39.210> after<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:40.320> vice<00:01:40.770> versa

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
second ending day after or vice versa

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.929 
second ending day after or vice versa
which<00:01:42.060> means<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.810> add<00:01:42.990> 6<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> 4<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.340> both

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
which means that we add 6 to 4 in both

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.020 
which means that we add 6 to 4 in both
the<00:01:45.149> cases<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.780> result<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.710> unaffected<00:01:47.610> by

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the cases the result is unaffected by

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
the cases the result is unaffected by
the<00:01:48.090> fact<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:49.219> which<00:01:50.219> number<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.119> first<00:01:51.680> so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the fact that which number is first so

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
the fact that which number is first so
the<00:01:52.829> result<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.490> affected<00:01:53.700> by<00:01:54.240> whether<00:01:54.509> we

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the result is not affected by whether we

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.940 
the result is not affected by whether we
add<00:01:54.960> 4<00:01:55.320> first<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.799> 6<00:01:56.310> day<00:01:56.520> after<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:58.320> add<00:01:58.530> 6

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
add 4 first and 6 day after or we add 6

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.870 
add 4 first and 6 day after or we add 6
and<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> number<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and then up for to that number this is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.810 
and then up for to that number this is
called<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.479> commutativity<00:02:04.109> of<00:02:04.710> addition<00:02:07.820> now

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
called the commutativity of addition now

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.300 
called the commutativity of addition now
similarly<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:10.049> has<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.649> whether<00:02:11.070> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
similarly one has to see whether the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.830 
similarly one has to see whether the
whole<00:02:11.970> numbers<00:02:12.450> are<00:02:12.780> also<00:02:13.049> commutative<00:02:13.590> for

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
whole numbers are also commutative for

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.340 
whole numbers are also commutative for
multiplication<00:02:16.940> again<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.140> mean<00:02:19.290> by

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
multiplication again what do we mean by

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.670 
multiplication again what do we mean by
commutativity<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.370> multiplication<00:02:21.680> if

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
commutativity of multiplication if

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.600 
commutativity of multiplication if
suppose<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.760> multiply

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.949 

four<00:02:31.610> into<00:02:32.270> six<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.870> equal<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.440> 24<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:34.420> 6<00:02:35.420> into

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
four into six is equal to 24 and 6 into

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.880 
four into six is equal to 24 and 6 into
4<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.560> also<00:02:37.010> equal<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.670> variable<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:39.739> we

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
4 is also equal to variable so what we

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.030 
4 is also equal to variable so what we
say<00:02:40.099> is<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.959> true<00:02:42.319> which<00:02:43.010> means

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
say is that this is true which means

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.710 
say is that this is true which means
that<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.420> results<00:02:45.019> or<00:02:45.379> other<00:02:45.800> one<00:02:46.160> level

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that the results or other one level

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.750 
that the results or other one level
insofar<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:48.010> multiplication<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.160> concerned

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
insofar as multiplication is concerned

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.470 
insofar as multiplication is concerned
is<00:02:50.140> also<00:02:51.140> unaffected<00:02:52.010> about<00:02:52.400> which<00:02:52.760> number<00:02:53.060> is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
is also unaffected about which number is

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.320 
is also unaffected about which number is
used<00:02:53.690> first<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.160> may<00:02:55.310> multiply<00:02:55.459> six-month

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
used first so you may multiply six-month

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.839 
used first so you may multiply six-month
or<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:57.110> may<00:02:57.290> write<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.739> four<00:02:58.040> by<00:02:58.220> six<00:02:58.519> in

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
or you may write it like four by six in

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.640 
or you may write it like four by six in
both<00:02:59.569> cases<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.950> result<00:03:01.129> is<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.299> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
both cases the result is going to be the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.990 
both cases the result is going to be the
same<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:06.019> four<00:03:06.650> by<00:03:06.830> six<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.250> six<00:03:07.519> might<00:03:07.700> work

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
same so four by six and six might work

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.069 
same so four by six and six might work
both<00:03:08.299> are<00:03:08.510> equal<00:03:08.840> therefore<00:03:09.560> we<00:03:10.130> say<00:03:10.400> that

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
both are equal therefore we say that

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.160 
both are equal therefore we say that
multiplication<00:03:12.079> of<00:03:12.290> whole<00:03:12.980> number<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.670> also

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
multiplication of whole number is also

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.370 
multiplication of whole number is also
commutated

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
commutated

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.759 
commutated
which<00:03:16.160> means<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:17.209> we<00:03:17.540> may<00:03:17.690> multiply<00:03:17.900> two

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
which means that we may multiply two

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.250 
which means that we may multiply two
numbers<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.489> any<00:03:19.819> order<00:03:19.970> two<00:03:20.630> or<00:03:20.900> more<00:03:21.110> numbers

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
numbers in any order two or more numbers

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.490 
numbers in any order two or more numbers
in<00:03:21.680> any<00:03:21.890> order<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:23.360> result<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.989> going<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.349> be

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
in any order the result is going to be

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.160 
in any order the result is going to be
the<00:03:24.799> same<00:03:25.370> for<00:03:25.760> :

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.580 

now<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.530> like<00:03:30.739> we<00:03:30.950> did<00:03:31.579> earlier<00:03:31.760> is

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
now this like we did earlier is

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.770 
now this like we did earlier is
subtraction<00:03:33.590> also<00:03:34.780> commutative<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.850> again<00:03:38.180> if

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
subtraction also commutative so again if

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.979 
subtraction also commutative so again if
I<00:03:38.930> miles<00:03:39.230> subtract<00:03:39.980> 6<00:03:40.310> from<00:03:40.370> 4<00:03:40.880> comes<00:03:41.569> me<00:03:41.959> a

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
I miles subtract 6 from 4 comes me a

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.770 
I miles subtract 6 from 4 comes me a
number<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.530> minus<00:03:43.010> 2<00:03:43.220> whereas<00:03:44.060> if<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.359> do<00:03:44.600> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
number of minus 2 whereas if I do it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.809 
number of minus 2 whereas if I do it
otherwise<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.889> gives<00:03:46.130> me<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.340> number<00:03:46.549> of

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
otherwise it gives me a number of

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.620 
otherwise it gives me a number of
cluster<00:03:47.319> therefore<00:03:48.319> for<00:03:48.829> subtraction

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
cluster therefore for subtraction

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.110 
cluster therefore for subtraction
commutativity<00:03:50.630> does<00:03:51.470> not<00:03:51.709> allow<00:03:52.130> for<00:03:52.160> whole

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
commutativity does not allow for whole

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.390 
commutativity does not allow for whole
numbers

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
numbers

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.250 
numbers
similarly<00:03:55.400> division<00:03:56.269> also<00:03:56.450> as<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:57.230> have

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
similarly division also as we have

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.460 
similarly division also as we have
discussed<00:03:57.799> over<00:03:58.069> here<00:03:59.170> 4<00:04:00.170> by<00:04:00.440> 6<00:04:00.859> is<00:04:01.750> not<00:04:02.750> equal

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
discussed over here 4 by 6 is not equal

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.910 
discussed over here 4 by 6 is not equal
to<00:04:03.680> 6<00:04:04.220> 5<00:04:04.489> 4<00:04:04.900> always<00:04:05.900> X<00:04:06.079> is<00:04:06.230> what<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.769> is

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
to 6 5 4 always X is what this is

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.129 
to 6 5 4 always X is what this is
included<00:04:07.280> basically<00:04:07.549> 2<00:04:07.819> by<00:04:08.000> 3<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.540> this<00:04:09.079> is

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
included basically 2 by 3 and this is

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.370 
included basically 2 by 3 and this is
equal<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.590> 3<00:04:09.799> right<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.459> again<00:04:11.380> Parmentier

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
equal to 3 right so again Parmentier

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.490 
equal to 3 right so again Parmentier
Timothy<00:04:12.769> does<00:04:13.280> not<00:04:15.639> apply<00:04:16.639> for<00:04:17.289> division<00:04:18.289> as

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
Timothy does not apply for division as

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.950 
Timothy does not apply for division as
well<00:04:21.520> so<00:04:22.520> therefore<00:04:22.910> what<00:04:23.060> we<00:04:23.090> say<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.720> that

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
well so therefore what we say is that

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.440 
well so therefore what we say is that
for<00:04:24.770> two<00:04:24.950> numbers<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.639> division<00:04:26.060> with<00:04:26.240> 1

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
for two numbers the division with 1

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.589 
for two numbers the division with 1
necessarily<00:04:27.289> completed<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:29.150> subtraction

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
necessarily completed the subtraction

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.170 
necessarily completed the subtraction

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
need not necessarily be complicated but

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.020 
need not necessarily be complicated but
addition<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.169> multiplication<00:04:33.700> for<00:04:34.700> two
