00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.440
 for wins sadr and marty I hope 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.390
 that you are well we end up 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.960
 today for a new video 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.029
 money unlimited after patch 1.28 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.220
 so the method is really very 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.070
 single you must buy in advance 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.739
 a sentinel and xs I advise you 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.570
 to customize it just add one 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.040
 simple she breaks up as well as modify 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.200
 a few people what is the color that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.270
 will pass for less than 10000 dollars you 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.680
 have zapped the sentinel the beginning so 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.300
 it's a bit expensive at first but 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.640
 clearly it will be refunded enough 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.750
 easily so you have to walk around 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.460
 between 10pm and 4am in game 1 in 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.860
 the game and in real life of course 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.420
 then you go on the same path 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.000
 than me and go to the avenue 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.190
 winwood and at the same location as me 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.130
 you will meet a sentinel xs 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.990
 who will customize or not it depends 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.670
 really times his custom times 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.590
 no but clearly you will be able 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.369
 Romandes with 80 thousand dollars 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.439
 each 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.320
 so clearly this is not to neglect 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.479
 guys is against there's no 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.950
 bypass so I sorry but I think you 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.020
 not that it poses a lot of problems 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.280
 clearly you need a little bit of 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.979
 sousse where you will sell your 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.330
 vehicle 80 miles from their history 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.030
 you can redeem remake 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.110
 munitions weapons and so on and I 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.060
 think it can make the sphere 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.740
 little method that always works 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.920
 for those who sir since a lot of 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.260
 time 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 I had already posted this video but I 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.620
 their job again because I have them 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.360
 assaults value on xbox one and that 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.560
 still works so that's really 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.750
 very interesting 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.670
 I hope legal this video you liked 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.159
 for old gen players I do not know 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.320
 if it works for you to test me I 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.930
 am a little bit a little buggy my 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.070
 ps3 is complicated to test but I count 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.260
 on you guys in the comments 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.540
 to tell me more quote a dream has withdrawn 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.720
 earnings take care of yourself and hold everything 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.720
