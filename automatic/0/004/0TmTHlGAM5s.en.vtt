00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi this is Alex from PHP academy' and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360 
hi this is Alex from PHP academy' and
this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.689> another<00:00:03.929> tutorial<00:00:04.470> for<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.220> new

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
this is another tutorial for the new

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.579 
this is another tutorial for the new
Boston<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.600> example<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
Boston now in this example I'm going to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.530 
Boston now in this example I'm going to
be<00:00:07.680> showing<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.250> something<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.210> did<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
be showing you something we did in the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.410 
be showing you something we did in the
previous<00:00:09.960> tutorial<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.700> exploded<00:00:11.700> data<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.300> we

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
previous tutorial we exploded data so we

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.470 
previous tutorial we exploded data so we
took<00:00:12.630> data<00:00:12.900> from<00:00:13.130> this<00:00:14.130> file<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:15.030> here

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
took data from this file just here

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.260 
took data from this file just here
names.txt<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:17.039> was<00:00:17.130> comma<00:00:17.520> delimited<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.180> we

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
names.txt that was comma delimited so we

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.580 
names.txt that was comma delimited so we
had<00:00:18.390> commas<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> middle<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.260> each<00:00:19.350> piece

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
had commas in the middle of each piece

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.000 
had commas in the middle of each piece
of<00:00:19.619> data<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:21.210> read<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> took<00:00:22.859> away

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of data and we read it in and took away

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.750 
of data and we read it in and took away
the<00:00:23.250> commas<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.789> displayed<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> line<00:00:24.510> by<00:00:24.539> line

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
the commas and displayed it line by line

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.740 
the commas and displayed it line by line
rendering<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> basically<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.660> do

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
rendering it basically so we can do

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
rendering it basically so we can do
anything<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.230> each<00:00:28.349> name<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:29.340> suppose<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
anything with each name now suppose I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
anything with each name now suppose I
have<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.119> array<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.410> I've<00:00:31.740> got

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
have an array like this one and I've got

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.340 
have an array like this one and I've got
three<00:00:32.250> names<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.790> array<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.809> want<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
three names in my array and I want to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.170 
three names in my array and I want to
add<00:00:34.620> commas<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.610> between<00:00:36.829> this<00:00:37.829> data<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.030> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
add commas in between this data so as it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.229 
add commas in between this data so as it
stands<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.750> array<00:00:40.050> format<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.489> can

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
stands it's in array format we can

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.020 
stands it's in array format we can
access<00:00:42.739> each<00:00:43.739> element<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> array<00:00:44.730> by

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
access each element of the array by

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.290 
access each element of the array by
saying<00:00:45.410> names<00:00:46.410> array<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> putting<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
saying names array and putting in the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.080 
saying names array and putting in the
key<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> array<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.850> would

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
key of the array so here what would

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.049 
key of the array so here what would
happen<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.170> dripped<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.890> output<00:00:53.670> Alex

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
happen was we dripped with output Alex

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.080 
happen was we dripped with output Alex
now<00:00:55.039> I'm<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.430> completely<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
now I'm going to do completely what I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
now I'm going to do completely what I
did<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:58.199> completely<00:00:58.859> opposites<00:00:59.309> what<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> did

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
did with completely opposites what I did

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.979 
did with completely opposites what I did
with<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> explode<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> use

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
with the explode I'm going to use

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.500 
with the explode I'm going to use
implode<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> create<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.000> string

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
implode so I'm going to create a string

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
implode so I'm going to create a string
and<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.049> call<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.860> variable

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and I'm going to call this variable

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.539 
and I'm going to call this variable
string<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.320> implode<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
string and I'm going to say implode and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.440 
string and I'm going to say implode and
give<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> same<00:01:10.640> comma<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> did<00:01:12.299> before

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
give it the same comma that I did before

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.679 
give it the same comma that I did before
and<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:13.080> fact<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.500> space<00:01:14.180> then<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.509> going

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and in fact a space then what I'm going

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.499 
and in fact a space then what I'm going
to<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> give<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> value

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
to do is I'm going to give it the value

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.350 
to do is I'm going to give it the value
names<00:01:18.830> array<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.820> we've<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.150> done

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
names array now what we've actually done

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.590 
names array now what we've actually done
here<00:01:21.869> straight<00:01:22.380> away<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.950> we've<00:01:23.460> we've<00:01:23.970> taken

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
here straight away is we've we've taken

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.560 
here straight away is we've we've taken
away<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.950> array<00:01:26.280> we've<00:01:26.670> taken<00:01:27.000> away<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
away the array we've taken away the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
away the array we've taken away the
array<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.259> we've<00:01:29.070> created<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.880> string<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.810> now

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
array and we've created a string so now

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.899 
array and we've created a string so now
if<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.380> echo<00:01:31.979> out<00:01:32.189> string<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.110> see

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
if I just echo out string you can see

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
if I just echo out string you can see
that<00:01:37.130> we've<00:01:38.130> created<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:39.030> string<00:01:39.750> from<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.320> so

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that we've created a string from this so

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
that we've created a string from this so
if<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.640> reading<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> data<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
if I was reading in that data with the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.679 
if I was reading in that data with the
commas<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.100> wanted<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:44.759> say<00:01:45.479> maybe

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
commas and I wanted to then say maybe

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.889 
commas and I wanted to then say maybe
output<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.590> updated<00:01:47.189> data<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.880> need<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.750> way

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
output some updated data I need some way

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
output some updated data I need some way
of<00:01:48.930> taking<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.619> array<00:01:49.950> putting<00:01:50.549> commas<00:01:50.880> back

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
of taking that array putting commas back

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.740 
of taking that array putting commas back
into<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
into it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
into it
so<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.320> pop<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> back<00:01:52.649> into<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> file<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so I can pop it back into the file so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.530 
so I can pop it back into the file so
now<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.189> after<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.420> do<00:01:57.420> our

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
now what we can do is after this do our

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.050 
now what we can do is after this do our
usual<00:01:57.810> file<00:01:58.320> open<00:01:58.740> business<00:01:59.100> add<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.909> down

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
usual file open business add just down

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.679 
usual file open business add just down
here<00:02:00.350> open<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.590> file<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> file

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
here open up the file right to the file

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.459 
here open up the file right to the file
and<00:02:05.119> append<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> file<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.439> can

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and append to the file so we can we can

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
and append to the file so we can we can
you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:08.009> use<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> previous<00:02:08.729> tutorials<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you can use the previous tutorials to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.860 
you can use the previous tutorials to
achieve<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.580> simply<00:02:12.000> achieved<00:02:12.480> by

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
achieve this so it's simply achieved by

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.760 
achieve this so it's simply achieved by
the<00:02:12.930> implode

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the implode

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
the implode
and<00:02:13.920> obviously<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.550> not<00:02:14.670> limited<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.480> what

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and obviously you're not limited to what

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.500 
and obviously you're not limited to what
you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.530> put<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:18.180> implode

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
you can put in here you could implode

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.350 
you can put in here you could implode
using<00:02:19.110> let's<00:02:19.560> say<00:02:19.710> hyphens<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.150> come

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
using let's say hyphens so if we come

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.840 
using let's say hyphens so if we come
down<00:02:21.510> here<00:02:21.570> we'll<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.590> rid<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.700> we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
down here we'll get rid of this and we

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.750 
down here we'll get rid of this and we
could<00:02:23.970> echo<00:02:24.210> out<00:02:24.480> string<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.320> example<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:26.460> if

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
could echo out string for example now if

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640 
could echo out string for example now if
I<00:02:26.880> was<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> refresh<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.350> see<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
I was to refresh you can see that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.110 
I was to refresh you can see that
hyphens<00:02:29.100> have<00:02:29.220> been<00:02:29.400> put<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.730> between<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
hyphens have been put in between the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.480 
hyphens have been put in between the
data<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.350> isn't<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.680> used<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.250> file

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
data so this isn't just used for file

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.400 
data so this isn't just used for file
handling<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.270> be<00:02:33.360> used<00:02:33.570> for<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> variety

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
handling it can be used for a variety

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.260 
handling it can be used for a variety
different<00:02:34.520> uses<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.610> you're<00:02:35.760> trying<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> get

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
different uses if you're trying to get

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.120 
different uses if you're trying to get
an<00:02:36.390> array<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.350> want<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> create<00:02:37.920> some

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
an array and you want to create some

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.130 
an array and you want to create some
string<00:02:38.460> data<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.810> want<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
string data out of that and you want to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220 
string data out of that and you want to
use<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> little<00:02:40.860> delimiter<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.580> here<00:02:42.020> such<00:02:43.020> as<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
use a little delimiter in here such as a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.370 
use a little delimiter in here such as a
comma<00:02:43.560> or<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> forward<00:02:44.670> slash<00:02:44.850> maybe<00:02:45.270> even<00:02:46.050> tabs

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
comma or a forward slash maybe even tabs

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.740 
comma or a forward slash maybe even tabs
or<00:02:46.620> spaces<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.820> pop<00:02:48.030> them<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:48.510> and

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
or spaces you can pop them in there and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
or spaces you can pop them in there and
that<00:02:49.530> will<00:02:49.620> implode<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
that will implode that for you so if you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.760 
that will implode that for you so if you
think<00:02:51.180> about<00:02:51.300> exploding<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.110> imploding<00:02:52.590> it's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
think about exploding and imploding it's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.640 
think about exploding and imploding it's
the<00:02:52.890> complete<00:02:53.190> opposite
