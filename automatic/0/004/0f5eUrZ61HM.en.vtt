00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the weather is nice it's hot we start to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.430
 take a drink on the terrace 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.430
 and the moment to release the pistachios 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.079
 so today we will realize 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.579
 necklaces with pistachios so like 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.150
 usually we try to make 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.610
 recovers thoroughly and it makes something of 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.290
 rather not bad 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.589
 to achieve this creation you will have 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.600
 need empty shells of pistachios 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.229
 that you will have of course before 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.280
 use them 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.199
 thick canson paper glue 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 to make the bottom a little needle 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.640
 to drill holes and two small ones 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 rings do make the fasteners of the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.070
 painting and a palette and brushes 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 so just start with 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.400
 draw the shape that we want to give to the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.080
 necklace 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.220
 I make a plastron so it's 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.330
 big enough but you can too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330
 enclosed smaller 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.310
 once this reform is chosen you 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.590
 very simply cut it out and then you 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.300
 can start positioning your 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.240
 shells to see a little bit the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.310
 number of packages or you will need 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.870
 to put you which sizes etc. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.870
 so that's a little bit of an essay 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.740
 So here I am still missing 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.690
 badly more than my breastplate is big enough 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.560
 so what do I do next if I have them 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.330
 do one by one 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.690
 and then I put them in the order of 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.190
 colors so I make each ray a 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.640
 color since I'm going to do a little 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.640
 degraded 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.890
 so after I make you the stage of the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.090
 painting you know how to paint some 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.780
 copies I think it's not good 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.780
 complicated 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.770
 So here I am finished painting meco 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.660
 who, especially, I'm waiting for that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.180
 dry if possible I make a second 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.620
 layer because we will see anyway 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:53.780
 shell traits across I'm going 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.860
 start making the the fasteners for 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.630
 put the chain next 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.760
 so they all go a little less than piano 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.710
 like you do not have to make two 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.660
 holes it will be pretty simple since the one 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.160
 paper go anyway gently for 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.160
 not tear the sheet 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.709
 so these shares can not begin to 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.659
 stick the shells I confess that 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.010
 it's a little bit long mine was 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.950
 still big enough so that's true 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.510
 that it was quite laborious enough but 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.920
 in the end it gives something 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.239
 really nice so it's worth it 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.000
 spend an afternoon in front of a small 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.420
 movie to stick his girlfriends on your 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.150
 cardboard so I talked to you a little 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.109
 little bit of that I put you just a few 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.459
 pictures of the steps 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.890
 so we can see that at the beginning it's 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.540
 still take enough etc as and when 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.260
 measuring steps it becomes a little 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.269
 little cracra 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.609
 but do not worry 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.680
 especially if you use the gun 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.340
 to glue since that more cleaned very 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.980
 easily take off 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.689
 not even to load glue otherwise your 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.970
 package may fall to pieces 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.019
 but that's about giving that to the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.920
 end so you see that it's a little 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.920
 will cry but it does not matter 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.110
 that's what it gives once varnished 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.000
 so it's nice enough when you go 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.930
 nice to unify a little bit so 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.459
 what I 'm going to do now is 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 put the chain so I took a 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.540
 old chain and I just cut 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.360
 the bottom and I put a ring on one side 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.170
 and one ring of the other I'm going 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.040
 put on the small rings we could 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.040
 put on the carton 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.699
 and that's what it gives once mounted 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.520
 in necklace so I think it's nice enough 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.620
 especially with the degraded facts well 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.240
 often do what you want me the 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.650
 shape is pretty big since I like 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.330
 many big necklace echo them 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.650
 plastrons but you can do some 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.099
 much finer things you'll put 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.699
 pictures right after that I hope so 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.409
 you were pleased 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.539
 of course you can decline his 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.870
 necklaces in several forms 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.870
 colors 

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:20.239
 I make big kisses and I tell you to 

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:22.999
 the next phase a video for me 

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:25.819
 see create a wave holder with a book 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.919
 cycle and click left and to have 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.579
 a small role around my room and
