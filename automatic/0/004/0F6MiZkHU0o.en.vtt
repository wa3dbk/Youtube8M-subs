there's another place other place where
you<00:00:02.580> can<00:00:02.700> build<00:00:02.820> dams<00:00:03.740> is<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.370> saddles<00:00:06.029> of

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
you can build dams is in the saddles of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.549 
you can build dams is in the saddles of
landscapes<00:00:06.960> they<00:00:07.259> work<00:00:07.470> really<00:00:07.770> well<00:00:07.919> and

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
landscapes they work really well and

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.350 
landscapes they work really well and
here<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.710> go<00:00:10.740> here's<00:00:11.400> one<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> those<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.210> I've

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
here we go here's one of those that I've

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.369 
here we go here's one of those that I've
built<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> saddle<00:00:14.660> no<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> built<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.260> in

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
built on a saddle no I built this one in

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.060 
built on a saddle no I built this one in
96<00:00:17.480> this<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> heart<00:00:19.080> yeah<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.039> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
96 this is the heart yeah this is on a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.790 
96 this is the heart yeah this is on a
ridge<00:00:20.449> not<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.630> saddles<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.380> build<00:00:22.619> them

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
ridge not all saddles you can build them

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.490 
ridge not all saddles you can build them
but<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.640> built<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.689> about

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
but we built one that it's about about

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500 
but we built one that it's about about
6,000<00:00:26.160> bucks<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.550> something<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.029> storage

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
6,000 bucks or something that storage

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.209 
6,000 bucks or something that storage
about<00:00:28.140> five<00:00:28.769> acre<00:00:29.010> feet<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.650> paid<00:00:31.920> for

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
about five acre feet and we paid for

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.400 
about five acre feet and we paid for
that<00:00:32.399> by<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:34.079> year<00:00:34.730> seven<00:00:36.170> took<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> little

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that by about year seven took a little

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
that by about year seven took a little
while<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> wait<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.850> actually

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
while to wait for that well we actually

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
while to wait for that well we actually
paid<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.899> two<00:00:40.079> years<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.739> had<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
paid for it in two years we just had to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
paid for it in two years we just had to
wait<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.190> seven<00:00:41.700> years<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> cherry

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
wait for seven years for the cherry

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.340 
wait for seven years for the cherry
organic<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.350> pick<00:00:44.160> cherry<00:00:44.670> trees<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.300> grow

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
organic you pick cherry trees to grow

that are all irrigated by via gravity
from<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.700> system<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.140> dam<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.980> fed

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
from this system the dam is actually fed

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
from this system the dam is actually fed
by<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.820> Ridge<00:00:54.120> Ridge<00:00:54.629> lying<00:00:55.050> road<00:00:55.579> there's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
by that Ridge Ridge lying road there's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
by that Ridge Ridge lying road there's
no<00:00:56.760> channels<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:57.750> harvesting

no channels that are actually harvesting
the<00:00:58.710> water<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> road<00:00:59.520> runoff<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.120> runs

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the water it's the road runoff that runs

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680 
the water it's the road runoff that runs
down<00:01:00.960> into<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> saddle<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.239> how<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.300> first

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
down into the saddle and how we first

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
down into the saddle and how we first
knew<00:01:03.930> about<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.559> being<00:01:04.799> replaces<00:01:05.610> will

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
knew about that that being replaces will

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
knew about that that being replaces will
a<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.420> looking<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.020> key<00:01:07.290> line<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> studying

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a from looking at key line and studying

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
a from looking at key line and studying
our<00:01:08.430> landscape<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.330> also<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:10.049> looking<00:01:10.350> at

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
our landscape but also from looking at

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.480 
our landscape but also from looking at
the<00:01:10.619> erosion<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:13.490> problem

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the erosion that was right there problem

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.710 
the erosion that was right there problem
equals<00:01:14.850> solution<00:01:16.880> we<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.540> these

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
equals solution we put in all of these

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
equals solution we put in all of these
pipes<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> bottom<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> dam<00:01:20.340> some

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
pipes at the bottom of the dam some

pipes at the bottom of the dam some
here's<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.600> doing<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.259> Vietnam<00:01:22.909> that's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
here's me doing that in Vietnam that's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
here's me doing that in Vietnam that's
to<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.420> let<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> water<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to actually let go of the water out of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.960 
to actually let go of the water out of
the<00:01:26.610> bottom<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> damp<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.790> like<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.880> said

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the bottom of the damp and like I said

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.469 
the bottom of the damp and like I said
we<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:31.350> basically<00:01:32.130> turns<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.850> damn<00:01:33.090> into<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
we that basically turns the damn into a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.410 
we that basically turns the damn into a
large<00:01:33.780> system<00:01:34.250> where<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.579> empty<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> fully

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
large system where we can empty it fully

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
large system where we can empty it fully
we<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.439> much<00:01:37.590> water<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
we get as much water as we like out of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
we get as much water as we like out of
the<00:01:38.939> whole<00:01:39.090> thing<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.290> irrigate<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the whole thing then we can irrigate a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
the whole thing then we can irrigate a
lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> land<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.700> quickly<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.420> set<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
lot of land very quickly or set it up to

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.280 
lot of land very quickly or set it up to
irrigate<00:01:43.860> our<00:01:43.890> stock<00:01:44.340> troughs<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.290> drip

bit<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.399> hill<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.880> we're<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> we're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
bit of a hill here we're going to we're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.730 
bit of a hill here we're going to we're
going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.659> questions<00:02:07.140> near<00:02:07.409> we're

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
going to have questions near we're

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.590 
going to have questions near we're
nearly<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> end

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.730 

these<00:02:11.600> these<00:02:12.590> stops<00:02:13.100> here<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.780> stop<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.290> as

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
these these stops here you stop it as

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.290 
these these stops here you stop it as
the<00:02:15.950> water<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.280> running<00:02:16.460> along<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.030> just

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
the water is running along and it just

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.810 
the water is running along and it just
simply<00:02:17.540> floods<00:02:18.020> over<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> bank<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:19.670> it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
simply floods over the bank and here it

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.570 
simply floods over the bank and here it
goes<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.210> pasture<00:02:20.690> below<00:02:20.990> any<00:02:21.350> excess<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
goes the pasture below any excess is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.640 
goes the pasture below any excess is
caught<00:02:22.880> by<00:02:23.150> another<00:02:23.450> drain<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.050> then<00:02:24.140> take<00:02:24.200> it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
caught by another drain and then take it

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.700 
caught by another drain and then take it
back<00:02:24.680> into<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.340> next<00:02:25.610> damn<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.810> there's<00:02:27.050> what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
back into the next damn so there's what

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.260 
back into the next damn so there's what
doesn't<00:02:28.130> infiltrate<00:02:28.640> into<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.000> soil

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
doesn't infiltrate into the soil

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.840 
doesn't infiltrate into the soil
actually<00:02:29.810> gets<00:02:30.020> harvested<00:02:30.470> very<00:02:31.370> effective

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
actually gets harvested very effective

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.380 
actually gets harvested very effective
you<00:02:32.750> can<00:02:32.870> see<00:02:33.080> here<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.220> good<00:02:34.370> example<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:35.270> a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
you can see here and a good example of a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.810 
you can see here and a good example of a
system<00:02:35.780> not<00:02:36.050> unlike<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.440> we<00:02:36.950> saw<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.550> stand

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
system not unlike that we saw to stand

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.980 
system not unlike that we saw to stand
the<00:02:37.940> road<00:02:38.150> here<00:02:38.570> where<00:02:38.780> we've<00:02:39.680> got<00:02:40.840> what<00:02:41.840> we've

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
the road here where we've got what we've

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.020 
the road here where we've got what we've
got<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> valley<00:02:42.500> we've<00:02:42.950> put<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> pond<00:02:43.550> in<00:02:43.760> and

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
got a valley we've put a pond in and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.420 
got a valley we've put a pond in and
then<00:02:44.600> we<00:02:44.720> irrigate<00:02:45.050> about<00:02:45.530> 20<00:02:45.890> acres<00:02:46.280> of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
then we irrigate about 20 acres of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.760 
then we irrigate about 20 acres of
pasture<00:02:46.700> at<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.540> time<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.020> year<00:02:48.200> when<00:02:48.440> no<00:02:48.590> one

else has got anything as you can see
this<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.770> not<00:02:51.980> an<00:02:52.100> unusual<00:02:52.340> landscape

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
this is this is not an unusual landscape

different<00:03:38.390> types<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.840> ponds<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.710> we<00:03:40.310> put

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
different types of ponds and we put

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.490 
different types of ponds and we put
ponds<00:03:40.850> on<00:03:41.150> ridges<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.990> all<00:03:42.830> sorts<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.310> places

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.790 
ponds on ridges and all sorts of places
fit<00:03:45.500> them<00:03:45.680> in<00:03:45.800> with<00:03:46.010> our<00:03:46.190> with<00:03:46.520> our<00:03:46.550> landscapes

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
fit them in with our with our landscapes

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.540 
fit them in with our with our landscapes
very<00:03:48.800> nicely<00:03:49.090> now<00:03:50.620> we<00:03:51.620> sent<00:03:51.830> water<00:03:52.070> all<00:03:52.370> these

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
very nicely now we sent water all these

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.610 
very nicely now we sent water all these
different<00:03:52.820> ways<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.540> water<00:03:53.750> actually<00:03:54.020> runs

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
different ways the water actually runs

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.460 
different ways the water actually runs
pretty<00:03:55.430> slowly<00:03:55.850> that's<00:03:56.270> it's<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.810> fast<00:03:57.200> that

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
pretty slowly that's it's a fast that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.410 
pretty slowly that's it's a fast that
actually<00:03:57.860> goes<00:03:58.690> about<00:03:59.690> walking<00:03:59.990> pace<00:04:01.420> so

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
actually goes about walking pace so

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.910 
actually goes about walking pace so
we're<00:04:02.570> dropping<00:04:02.960> a<00:04:03.020> lot<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.350> sediment<00:04:03.800> out

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
we're dropping a lot of a sediment out

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.150 
we're dropping a lot of a sediment out
as<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.180> see<00:04:05.390> here<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:06.170> my<00:04:06.200> project<00:04:06.980> in

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
as you can see here and on my project in

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000 
as you can see here and on my project in
Vietnam<00:04:08.140> that's<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.350> sediment<00:04:09.920> that's

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
Vietnam that's the sediment that's

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.940 
Vietnam that's the sediment that's
dropped<00:04:10.460> out<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.720> first<00:04:12.140> year<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.770> that's

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
dropped out in the first year so that's

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.580 
dropped out in the first year so that's
that's<00:04:13.400> water<00:04:14.060> that's<00:04:14.540> soil<00:04:14.930> in<00:04:15.140> water<00:04:15.410> that

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
that's water that's soil in water that

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.430 
that's water that's soil in water that
hasn't<00:04:16.070> gone<00:04:16.250> off<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.549> site<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.810> then<00:04:18.260> we've

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
hasn't gone off the site and then we've

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.640 
hasn't gone off the site and then we've
cleaned<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.980> out<00:04:19.040> with<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.400> greater<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.650> in

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
cleaned that out with a greater and in

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.480 
cleaned that out with a greater and in
the<00:04:21.859> first<00:04:22.160> year<00:04:22.430> we<00:04:22.610> spent<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:23.600> week<00:04:24.490> cleaning

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
the first year we spent a week cleaning

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.880 
the first year we spent a week cleaning
out<00:04:25.760> all<00:04:25.790> of<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.180> drains<00:04:26.540> of<00:04:26.900> all<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.590> silt

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
out all of the drains of all of the silt

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.820 
out all of the drains of all of the silt
that<00:04:28.730> then<00:04:29.030> was<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.300> silk<00:04:29.930> was<00:04:30.110> then<00:04:30.320> used<00:04:30.560> in

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
that then was that silk was then used in

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.100 
that then was that silk was then used in
a<00:04:30.950> million<00:04:31.430> we've<00:04:31.700> got<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.880> tree<00:04:32.210> nursery<00:04:32.870> there

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
a million we've got a tree nursery there

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.320 
a million we've got a tree nursery there
that<00:04:33.350> grows<00:04:34.160> about<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.460> million<00:04:34.700> trees<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.300> year

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
that grows about a million trees a year

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.020 
that grows about a million trees a year
that<00:04:35.780> we<00:04:35.870> set<00:04:36.110> up<00:04:36.260> so<00:04:37.250> that's<00:04:37.430> all<00:04:37.610> use<00:04:37.790> for

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
that we set up so that's all use for

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.659 
that we set up so that's all use for
potting<00:04:38.360> mix<00:04:38.540> for<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.140> it's<00:04:39.290> not<00:04:39.440> wasted

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
potting mix for that so it's not wasted

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.050 
potting mix for that so it's not wasted
gets<00:04:40.669> distributed<00:04:41.120> again<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.580> just<00:04:43.880> I

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
gets distributed again and this I just I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.390 
gets distributed again and this I just I
just<00:04:44.120> sent<00:04:44.630> some<00:04:44.840> money<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.560> couple<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.190> weeks

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
just sent some money a couple of weeks

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.600 
just sent some money a couple of weeks
ago<00:04:46.580> for<00:04:47.000> this<00:04:47.120> project<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:48.020> we<00:04:48.710> did<00:04:48.919> three

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
ago for this project and we did three

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.290 
ago for this project and we did three
days<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:50.090> grading<00:04:50.570> this<00:04:50.750> time<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.850> system

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
days of grading this time so the system

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.650 
days of grading this time so the system
is<00:04:53.540> starting<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.430> not<00:04:55.430> erode<00:04:55.850> anywhere<00:04:56.450> near

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
is starting to not erode anywhere near

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.600 
is starting to not erode anywhere near
as<00:04:56.810> much<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:57.500> therefore<00:04:57.950> we're<00:04:58.100> not<00:04:58.220> having<00:04:58.460> to

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
as much so therefore we're not having to

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.580 
as much so therefore we're not having to
clean<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:59.000> drains<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.600> drain<00:04:59.870> cleaning<00:05:00.290> is

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
clean the drains the drain cleaning is

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.500 
clean the drains the drain cleaning is
really<00:05:00.890> my<00:05:01.040> indicator<00:05:01.520> of<00:05:01.669> how<00:05:01.880> much<00:05:02.090> silk

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
really my indicator of how much silk

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.280 
really my indicator of how much silk
we're<00:05:02.720> getting<00:05:03.020> lost<00:05:03.680> off<00:05:03.950> him
