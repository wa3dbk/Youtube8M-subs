 So let's start probably all the same wall and yes 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.920
 I really wanted to try these 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 such a palette here is 0 44 p 0 44 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.089
 or n 0 44 I do not know exactly in general here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 such are the wonderful shades of the girls themselves 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.910
 see yes something with pistachios you are he 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 here with a light shimmer 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.679
 all other shades are matte absolutely 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.300
 Well, I will make you my checks. 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:05.700
 all see means so the shadows start with 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 the fact that firstly they simply 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.270
 crazy pigments and girls they 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.090
 very very bright and very soft such 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.040
 straight shadows gorgeous are just gorgeous 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.580
 now I make my checks for you 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.520
 could consider them in more detail means 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.530
 I dreamed of course to try out the fall 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.440
 Makeup with such shadows look 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.300

 Satin was in it at first 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.670

 if you can see well well, in general, here 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.970
 something like this is written here 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.090
 on the bottom it means lipstick says 06 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.780
 967 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.970
 and just n17 so I don't know which 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.889
 of them can be considered a number but here 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.770
 such a pretty fudge camera 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:49.410
 quite accurately conveys her shades 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:53.620
 now i'll show you her swatch fudge 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:56.169
 so here so here it looks like this here 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.680
 pretty shade i would say he 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:01.990
 some kind of middle between the pink 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.900
 and some kind of red here but I do n't know 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.430
 in my opinion she is a little bit like that 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.270
 whether any such a strawberry that here at 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.150
 her shades 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.060
 quite pleasant but more in fold wreath 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.250
 here although the highway camera and so transmits like 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.290
 I do not know it seems to me in red 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.120
 More goes though in real life lipstick phrase 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.700
 so the girls wreath 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.390
 lipstick by the way now on my lips 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.680
 it feels pretty good on your lips 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.900
 lays down on a neatly thin layer 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.169
 really such a glossy soft 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.020

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.760
