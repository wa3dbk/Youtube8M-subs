00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.920
 yes hello to all and itno 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.389
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.969
 new comment harry and this time 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 it's a comment 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.510
 so this is a small challenge that the team 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.510
 imposed itself 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 you will see there that tiger is going 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.859
 directly on the position even if he 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 gets killed in fact it's going to be what the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.619
 purpose of this gameplay is to win the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.090
 domination as quickly as possible 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.890
 but especially as we did 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 usually do 1,200 0 that is 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.440
 almost impossible on this black ops 2nd 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.540
 unless you really fall on beats 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 since there are two sleeves that wants 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.559
 say that on both runs you have to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 not that they capture both positions 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.579
 at the time of the games it was not easy to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 succeed him on a hedge then what he 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.460
 had to do was make a preacher 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.300
 talla centex in order to kill them on their 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.489
 first position 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.090
 roy keane catching it unfortunately they 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 had the good idea trillions of 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.699
 disable grenades or explosives 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.770
 in the first seconds of play 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.290
 allowing the enemy to be 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.900
 100% on its capture position to Thursday 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.189
 unless they really decide the 6 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.970
 thp to capture it which is pretty much 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.659
 impossible so suddenly it makes this 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.680
 almost impossible or impossible challenge 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.119
 that's when we what we said to ourselves ben 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.740
 we will try to dominate the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.560
 more total possible so that is to say 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 maybe 1,200 to 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 10 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 at 20 to 30 to 40 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.110
 here and so each wc role so there 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.000
 you see the gameplay of the one who has 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.380
 makes one of the most beautiful parts 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.610
 knowing what are they going to 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.990
 difficult since I have it's from 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.030
 coordinate everyone 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.680
 to do a massacre at the same time you 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.720
 doubt well against not coordinating his 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.420
 team intends to do a massage anyway 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.280
 it was very complicated so here is 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.140
 in any case me I scream to do this pose and 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.200
 the teamplay give the instructions and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.080
 caetera and the guys are always at 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.149
 present to answer and that's it falls 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.470
 great when it listens when 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.179
 add teamplay and ben I can you 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.860
 to say that it is a real massacre 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.990
 so there you have seen that a long time 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.520
 for a long time we lose positions but 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.470
 but very quickly we arrive 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.680
 still go to win them back the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.030
 you saw that we are trying 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.560
 to go back to the position again 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 to whom they have just taken 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.160
 There you also saw that we have 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.710
 blackburn so there it is much more 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.210
 simple in the sense that everyone is going 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.510
 to be able to start out a little bit 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.459
 these series of killstreak so to know 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.459
 that has always bombing was 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.620
 many played with turrets or 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.070
 guards since this is the most practical 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.970
 for this type of gameplay challenge there you 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.430
 have seen that there is a turret that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.110
 protects its was in has divided the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.700
 roles as meaning you're your 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.470
 on his roofs to style on ben and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.660
 watteau you are sure at whatever happens 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 you manage this position by no means 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.680
 go on another way there etc 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.630
 after you have to adapt, there is one that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.489
 he dies ad I just die on 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.230
 it's ok me as a leader I say 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.170
 well you're shifting me here that you are case 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.200
 there you go there and it's super convenient 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.280
 then like this instruction these 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.209
 stories that not everyone is talking about 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.950
 because otherwise it becomes complicated 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.730
 in the sense of turning his shares to everything 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.050
 the world without a group 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.120
 so there in the east everywhere like that 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.620
 that's where the leader really has to 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.239
 do its job of giving 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.910
 instructions at his steps it's the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.350
 way instructions if they are not 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.799
 followed it is useless to play in 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.480
 team 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.950
 is like football is like 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.080
 sport there is a sensor the team 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.450
 he's supposed to lead the team and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.610
 the team is even stronger when 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.480
 the Swiss team and instructions as well 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.150
 found in the instructions 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.880
 well you usually have to follow it 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.430
 in the sense that or well at least 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.200
 of error will be the leader and not the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.760
 other maybe that leader had style 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.130
 this idea seems far-fetched but 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.630
 who in the end will finally pay a short 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.970
 leader make the decisions they 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.630
 take it here after that does not stop you 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.910
 not so really you see 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.290
 come re hours of instruction from him 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.400
 point out nicely but need not 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.290
 that everyone alumni parents 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.500
 Thursday you're confusing so there you have 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.450
 saw that push to his warthog to send 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.230
 tiger a helicopter tiger also has a 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.450
 warthog 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.530
 you also saw who had a little bug 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.940
 just now there is unfortunately 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.050
 it's the place mode it's the same 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.060
 possible to have you floating 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.630
 gameplay and a small sequence of 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.100
 a few seconds 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.960
 but here we can not know anything about it 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.910
 all latin white does not have a game 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.950
 capture hd 1 hd pvr and a cake or 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.900
 others that allow them to capture 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.550
 alive as long as he plays so suddenly 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.840
 must fish that in the studio mode and 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.430
 if your studio bugs well 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.650
 unfortunately we do not have the whole 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.030
 part and when the party is huge and 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.020
 who miss said on a game well it would be 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.940
 pity to deprive 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.230
 you saw that the first run goes 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.640
 come to an end in forty seconds 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.120
 you have seen that the old program dominates 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.430
 not bad 1 133 to 18 you saw that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.200
 tiger to his warthog that they keep well 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.970
 warm and he's right because 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.770
 we certainly need it in the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.250
 second run for 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.970
 for to protect the positions 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.430
 directly 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.840
 you also have it 1.25 that he 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.050
 in a row so life is like he 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.330
 had already unlocked a nuclear bomb 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.370
 without dying so it's really a very 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.520
 nice gameplay so is it going 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.139
 do the little snag in the nuclear that is 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.759
 a quiet I do not know at all I 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.710
 you will admit that I have no idea 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.840
 balloon here you know it's really 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.560
 damage he dies at five seconds from the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.150
 first run 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.740
 and you saw there they had to be 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.300
 good to mention these poor besides I 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.099
 Compassionate but a little hi you've got it 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.930
 already made your nuclear emblem 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.979
 by the way you won the title so I 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.919
 think it can go 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.120
 you saw that we win 157 to 18 so 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.690
 it's still a big fat 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.460
 live domination avola very very quickly 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.639
 point to the most opposite position 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.319
 I gave the role to my teammates 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.259
 seems to me that I had to go on c 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.690
 in the company of doggy and tiger if I 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.460
 I'm wrong here you go look tiger 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.050
 wok seem to go on directly 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.219
 these in which must be that there must be 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.270
 still go carefully because if 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.710
 you are going too fast and you will die 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.479
 to have started the opposite way so it serves 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.550
 a little bit of nothing there they wait in 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.110
 v his warthog and here it is hop on 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.370
 can the rats capture that's gem 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.389
 pink there was me there was tiger and 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.270
 then all the rest the team that comes 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.550
 here to help us 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.810
 the from there I know that we said 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.300
 right now we have more to lose 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.279
 position we have the three positions we have 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.800
 killstreaks one of series one is well 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:12.919
 positioned one must not do the cons 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.180
 So now we know the role of 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.460
 each to unlock a little bit is 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.569
 complicated to secure his positions that they 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.430
 had seen that there you see a little 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.860
 few people attic author of a two 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.539
 berries and is therefore well it was 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.800
 simply what was expected that 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:30.409
 everyone does in this gameplay the tiger 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.759
 was rather focused on those voices there that 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.219
 does not stop to climb a little bit 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.289
 to verb and the passage he could 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.759
 unlock his lightning strike so this is it 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.529
 which will allow as soon as we hear 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.259
 the enemy captured a sheath 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:44.630
 mensura right for example so that allows 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:48.199
 to really be able to prevent the enemy from 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.580
 capture now here we beat the 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.039
 part of his touch to an end since 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.830
 our opposition to 193 196 it's going very 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:57.770
 very very very very fast and the game is going 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.029
 soon to end 199 and watch out
