00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
I may go ahead and crack it open and get

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.280 
I may go ahead and crack it open and get
a<00:02:40.430> parts<00:02:40.730> count<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.720> kind<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:41.989> show<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.230> what

a parts count just kind of show you what
I<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.800> there<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:49.280> 3:48<00:02:50.120> why<00:02:51.110> should<00:02:51.290> you

a<00:02:54.709> mock<00:02:54.950> I'm<00:02:55.130> working<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.760> wasn't<00:02:59.450> grab

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
a mock I'm working on but I wasn't grab

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.160 
a mock I'm working on but I wasn't grab
that<00:03:00.850> was<00:03:01.850> their<00:03:04.450> main<00:03:05.450> thing<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.810> really

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
that was their main thing I really

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.850 
that was their main thing I really
wanted<00:03:06.530> was<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:08.200> little<00:03:09.200> printed<00:03:09.590> legal

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
wanted was this little printed legal

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.280 
wanted was this little printed legal
tile<00:03:10.040> that's<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.390> far<00:03:11.570> mock<00:03:11.840> I'm<00:03:11.989> working

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
tile that's all so far mock I'm working

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.840 
tile that's all so far mock I'm working
on<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.739> actually<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.070> same<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.489> this

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
on it's actually the same one that this

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.539 
on it's actually the same one that this
is<00:03:13.910> for<00:03:14.560> but<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.620> figured<00:03:15.680> these<00:03:16.040> letters<00:03:16.459> would

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
is for but I figured these letters would

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.190 
is for but I figured these letters would
be<00:03:16.640> cool<00:03:16.850> possibly<00:03:17.390> for<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.570> gas<00:03:17.720> station<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
be cool possibly for the gas station and

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.160 
be cool possibly for the gas station and
stuff<00:03:21.200> like<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:22.340> was<00:03:22.489> only<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.850> think<00:03:23.170> 15

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
stuff like that it was only I think 15

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.350 
stuff like that it was only I think 15
bucks<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.330> good<00:03:27.230> deal<00:03:27.440> for<00:03:27.650> me<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.799> guess<00:03:28.360> it's

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
bucks so a good deal for me I guess it's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.710 
bucks so a good deal for me I guess it's
kind<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.630> what's<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:29.959> there<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:32.330> I'm<00:03:32.510> gonna<00:03:32.630> use

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
kind of what's in there if I'm gonna use

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.440 
kind of what's in there if I'm gonna use
the<00:03:32.989> letters<00:03:33.260> for<00:03:34.030> I'll<00:03:35.030> probably<00:03:35.209> have<00:03:35.420> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
the letters for I'll probably have to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.420 
the letters for I'll probably have to
punch<00:03:35.780> up<00:03:35.900> many<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.230> letters<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.769> missed

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
punch up many of the letters I missed

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.280 
punch up many of the letters I missed
about<00:03:37.670> Lego<00:03:38.209> for<00:03:38.450> Chris<00:03:38.630> somewhere<00:03:39.049> or

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
something but mainly want the numbers so

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.240 
something but mainly want the numbers so
I<00:03:41.420> could<00:03:41.600> put<00:03:41.890> prices<00:03:42.890> on<00:03:43.160> my<00:03:44.620> VP<00:03:45.620> sign<00:03:45.920> for<00:03:46.190> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
I could put prices on my VP sign for the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.360 
I could put prices on my VP sign for the
gas<00:03:46.400> stations<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.650> there's<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:49.010> it's<00:03:49.190> not<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
gas stations so there's that it's not a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.979 
gas stations so there's that it's not a
very<00:03:49.579> big<00:03:49.670> haul<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.860> far<00:03:52.420> trying<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.570> block<00:03:53.720> on

dollar
brick<00:04:04.519> stackers<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.660> reason<00:04:05.900> he's<00:04:06.049> only

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
brick stackers and the reason he's only

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.140 
brick stackers and the reason he's only
ahead<00:04:06.590> it's<00:04:07.250> because<00:04:07.579> that's<00:04:07.760> all<00:04:08.000> I've

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
ahead it's because that's all I've

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.910 
ahead it's because that's all I've
really<00:04:08.180> seen<00:04:08.630> of

really seen of
stackers<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:11.300> that's<00:04:11.959> why<00:04:12.140> his<00:04:12.319> heads<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.620> kind

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
stackers so that's why his heads is kind

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.229 
stackers so that's why his heads is kind

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
probably doing a little video to like

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.810 
probably doing a little video to like
the<00:04:26.840> close-up<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.440> explain<00:04:27.770> why<00:04:28.760> these

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
the close-up and explain why these

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.340 
the close-up and explain why these
characters<00:04:29.480> are<00:04:29.630> built<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:32.169> just<00:04:33.169> like

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
characters are built and just like

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.190 
characters are built and just like
something<00:04:33.680> like<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.660> but<00:04:35.660> those<00:04:35.930> two<00:04:36.169> are

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
something like that but those two are

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.580 
something like that but those two are
for<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.740> mock<00:04:36.980> I'm<00:04:37.160> working<00:04:37.430> on<00:04:38.050> God<00:04:39.050> one<00:04:39.500> of
