00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello everyone is welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.310
 a new video is bibi300 then 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.839
 before the arrival of the big collectors of the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.080
 march and well we'll come back a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.840
 little bit backwards with that of 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.030
 castlevania lords of shadow the collector 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
 so from this game released already since a good 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.670
 moment then you will tell me but 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.859
 why him 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 you have to know that this collector is a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.160
 little bit particular a pass 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
 necessarily by six compared what to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.580
 inside what are you going to see he 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.769
 there is not necessarily much of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.779
 collector but mostly because in fact 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 the guys who had to distribute these 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.989
 fucking collector's edition at the time 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 of his exit 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.680
 well, they're Shiites, that's all 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.960
 just know that the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.149
 collectors that was normally expected 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.399
 for us in France are never 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.870
 arrived home I think they are 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.370
 gone to another country outside the game was 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.020
 saw it was in belgium if it was in 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.879
 Swiss if it was elsewhere I know more 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.219
 exactly but basically all of our 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 examples of all our copies for 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 planned for France are never 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 arrived so suddenly it's a collector 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.980
 who took a lot of value because 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 that for him to find that was becoming 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 extremely complicated here and I had 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 the chance to find one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.439
 and I can tell you that frankly I 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.510
 I'm glad to have it so for 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.670
 look to see a little bit where it's 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 find then try to grab that on 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.090
 amazon so i got me i got the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.680
 chance to have it at 30 euros pretty much 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 now the problem is that the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 prices are already starting once again from 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.290
 more to fly so we air we found 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.229
 the names of the stuff at 50 60 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.520
 there are guys going to 110 120 130 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.799
 euros it's a sick thing I 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.680
 understand absolutely not embarrassed but these 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.689
 principles of the du of the exemplary who 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 never happened and was edited 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.200
 in very few copies chinaud so 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.590
 so that's what we're dealing with 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.210
 so the famous castlevania here so in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.100
 collector's edition so a little box 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 enough to this friendly 1 in the end 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 with mostly an art an art works 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 really beautiful I think that's it 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.189
 that we should have actually been on the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.649
 basic box 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.469
 so when we remove and well it's very 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.820
 simple that's what it gives or has 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.890
 it must obviously make you think 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.570
 something that mask since it is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.399
 one of the representations that we have 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.500
 in the game and in fact it opens up in 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.729
 done like a book here it saves in 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.869
 done like a book simply and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.629
 we have it all inside 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.629
 so we're going a little bit of it 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.120
 so that's a nice little illustration 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.330
 still, despite everything to leave that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.819
 so that's it then so against the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.299
 box that's it it was this 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.659
 kind of old musty books so at 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.790
 final so we have the right to the record 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.620
 so the game with the cd yielded 2 because 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.010
 that he was on two CDs on the version 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.239
 xbox and we obviously have the soul trac and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.500
 that's good it's really very 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.000
 well because in further afield it was 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.280
 game was really beautiful 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 we can still admire once 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.629
 more and drawings illustrations 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.769
 are really beautiful 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.390
 I think it's really 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.769
 good mouth on the other hand that's it is there is 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.629
 no box it's just a kind of 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.970
 fucking books that stinks a little bit 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.190
 had with the batman arkham asylum by 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.079
 example and then I'm more of others 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.670
 games or ultimately it takes no box to 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.129
 inside it's really ugly I 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.109
 found by cons he would still 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.200
 could have made an effort on it 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.629
 and obviously what interests people 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.370
 so this case in there you go me 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.109
 to say but what is it 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 what do not they say what is it 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.530
 is happening 1 and well you will see 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.010
 it's very simple obviously to speak of 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.599
 masks and there you have you a body 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.470
 broken good I think there was no 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:33.010
 need to say more inside wants this 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.549
 collector we extend the mask game same 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.599
 transformed into zoo masks and so here 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.750
 the replica of the present mask 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.849
 in the game so there is not both 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.250
 since obviously when we talk about the game 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.139
 we say that there are two masks but 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.609
 so it's still good 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.859
 quality because if we hear if we 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.989
 listening 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.120
 this is not plastic is not 2 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.530
 it's not an old thing all rotten 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.230
 moldy we still feel that has a 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.680
 some already it's really heavy 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.849
 it's clear 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.620
 and then I find that at the level of 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.970
 representation of the mask that gets away 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.319
 rather well then by cons you see 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.510
 so it's not to be hidden we put on his 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.340
 face as much be clear because the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.799
 mask is a little small no if we 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.660
 look at the box so see 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.160
 it's small enough it's not a trick 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.889
 that you will put on your face to sochaux 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.189
 6th 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.919
 your head is 5 cm 3 of which there 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.629
 also a small base that allows 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.699
 so to put there and that allows the 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.900
 to hold on so that's it for the one who 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.379
 would like to make it fit all 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.819
 simply 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:37.249
 I may even have the master like that 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:40.960
 hop we'll be able to hold it then 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:44.210
 I guess it must be like that 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.599
 like that yeah that's it 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.870
 it's something like that nickel the little one 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:54.319
 mask and that's it and you'll tell me 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.180
 but it's all right yes it's all here 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.229
 so obviously vla you is 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.080
 certainly telling you my 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.900
 fucking as many euros as the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.669
 guys the wind for so little ah yes and that's 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.300
 that the principle of the collector is that the 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.219
 principle of publishing that comes in very 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.169
 very small amount at home and who 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.490
 finally never come here it's 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.719
 a little bit the problem so necessarily 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.289
 even though there is almost nothing 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.139
 interior 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.669
 Well, the prices go off completely 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.219
 that like it's like right now what 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.110
 was going on neither no kuni will collect us 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.490
 we in French version are missing from 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.870
 stuff compared to the us version and 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.629
 yet today it's a collector 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.979
 who goes 200 balls 200 tickets like 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.439
 has appreciated in the name it is 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.479
 impressive then I'm afraid 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.279
 for bioshock for god of war and it's up to 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.719
 my opinion is the same, it's likely to be 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.669
 the same anyway so here's after 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.259
 let's be honest I'm a fan of 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.719
 castlevania games box fans of the series 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.509
 the license this collector there they deserve 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:50.110
 not but more than 30 euros no more than 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:53.330
 thirty roads because in canvas to 50 minimum 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.000
 minimum but he deserves no lower he 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.649
 nothing more needs to be clear y'a 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.180
 nothing more what compared to what we 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.620
 may have 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.520
 comparatively and especially compared 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.289
 the value for money content wood and 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.080
 that that I'm logical with his dance that 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.210
 must put that in the skull 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.090
 certainly we have to play it plays on the rarity 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.569
 the more rare a product is, the more it takes 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.360
 value 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.189
 even if it is extremely pure iep there 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.009
 again it's not a 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:23.689
 generality on this point but here is a 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.750
 little bit in what it gives to 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:28.460
 advise or inneov the fad May 6 but 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.699
 look for you do not have 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.219
 in you taking his 110 euros soaps 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.169
 not worth it for others you can 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.360
 go briskly your way 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.439
 there is nothing more to see of any 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.419
 way in this edition 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.849
 here and I'll see you soon 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.780
 wear or else epub video games hi 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.780
 everyone and see you next time
