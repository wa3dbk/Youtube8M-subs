00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:06.010 
and what I might do might kind of two
bolts<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.490> gas<00:02:58.700> doesn't<00:02:59.090> move<00:02:59.240> around<00:03:05.020> and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
bolts so the gas doesn't move around and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.610 
bolts so the gas doesn't move around and
again<00:03:06.790> make<00:03:07.790> sure<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.090> use<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.600> blue<00:03:09.190> loctite

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
again make sure you use the blue loctite

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.770 
again make sure you use the blue loctite
the<00:03:12.620> blue<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.220> still<00:03:13.660> loosen<00:03:14.660> up

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the blue one you can still loosen up

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.920 
the blue one you can still loosen up
with<00:03:15.290> tools<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:16.250> can<00:03:16.760> use<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.090> red<00:03:17.330> lock<00:03:17.600> time

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
with tools you can use the red lock time

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.180 
with tools you can use the red lock time
you<00:03:18.080> have<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.410> heat<00:03:19.000> both<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.300> with<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.570> torch

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
you have to heat both up with the torch

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.210 
you have to heat both up with the torch
and<00:03:22.190> then<00:03:22.489> loosen<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:25.180> not<00:03:26.180> be<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.320> tight

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
and then loosen it and not be so tight

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.520 
and then loosen it and not be so tight
for<00:03:28.400> sure<00:03:28.640> just<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> exhaust<00:03:30.050> ones<00:03:30.380> you

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
for sure just on the exhaust ones you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.400 
for sure just on the exhaust ones you
need<00:03:30.650> really<00:03:31.720> some<00:03:32.720> people<00:03:32.750> say<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.140> put

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
need really some people say to put

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.850 
need really some people say to put
gaskets<00:03:34.040> maker<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.910> each<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.420> but<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:36.590> didn't

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
gaskets maker on each one but it didn't

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.729 
gaskets maker on each one but it didn't
come<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.340> from<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.760> factory<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.739> almost

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
come with it from the factory so almost

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.420 
come with it from the factory so almost
you<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> good<00:03:40.160> torch<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.890> find<00:03:43.160> and

if there is a leak right if you do is

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.240 
if there is a leak right if you do is
just<00:03:45.019> loosen<00:03:45.170> up<00:03:45.410> these<00:03:45.530> bolts<00:03:45.890> again<00:03:46.100> and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
just loosen up these bolts again and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.300 
just loosen up these bolts again and
just<00:03:46.370> slide<00:03:47.239> some<00:03:47.739> gasket<00:03:48.739> maker<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:49.130> there

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
just slide some gasket maker in there

exhaust<00:04:35.440> upward<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:37.300> remove<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.229> D<00:04:38.380> plate<00:04:38.710> and

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
exhaust upward to remove the D plate and

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.670 
exhaust upward to remove the D plate and
reinstall<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.039> bolts<00:04:42.490> as<00:04:42.699> needed<00:04:43.210> without

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
reinstall the bolts as needed without

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.250 
reinstall the bolts as needed without
having<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.860> pull<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.400> exhaust<00:04:45.729> out<00:04:46.060> now<00:04:46.960> if

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
having to pull the exhaust out now if

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.520 
having to pull the exhaust out now if
you're<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.650> rebuild<00:04:48.070> your<00:04:48.280> carburetors

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
you're going to rebuild your carburetors

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.900 
you're going to rebuild your carburetors
when<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:50.560> took<00:04:50.680> this<00:04:51.010> part<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.400> exhaust<00:04:51.669> out

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
when I took this part of the exhaust out

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.510 
when I took this part of the exhaust out
I<00:04:52.300> could<00:04:52.630> still<00:04:52.870> get<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.080> my<00:04:53.169> carburetors<00:04:53.710> okay

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
I could still get to my carburetors okay

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.219 
I could still get to my carburetors okay
so<00:04:55.270> if<00:04:55.599> you're<00:04:55.720> going<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.930> build<00:04:56.080> your

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
so if you're going to build your

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.930 
so if you're going to build your
carburetor<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.919> don't<00:04:57.190> have<00:04:57.520> to<00:04:57.759> take

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
carburetor so you don't have to take

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.790 
carburetor so you don't have to take
this<00:04:58.060> whole<00:04:58.210> exhaust<00:04:58.479> out<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:59.050> take<00:04:59.199> this

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
this whole exhaust out just take this

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.129 
this whole exhaust out just take this
part<00:05:00.130> out<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.639> you'll<00:05:01.330> have<00:05:01.479> access<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.900> all

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
part out and you'll have access to all

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.909 
part out and you'll have access to all
three<00:05:02.349> carbs<00:05:02.830> much<00:05:03.820> easier<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:05.680> will

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
three carbs much easier and this will

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.980 
three carbs much easier and this will
come<00:05:06.130> out<00:05:06.250> real<00:05:06.699> easy<00:05:07.000> now<00:05:07.150> because<00:05:07.690> it<00:05:07.780> kind

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
come out real easy now because it kind

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.649 
come out real easy now because it kind
of<00:05:08.050> converts<00:05:08.410> about<00:05:08.620> this<00:05:08.919> long<00:05:09.389> so<00:05:10.389> you<00:05:10.479> have

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
of converts about this long so you have

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.550 
of converts about this long so you have
to<00:05:10.810> pry<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.530> up<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.880> pull<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.180> out<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:14.020> now<00:05:14.289> that

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
to pry it up to pull it out but now that

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.939 
to pry it up to pull it out but now that
the<00:05:14.740> that<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.639> calculator<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.330> out<00:05:16.620> all<00:05:17.620> you

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
the that the calculator is out all you

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.700 
the that the calculator is out all you
have<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.159> do<00:05:18.280> is<00:05:18.400> keep<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.789> where<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.710> unbolt

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
have to do is keep it where it is unbolt
