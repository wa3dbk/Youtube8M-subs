lighter<00:04:18.350> weight<00:04:18.620> let's<00:04:19.070> start<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.340> pulldown

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
lighter weight let's start a pulldown

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.900 
lighter weight let's start a pulldown
and<00:04:20.180> we<00:04:20.330> like<00:04:20.510> contract<00:04:21.470> hard<00:04:21.790> contract<00:04:22.790> for

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
and we like contract hard contract for

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.940 
and we like contract hard contract for
full<00:04:23.150> seconds<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.840> time<00:04:24.080> under<00:04:24.410> contraction

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.000 
full seconds the time under contraction
it's<00:04:25.100> really<00:04:25.280> important<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:26.360> make<00:04:26.930> sure<00:04:27.770> you

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
it's really important so make sure you

that's right out next time let's say

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.120 
that's right out next time let's say

that each time in four forces you'll see

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.060 
that each time in four forces you'll see
it's<00:04:39.290> way<00:04:39.410> harder<00:04:40.090> all<00:04:41.090> right<00:04:41.320> number<00:04:42.320> 7<00:04:42.680> by

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
it's way harder all right number 7 by

remember being 17 but I didn't really
measure<00:05:12.020> back<00:05:12.290> then<00:05:12.470> but<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.400> was<00:05:13.640> like<00:05:14.020> like

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
measure back then but I was like like

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.190 
measure back then but I was like like
this<00:05:15.350> used<00:05:16.310> us<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.490> be<00:05:16.640> that<00:05:16.790> fat<00:05:16.970> are<00:05:17.780> two<00:05:18.110> of

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
this used us to be that fat are two of

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.080 
this used us to be that fat are two of
the<00:05:18.290> question<00:05:18.650> in<00:05:18.860> your<00:05:19.130> opinion<00:05:19.190> have<00:05:19.940> you

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
the question in your opinion have you

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.670 
the question in your opinion have you
been<00:05:20.210> able<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.780> same<00:05:21.020> amount<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.440> gains

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
been able to the same amount of gains

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.800 
been able to the same amount of gains
while<00:05:21.980> staying<00:05:22.250> clean<00:05:22.610> or<00:05:22.850> do<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:23.390> think<00:05:23.630> it's

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
while staying clean or do you think it's

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.360 
while staying clean or do you think it's
more<00:05:23.960> effective<00:05:24.169> for<00:05:24.530> yourself<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.250> get<00:05:25.340> a

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
more effective for yourself to get a

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.000 
more effective for yourself to get a
little<00:05:25.550> fatter<00:05:25.910> in<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.300> offseason<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:27.010> think

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
little fatter in the offseason I think

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.400 
little fatter in the offseason I think
it's<00:05:28.130> really<00:05:28.340> useless<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.910> have<00:05:29.060> excess<00:05:29.600> fat

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
it's really useless to have excess fat

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.200 
it's really useless to have excess fat
in<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.650> offseason<00:05:30.770> cuz<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:31.490> you'll<00:05:31.970> have<00:05:32.060> to

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
in the offseason cuz you you'll have to

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.850 
in the offseason cuz you you'll have to
lose<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.480> right<00:05:32.570> away<00:05:32.720> let's<00:05:33.020> say<00:05:33.140> you<00:05:33.200> gained

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
lose it right away let's say you gained

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.360 
lose it right away let's say you gained
like<00:05:34.390> 30<00:05:35.390> pounds<00:05:35.540> in<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.990> offseason<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.590> 20

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
like 30 pounds in the offseason and 20

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.040 
like 30 pounds in the offseason and 20
pounds<00:05:37.610> of<00:05:37.669> that<00:05:37.790> is<00:05:37.940> fat<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.300> 10<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:38.720> muscle

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
pounds of that is fat and 10 of muscle

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.080
