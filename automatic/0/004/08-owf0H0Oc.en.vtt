is designed to fit straight in and - it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
is designed to fit straight in and - it
is<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.399> upgraded<00:00:47.760> radiator<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.570> we'll<00:00:48.780> handle

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is an upgraded radiator so we'll handle

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.740 
is an upgraded radiator so we'll handle
the<00:00:49.440> off-roading<00:00:50.219> required<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.059> more

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the off-roading required and more

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.040 
the off-roading required and more
importantly<00:00:52.260> adequately<00:00:52.980> cool<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> engine

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
importantly adequately cool the engine

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.630 
importantly adequately cool the engine
with<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.379> new<00:00:55.620> generation<00:00:56.070> engines<00:00:56.430> they

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
with these new generation engines they

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
with these new generation engines they
are<00:00:56.699> full<00:00:56.969> electronic<00:00:57.390> engines<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.260> not

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
are full electronic engines so not

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.170 
are full electronic engines so not
something<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.670> want<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
actually had a loom sent up to Villa

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
actually had a loom sent up to Villa
custom<00:01:05.280> cables<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.000> been<00:01:06.150> completely

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
custom cables which has been completely

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.300 
custom cables which has been completely
modified<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.229> interfaces<00:01:07.619> directly<00:01:08.220> with

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
modified so it interfaces directly with

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
modified so it interfaces directly with
the<00:01:08.490> a/v<00:01:08.610> series<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> six<00:01:09.780> litre<00:01:09.990> loom

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the a/v series to the six litre loom

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
the a/v series to the six litre loom
which<00:01:10.680> makes<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.400> very<00:01:11.549> simple

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
which makes it a very very simple

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.270 
which makes it a very very simple
plug-and-play<00:01:12.479> installation<00:01:12.920> very<00:01:13.920> neat<00:01:14.130> as

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
plug-and-play installation very neat as

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.350 
plug-and-play installation very neat as
well<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.150> case<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
well so from here it's just a case of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
well so from here it's just a case of
stripping<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> old<00:01:19.500> Twitter<00:01:19.920> engine

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
most important part is that the vehicle
