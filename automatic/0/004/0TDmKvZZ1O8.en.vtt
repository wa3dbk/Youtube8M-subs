sky<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> show<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.520> do

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
sky is about to show us how you can do

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
sky is about to show us how you can do
it<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.360> walk<00:01:48.630> around<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it you can just walk around and you can

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.450 
it you can just walk around and you can
just<00:01:49.560> double<00:01:49.890> jump<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.630> right<00:01:51.899> there

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
just double jump up to here right there

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.039 
just double jump up to here right there
so<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.610> once<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.420> point<00:01:54.689> we

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so now once we get to this point we

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.569 
so now once we get to this point we
tweaked<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.619> little<00:01:55.649> bit<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
tweaked it a little bit this is going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
tweaked it a little bit this is going to
be<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.060> much<00:01:57.240> easier<00:01:57.299> than<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> other<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.530> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
be so much easier than the other way we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.069 
be so much easier than the other way we
wallbreach<00:01:59.130> from<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> other<00:01:59.729> video<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
wallbreach from the other video so the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
wallbreach from the other video so the
way<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.530> wha<00:02:01.680> breach<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.250> we're
