00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
stands out the most right now it's gonna

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
stands out the most right now it's gonna
be<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> sindelle<00:01:03.960> prime<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.739> started<00:01:05.400> off

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
be to the sindelle prime it started off

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.660

with<00:01:05.670> 85<00:01:06.180> base<00:01:06.479> damage<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
with 85 base damage and now it's up to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.179 
with 85 base damage and now it's up to
130<00:01:08.670> base<00:01:09.000> damage<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.810> has<00:01:10.110> 20%<00:01:10.530> critical

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
to go flying a lot farther so that's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
to go flying a lot farther so that's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
gonna be a really nice bit of utility

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000 
gonna be a really nice bit of utility
for<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.599> weapon<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.470> ask<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.830> to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
for that weapon so I can ask you to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.259 
for that weapon so I can ask you to
recommend<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.489> weapon<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.849> well

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
recommend that weapon as well

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.020 
recommend that weapon as well
now<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.870> crit<00:02:40.230> chance<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.709> only<00:02:41.129> up<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.340> 15%

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.660 
now the crit chance is only up to 15%
and<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.049> also<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.620> two<00:02:43.890> times<00:02:44.160> damage

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
which is nice but I would say it's still

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.430 
which is nice but I would say it's still
not<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.910> great<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.780> berserker<00:02:49.230> build

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
not that great for a berserker build
only<00:02:49.829> if<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.040> really<00:02:50.310> want<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.670> do<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.360> if

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
only if you really want to do it but if

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.569 
only if you really want to do it but if
you<00:02:51.569> want<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.019> heavy<00:02:52.440> melee<00:02:53.220> Berserker

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
could do it if you thought the weapon

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.050 
could do it if you thought the weapon
was<00:03:19.230> too<00:03:19.410> slow<00:03:19.650> especially<00:03:19.859> versus<00:03:20.400> infested

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
weird twist of fate the magic start not

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.620 
weird twist of fate the magic start not
really<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.230> great<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:49.950> buff<00:03:50.160> from<00:03:50.760> 5050

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
really that great of a buff from 5050

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.710 
really that great of a buff from 5050
damage<00:03:52.049> up<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.799> 80<00:03:53.130> damage<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.030> also<00:03:54.299> got<00:03:54.690> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
damage up to 80 damage but it also got a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.680 
damage up to 80 damage but it also got a
nerf<00:03:55.109> on<00:03:55.290> attack<00:03:55.650> speed<00:03:55.919> so<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:57.150> weapon<00:03:57.540> is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
nerf on attack speed so this weapon is

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.960 
nerf on attack speed so this weapon is
really<00:03:58.169> slow<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.739> doesn't<00:03:59.459> really<00:03:59.609> do<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.880> lot

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
really slow it doesn't really do a lot

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.960 
really slow it doesn't really do a lot
of<00:04:00.150> damage<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.889> did<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.459> its<00:04:02.609> critical

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
of damage but it did get its critical

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.089 
of damage but it did get its critical
chance<00:04:03.180> taking<00:04:03.569> up<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.840> 20%<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.829> that's

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
chance taking up to 20% and that's

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.770 
chance taking up to 20% and that's
actually<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.700> little<00:04:06.030> bit<00:04:06.209> more<00:04:06.359> berserker

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
actually a little bit more berserker

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.229 
actually a little bit more berserker
potential<00:04:07.380> but<00:04:08.099> because<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.849> weapon<00:04:09.120> is

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
potential but because the weapon is

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.210 
potential but because the weapon is
already<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.930> slow<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.440> doesn't<00:04:10.889> do<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.010> lot<00:04:11.099> of

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
already so slow it doesn't do a lot of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.250 
already so slow it doesn't do a lot of
damage<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.239> magic<00:04:12.419> star<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.870> gonna<00:04:13.019> be<00:04:13.139> my

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
damage so the magic star is gonna be my

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.900 
damage so the magic star is gonna be my
least<00:04:13.500> recommended<00:04:14.069> weapon<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.430> its<00:04:14.549> update

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
least recommended weapon in its update

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.089 
least recommended weapon in its update
and<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.810> cinder<00:04:16.079> prime<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.650> gonna<00:04:16.829> be<00:04:16.979> my

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
and the cinder prime is gonna be my

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.099 
and the cinder prime is gonna be my
absolute<00:04:17.310> top<00:04:17.970> recommendation<00:04:18.750> with<00:04:18.900> all

only now if you're using a rifle or a

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.910 
only now if you're using a rifle or a
secondary<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:26.280> you're<00:04:26.430> really<00:04:26.610> for

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
secondary and you're really for

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.800 
secondary and you're really for

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
that you're refocusing on shooting and

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.660 
that you're refocusing on shooting and
you<00:04:29.260> really<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.650> want<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.950> utility<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.520> a

you really just want the utility of a

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.210 
you really just want the utility of a
melee<00:04:30.880> weapon<00:04:30.970> I'd<00:04:31.690> say<00:04:32.080> go<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.440> jacket<00:04:32.980> tag

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
melee weapon I'd say go to jacket tag

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.070 
melee weapon I'd say go to jacket tag
that<00:04:33.760> knocked<00:04:34.030> down<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.540> ragdoll

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that knocked down and that ragdoll

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.990 
that knocked down and that ragdoll
that's<00:04:35.650> gonna<00:04:35.830> be<00:04:35.950> your<00:04:36.130> really<00:04:36.520> awesome

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
piece of utility for you so I hope this

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.840 
piece of utility for you so I hope this
helps<00:04:39.400> out

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
helps out

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.790 
helps out
I<00:04:39.880> think<00:04:40.510> these<00:04:40.690> buffs<00:04:41.110> will<00:04:41.350> really<00:04:41.650> help

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
I think these buffs will really help

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.250 
I think these buffs will really help
especially<00:04:42.160> on<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> cinder<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.180> ejector<00:04:44.050> tag

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
especially on the cinder and ejector tag

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.200 
especially on the cinder and ejector tag
and<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:44.860> think<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.340> really<00:04:45.700> brings<00:04:45.970> these

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
and I think this really brings these

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.960 
and I think this really brings these
weapons<00:04:46.660> into<00:04:47.140> a<00:04:47.380> little<00:04:47.980> bit<00:04:48.100> more<00:04:48.130> usability

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
weapons into a little bit more usability

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.300 
weapons into a little bit more usability
and<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.150> think<00:04:49.420> once<00:04:50.230> again<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.680> SEMO<00:04:50.920> Prime<00:04:51.160> in

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
and I think once again the SEMO Prime in

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.130 
and I think once again the SEMO Prime in
the<00:04:51.370> jacket<00:04:51.760> tech<00:04:51.940> are<00:04:52.150> definitely<00:04:52.720> weapons<00:04:53.020> I

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
the jacket tech are definitely weapons I

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.930 
the jacket tech are definitely weapons I
think<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.440> should<00:04:53.560> check<00:04:53.710> out<00:04:53.890> so<00:04:54.460> once<00:04:54.820> again
