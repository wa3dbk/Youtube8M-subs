00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
the new science that is the new physics

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.570 
the new science that is the new physics
of<00:00:04.200> quantum<00:00:04.319> mechanics<00:00:04.950> which<00:00:05.130> emphasizes

of quantum mechanics which emphasizes

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.789 
of quantum mechanics which emphasizes
that<00:00:05.970> it's<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.629> invisible<00:00:07.080> energy<00:00:07.319> world

that is primary in the material world is

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.990 
that is primary in the material world is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
your traits that's too bad you're stuck

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
your traits that's too bad you're stuck
with<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.410> genes<00:01:01.710> you're<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> victim<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.579> we

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
with your genes you're a victim so we

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.289 
with your genes you're a victim so we
teach<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.920> science<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.280> victimization<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
teach the science of victimization that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
teach the science of victimization that
your<00:01:06.570> fate<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.500> hands<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
your fate is not in your hands it's in

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
your fate is not in your hands it's in
your<00:01:08.280> genes<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.540> something<00:01:09.869> running<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
your genes you have something running in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
your genes you have something running in
your<00:01:10.290> family<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.670> might<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
your family then you might have to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670 
your family then you might have to
expect<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.350> way<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> life

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
expect that that's just a way of life

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
expect that that's just a way of life
and<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.070> had<00:01:14.250> nothing<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.090> but

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and you had nothing to do with it but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
and you had nothing to do with it but
you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.689> live<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.340> belief

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you have to live with it so that belief

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
you have to live with it so that belief
system<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> genetic<00:01:18.960> control<00:01:19.380> is

system of genetic control is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
system of genetic control is
transitioned<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.520> new<00:01:20.790> belief<00:01:21.150> system<00:01:21.630> in

transitioned into a new belief system in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140 
transitioned into a new belief system in
the<00:01:22.170> new<00:01:22.350> science<00:01:22.619> called<00:01:23.150> epigenetic

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the new science called epigenetic

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
same genetic control that means

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920
