directly<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.820> device<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.320> very

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
directly to your device which is very

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
directly to your device which is very
easy<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.220> well<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
easy to do as well and then the back of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.700 
easy to do as well and then the back of
it<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> believe<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> base<00:01:11.729> speaker

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
it I believe that's a base speaker

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.810 
it I believe that's a base speaker
because<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.040> has<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.400> weight<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
because this thing has some weight to it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
because this thing has some weight to it
not<00:01:15.060> heavy<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.840> weight<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.350> though<00:01:16.530> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
not heavy but weight like though you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.260 
not heavy but weight like though you
know<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> speaker<00:01:17.430> weight<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> magnitude

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
know the speaker weight the magnitude

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.030 
know the speaker weight the magnitude
