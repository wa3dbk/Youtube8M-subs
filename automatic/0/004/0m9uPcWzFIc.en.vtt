depending on how much time I have always

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.480 
depending on how much time I have always
make<00:01:59.320> sure<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.590> do<00:01:59.710> vertical<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.430> horizontal

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
make sure to do vertical and horizontal

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.180 
make sure to do vertical and horizontal
so<00:02:01.360> you<00:02:01.479> can<00:02:01.630> give<00:02:01.930> your<00:02:02.110> bride<00:02:02.320> an<00:02:02.650> option<00:02:03.100> of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
so you can give your bride an option of

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.010 
so you can give your bride an option of
each<00:02:03.280> for<00:02:03.880> her<00:02:04.000> album

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
each for her album

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.120 
each for her album
go

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.550 

and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:13.790> another<00:02:14.390> one<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> think<00:02:15.470> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and then another one that I think is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.490 
and then another one that I think is
super<00:02:15.710> fun<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.700> actually<00:02:17.200> place<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
super fun is if you actually place the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460 
super fun is if you actually place the
ring<00:02:18.710> inside<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.670> flower<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:21.290> get

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
ring inside of the flower and you get

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.650 
ring inside of the flower and you get
like<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.980> little<00:02:22.010> above<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.300> one<00:02:23.510> I've

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
like a little above it and this one I've

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.440 
like a little above it and this one I've
got<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:23.960> pink<00:02:24.470> flower<00:02:24.680> coming<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.000> front<00:02:26.300> so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
got this pink flower coming in front so

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.000 
got this pink flower coming in front so
it's<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.840> foreground<00:02:27.050> but<00:02:27.620> this

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
it's going to in the foreground but this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.050 
it's going to in the foreground but this
wouldn't<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.400> flowers<00:02:28.760> from<00:02:28.880> Whole<00:02:29.030> Foods

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
wouldn't be flowers from Whole Foods

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.640 
wouldn't be flowers from Whole Foods
this<00:02:29.570> would<00:02:29.780> be<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:29.990> her<00:02:30.110> bouquet

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
this would be in her bouquet

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.830 
this would be in her bouquet
so<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.100> would<00:02:31.220> be<00:02:31.390> sentimental<00:02:32.390> because<00:02:32.750> it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
so it would be sentimental because it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:44.010 
so it would be sentimental because it
would<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.110> her<00:02:33.230> bouquet<00:02:33.410> in<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.740> beautiful

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.750
