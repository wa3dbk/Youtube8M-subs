00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.560
 hi all and excellent tests 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.960
 mobile.fr today I propose you 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.240
 a grip a little bit a particular 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.070
 nokia n8 in pink version 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.410
 as you see so this is a 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.150
 official device that was announced and 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.560
 which is commercially available 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.720
 so I do not know if it's available 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.609
 currently in France is that it is 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.140
 in England in other countries it's 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.990
 still a little fuzzy about it 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.909
 so you'll excuse me at the level of 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.870
 content of the box we have the same thing 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:38.090
 only with the n8 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.910
 so it's not bad at all we have the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.630
 usb micro usb cable finally this is for 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.640
 the usb 2 go by good micro usb it is there 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.350
 this is the hdmi micro hdmi 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.350
 finally not micro it's mini hdmi 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.030
 In-ear headphones with 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.730
 remote control and the charger so the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.110
 second combine the classic box 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.520
 will be able to switch to the device so I want 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.460
 not do a device test for a 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.859
 simple reason is that if it's an n8 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.929
 who is just pink after his 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.450
 particularity is turning on the whole 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:12.439
 latest version of symbian touch that 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 is called symbian anna 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.700
 and that I will show you more in 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.329
 detail this bone at an incomparable in 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.710
 video with the original nokia n8 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:26.509
 by the way by talking to him I do not put 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.479
 right next so you see pink 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.770
 here is black one side we're going to do a 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.420
 little trick of the device but you 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.039
 will see it seems that the n8 so what 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.679
 is interesting on it is that he 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.749
 is pink and the outlines here that are 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.240
 supposed to be low they are black on the 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:46.639
 on the black n8 by the way so there they 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.840
 are black also ardently we had 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.250
 seen visuals that posted a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 an outline like that that was pink 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.770
 also and this is not the case we have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:01.049
 always this 3.5 inch screen in water the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.250
 sensors and the camera for video in 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.979
 below the menu button that is 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 always so flat I feel 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.330
 that he's even a little more on the side 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 right volume button then 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.340
 unlike the classical Inuit one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.440
 does not have this chrome side stated to know 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.580
 it may be a little bit less 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.560
 pretty but I do not know it's a question 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.819
 of taste after one is the button of 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.019
 lock unlock button 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.329
 camera that is still so 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.530
 well about the lock button 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.880
 unlock and I find that he has a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.319
 very small who stands out a little bit 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.150
 more than the button on the classic n8 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.440
 we'll say 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.910
 here we go we see well and suddenly 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.709
 makes it pretty good there 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.989
 the use it hangs more enough 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.400
 nice 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.920
 below we just have the port for the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.599
 load in case you want to use 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.390
 this classic loader there otherwise you 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.150
 use of micro USB ports here 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.470
 finally the cages for the micro sd and 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.819
 the asim years to the hdmi 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.040
 3.5 jack and button on off and then to 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.400
 the back always have of course 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.239
 aluminum 1 they have not changed that we have 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.280
 the nokia nseries logo what is like 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.470
 that and then he was like that on the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.549
 n8 in black I think it's a small 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.349
 little damage I would have with us 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.329
 that she puts the puts a little more in 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.739
 relief it's not dramatic but it's 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.410
 true it's a bit of a pity there it is 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.650
 it does not come out too much and the camera 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.660
 12 megapixel carl sayce with flash at 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.799
 classic xenon a spex level 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.500
 exactly the same thing 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.090
 it's a year plus an aspect that is who 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.019
 is different I do not know what you in 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.569
 think but I find it pretty 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.120
 friendly so we are born who are going 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.019
 to say it's a bit more feminine that's for sure 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.790
 it's true that I do not see myself working 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.139
 a pink device like that but 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.090
 now this is a question of 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.010
 taste and it's true that we who has 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.639
 proposed the n8 in full of different 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.739
 colors so that's pretty original and 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.239
 so if you want to get a glimpse of 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.950
 the interface of this device I'm going 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.190
 make a comparison with nokia n8 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.730
 in a future video 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.730
 see you soon
