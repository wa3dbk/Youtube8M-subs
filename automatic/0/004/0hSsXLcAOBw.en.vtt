and<00:00:21.369> as<00:00:22.369> you<00:00:23.210> might<00:00:23.359> guess<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.630> front<00:00:24.499> three

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
and as you might guess the front three

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.390 
and as you might guess the front three
are<00:00:24.769> a<00:00:24.800> piece<00:00:25.009> of<00:00:25.160> cake<00:00:26.589> but<00:00:27.589> the<00:00:27.679> back<00:00:27.919> three

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
are a piece of cake but the back three

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.229 
are a piece of cake but the back three
of<00:00:29.300> course<00:00:29.509> I've<00:00:29.659> got<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.640> plenum<00:00:31.640> cover<00:00:31.999> for

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
of course I've got the plenum cover for

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.299 
of course I've got the plenum cover for
the<00:00:32.329> intake<00:00:32.570> manifold<00:00:33.020> off<00:00:33.260> already<00:00:33.710> are

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
the intake manifold off already are

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.930 
the intake manifold off already are
completely<00:00:35.270> buried<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:36.590> since<00:00:37.489> I've<00:00:37.610> got<00:00:37.760> it

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
this plug there is a bracket back here

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.630 
this plug there is a bracket back here
back<00:00:53.809> left<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.769> there's<00:00:54.949> another<00:00:55.190> one<00:00:55.460> on<00:00:55.489> the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
back left and there's another one on the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.060 
back left and there's another one on the
back<00:00:55.910> right<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:57.710> connect<00:00:59.140> the<00:01:00.140> manifold<00:01:00.679> on

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
back right that connect the manifold on

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.840 
back right that connect the manifold on
the<00:01:01.699> backside<00:01:03.640> which<00:01:04.640> is<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> royal<00:01:05.120> pain<00:01:05.710> I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
the backside which is a royal pain I

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.400 
the backside which is a royal pain I
thought<00:01:07.850> there<00:01:08.120> was<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:08.540> these<00:01:08.720> seven<00:01:09.110> here

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
thought there was just these seven here

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.940 
thought there was just these seven here
one<00:01:09.560> two<00:01:09.800> three<00:01:10.130> four<00:01:10.400> five<00:01:10.640> six<00:01:10.940> seven<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:12.710> the

one two three four five six seven on the
top<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.400> were<00:01:13.550> obvious<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.060> see<00:01:14.270> there's

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
top that were obvious to see there's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.300 
top that were obvious to see there's
another<00:01:15.440> one<00:01:15.680> here<00:01:15.890> by<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.100> throttle<00:01:16.580> body

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.440 

right<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:23.230> of<00:01:24.230> course<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:25.090> one<00:01:26.090> has<00:01:26.330> to

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
right in here of course that one has to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.110 
right in here of course that one has to
just<00:01:26.510> come<00:01:26.870> loose<00:01:27.110> down<00:01:27.350> here<00:01:27.410> as<00:01:27.800> well<00:01:31.120> show

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
just come loose down here as well show

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.870 
just come loose down here as well show
you<00:01:32.180> where<00:01:32.450> they<00:01:32.630> are<00:01:32.660> at<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:35.170> intake

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
you where they are at the intake

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.300 
you where they are at the intake
manifold<00:01:37.880> here<00:01:38.530> upside<00:01:39.530> down<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:39.950> there

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
manifold here upside down but there

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.810 
manifold here upside down but there
connects<00:01:40.910> here<00:01:41.240> post<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.950> other<00:01:43.070> post<00:01:43.430> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
connects here post the other post and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.120 
connects here post the other post and
then<00:01:45.640> right<00:01:46.640> here<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:48.220> if<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:51.130> hopefully
