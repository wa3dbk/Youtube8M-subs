minecraft it's a really simple one

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
minecraft it's a really simple one
command<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.090> easily<00:00:51.330> implement<00:00:51.900> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
command that you can easily implement it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.840 
command that you can easily implement it
into<00:00:52.290> your<00:00:52.500> world<00:00:52.740> I'm<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.700> go

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
into your world I'm just going to go

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
ahead and paste this and click this here

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
ahead and paste this and click this here
and<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:57.330> I<00:00:57.420> said<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.870> relatively<00:00:58.410> small<00:00:58.830> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and as I said it's relatively small so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
and as I said it's relatively small so
it<00:00:59.340> won't<00:00:59.520> lag<00:00:59.700> your<00:00:59.940> world<00:01:00.150> too<00:01:00.540> much

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it won't lag your world too much

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
obviously just put in spawn chunks and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.220 
obviously just put in spawn chunks and
this<00:01:04.860> works<00:01:05.130> on<00:01:05.339> any<00:01:05.550> mob<00:01:05.940> and<00:01:06.210> also<00:01:06.960> on

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
this works on any mob and also on

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.010 
this works on any mob and also on
players<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.870> just<00:01:09.870> me<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.440> where<00:01:11.010> did<00:01:11.100> he<00:01:11.190> go

players and just me and where did he go
up<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.650> plus<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.190> B<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.940> right

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
up there we go a plus and B is right

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510 
up there we go a plus and B is right
here<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.660> help<00:01:15.840> me<00:01:15.960> demonstrate<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.800> if<00:01:17.400> we

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
here to help me demonstrate and if we

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.230 
here to help me demonstrate and if we
just<00:01:17.729> both<00:01:18.000> go<00:01:18.030> into<00:01:18.780> game<00:01:19.080> mode<00:01:19.110> 0<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.830> here

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
just both go into game mode 0 right here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
just both go into game mode 0 right here
we<00:01:21.240> should<00:01:21.300> be<00:01:21.450> able<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> demonstrate<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
we should be able to demonstrate that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.370 
we should be able to demonstrate that
and<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.850> walk<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> him<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.050> about

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and if I just walk up to him then about

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550 
and if I just walk up to him then about
2<00:01:25.680> blocks<00:01:25.830> sprint<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.060> hit<00:01:27.390> him<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:28.229> should

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
2 blocks sprint and hit him there should

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
2 blocks sprint and hit him there should
be<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.740> random<00:01:28.979> chance<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.790> stun<00:01:30.240> him

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
be a random chance that I can stun him

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.840 
be a random chance that I can stun him
let<00:01:30.600> me<00:01:30.660> try<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.869> again<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.610> see

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
let me try this again as you can see

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.780 
let me try this again as you can see
he's<00:01:33.479> been<00:01:33.720> stunned<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.410> now<00:01:34.920> he<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.400> try<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
he's been stunned and now he will try to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
he's been stunned and now he will try to
do<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.270> me<00:01:36.420> real<00:01:36.630> quick<00:01:37.910> see<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> trick

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
do it to me real quick see so the trick

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
do it to me real quick see so the trick
is<00:01:41.280> oh<00:01:41.550> there<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.180> go<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.900> see<00:01:43.140> i<00:01:43.320> have

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is oh there we go as you can see i have

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
is oh there we go as you can see i have
a<00:01:43.650> little<00:01:43.890> star<00:01:44.160> particle<00:01:44.640> effects<00:01:44.940> i<00:01:45.090> had

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
a little star particle effects i had

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.570 
a little star particle effects i had
over<00:01:45.360> my<00:01:45.539> head<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.929> I<00:01:46.710> spin<00:01:47.009> around<00:01:47.130> quickly

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
over my head and I spin around quickly

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.540 
over my head and I spin around quickly
and<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.630> slowly<00:01:48.869> gives<00:01:49.200> me<00:01:49.380> slowness<00:01:50.190> speeds

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
and it slowly gives me slowness speeds

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.450 
and it slowly gives me slowness speeds
slowness<00:01:51.119> speed<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.740> trick<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.160> is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
slowness speed so the trick to this is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.600 
slowness speed so the trick to this is
if<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.810> sprinting<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> hit<00:01:56.580> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
if you're sprinting and then you hit a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.880 
if you're sprinting and then you hit a
mob<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.600> there's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.110> random<00:01:58.470> chance<00:01:58.679> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
mob then there's a random chance that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.230 
mob then there's a random chance that
they<00:01:59.009> will<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.160> stunned<00:01:59.550> if<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.819> works<00:02:00.060> on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
they will be stunned if this works on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.169 
they will be stunned if this works on
any<00:02:00.509> mob<00:02:00.960> whatsoever<00:02:01.920> players<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:02.700> it's

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
any mob whatsoever players also it's

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.490 
any mob whatsoever players also it's
mostly<00:02:03.690> recommended<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.319> PvP<00:02:05.630> but<00:02:06.630> another

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
mostly recommended for PvP but another

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
mostly recommended for PvP but another
thing<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:07.979> note<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.490> there's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> better

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
thing to note is that there's a better

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
thing to note is that there's a better
chance<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.560> your<00:02:10.950> closest<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.850> them<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.210> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
chance if your closest to them when you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.270 
chance if your closest to them when you
start<00:02:12.600> sprinting<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.130> higher

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
start sprinting and you have a higher

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.220 
start sprinting and you have a higher
chance<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.640> stunning<00:02:15.000> them<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.569> less<00:02:15.750> damage

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
chance of stunning them the less damage

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.200 
chance of stunning them the less damage
you<00:02:16.350> deal<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.100> you're<00:02:17.220> using<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.610> sword<00:02:17.940> or

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
you deal so if you're using a sword or

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.150 
you deal so if you're using a sword or
something<00:02:18.660> actually<00:02:18.840> used<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.470> hurt<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.950> mob

there's<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.910> very<00:02:21.270> low<00:02:21.480> chance<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.870> will<00:02:21.930> stun

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
there's a very low chance you will stun

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.290 
there's a very low chance you will stun
them<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.620> say<00:02:22.980> you're<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.220> using<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.640> stick<00:02:24.060> or

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
there will be a rather high chance of

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.300 
there will be a rather high chance of
stunning<00:02:30.480> them<00:02:30.630> as<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.650> see<00:02:31.860> right<00:02:31.890> there

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
stunning them as you can see right there

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.270 
stunning them as you can see right there
on<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.459> villager<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.920> red<00:02:35.040> stones

on the villager and the red stones

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.940 
on the villager and the red stones
pretty<00:02:35.610> simple<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> main<00:02:37.410> stuff<00:02:37.709> that's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
pretty simple but the main stuff that's

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.740 
pretty simple but the main stuff that's
going<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.819> just<00:02:38.850> do<00:02:39.150> scoreboard

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
going on here so if I just do scoreboard

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.949 
going on here so if I just do scoreboard
objectives<00:02:40.380> set<00:02:41.040> display<00:02:41.280> sidebar<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.300> I

objectives set display sidebar and I

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.559 
objectives set display sidebar and I
just<00:02:42.990> set<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.740> sprint<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.270> see

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
just set that to sprint here you can see

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.210 
just set that to sprint here you can see
that<00:02:46.160> when<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.190> sprint<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.560> have<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> temporary

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that when I sprint I have a temporary

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.930 
that when I sprint I have a temporary
little<00:02:50.700> score<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.239> goes<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.599> for<00:02:51.810> about<00:02:52.049> 4

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
little score that goes up for about 4

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.270

really<00:03:03.530> fluid<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:05.750> wanted<00:03:05.990> to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
really fluid I just wanted to

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.720 
really fluid I just wanted to
demonstrate<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.710> multiplayer<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.580> as

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
you can see a lot of it is pretty choppy

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.610 
you can see a lot of it is pretty choppy
but<00:03:10.370> as<00:03:10.490> you<00:03:10.610> can<00:03:10.670> see<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.600> sprint<00:03:12.020> there<00:03:12.380> is

but as you can see but I sprint there is
a<00:03:12.650> slight<00:03:13.250> just<00:03:13.610> like<00:03:13.850> three<00:03:14.270> second<00:03:14.690> little

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
a slight just like three second little

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.470 
a slight just like three second little
thing<00:03:15.230> after<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.100> start<00:03:16.430> sprinting<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.060> when<00:03:17.450> I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
thing after I start sprinting and when I

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.010 
thing after I start sprinting and when I
deal<00:03:17.720> damage<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:19.040> about<00:03:19.510> well<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.630> can't<00:03:20.870> see

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
deal damage for about well you can't see

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.110 
deal damage for about well you can't see
it<00:03:21.140> right<00:03:21.170> here<00:03:21.290> before<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.190> split<00:03:22.670> second

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
it right here before I split second

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.220

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.110 
there I have a little damage score um
maybe<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:27.680> change<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.460> to<00:03:29.090> something

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
maybe if I just change this to something

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.620 
maybe if I just change this to something
else<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.870> should<00:03:29.990> be<00:03:30.230> able<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.940> hire<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.270> and

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
else I should be able to hire it and

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.980 
else I should be able to hire it and
then<00:03:33.140> you'll<00:03:33.350> be<00:03:33.500> able<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:34.630> see<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:35.930> a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
then you'll be able to see it for a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.950 
then you'll be able to see it for a
second<00:03:36.610> it's<00:03:37.610> somewhere<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.090> here<00:03:38.330> oh<00:03:38.510> also

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
second it's somewhere in here oh also

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.770 
second it's somewhere in here oh also
here's<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.530> actual<00:03:39.680> thing<00:03:39.920> that's<00:03:40.190> happening

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
here's the actual thing that's happening

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.560 
here's the actual thing that's happening
when<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.960> have<00:03:42.230> both<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.280> sprint<00:03:43.790> score<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.360> one

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
when you have both a sprint score of one

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.780 
when you have both a sprint score of one
and<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:45.050> damaged<00:03:45.470> score<00:03:45.770> of<00:03:45.860> one<00:03:46.040> then<00:03:46.640> what

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and a damaged score of one then what

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.750 
and a damaged score of one then what
will<00:03:46.940> happen<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.540> will<00:03:47.990> set<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:49.310> nearest

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
will happen is it will set the nearest

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.530 
will happen is it will set the nearest
mob<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.330> has<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:53.000> within<00:03:53.240> three

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
mob that has a that is within three

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.080 
mob that has a that is within three
blocks<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.140> but<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:55.070> no<00:03:55.430> one<00:03:55.700> than<00:03:55.850> one

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
blocks of you but is no one than one

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.699 
blocks of you but is no one than one
block<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:56.780> which<00:03:57.050> is<00:03:57.230> kind<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.500> specific

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
block of you which is kind of specific

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.400 
block of you which is kind of specific
and<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.090> means<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.480> can<00:03:59.600> also<00:03:59.780> be<00:03:59.930> done<00:04:00.230> to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
and so this means it can also be done to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.470 
and so this means it can also be done to
splash<00:04:00.830> mobs<00:04:01.280> like<00:04:01.640> if<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.880> have<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.030> small

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
splash mobs like if you have a small

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.990 
splash mobs like if you have a small
group<00:04:02.750> of<00:04:02.870> mobs<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.380> use<00:04:03.440> Donna<00:04:03.800> then<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.790> can

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
group of mobs and use Donna then you can

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.890 
group of mobs and use Donna then you can
sometimes<00:04:05.480> get<00:04:05.750> multiple<00:04:06.500> ones<00:04:07.660> yep<00:04:08.660> here<00:04:08.870> it

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
sometimes get multiple ones yep here it

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.410 
sometimes get multiple ones yep here it
is<00:04:09.050> so<00:04:09.350> when<00:04:10.100> they<00:04:10.220> have<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.400> damaged<00:04:10.820> score<00:04:11.150> one

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
is so when they have a damaged score one

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.699 
is so when they have a damaged score one
which<00:04:11.630> means<00:04:11.900> they<00:04:12.080> did<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> little<00:04:12.530> bit<00:04:12.680> of

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
which means they did a little bit of

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.470 
which means they did a little bit of
damage<00:04:12.920> by<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.489> way<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.790> sprint<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.420> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
damage by the way the sprint and the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.860 
damage by the way the sprint and the
damage<00:04:14.870> our<00:04:15.020> stats<00:04:15.560> prints<00:04:16.340> damage<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.720> get

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
damage our stats prints damage you get

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.050 
damage our stats prints damage you get
the<00:04:18.020> idea<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.799> as<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:18.950> do<00:04:19.130> damage<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.640> adds<00:04:19.820> it

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
the idea so as you do damage it adds it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.420 
the idea so as you do damage it adds it
to<00:04:20.090> five<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.810> then<00:04:20.870> if<00:04:21.799> we<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.070> find<00:04:22.250> the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
to five and then if we can find the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.350 
to five and then if we can find the
score<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:23.540> just<00:04:23.780> keeps<00:04:24.020> adding<00:04:24.290> five<00:04:24.800> up<00:04:25.360> until

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
score it just keeps adding five up until

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.740 
score it just keeps adding five up until
uh<00:04:26.830> well<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.280> one<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.580> these<00:04:28.669> here<00:04:28.910> up<00:04:29.210> until

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
uh well it's one of these here up until

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.440 
uh well it's one of these here up until
it<00:04:29.990> gets<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.290> 50<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.550> sets<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.940> zero<00:04:32.270> so

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
it gets to 50 and it sets it to zero so

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.930 
it gets to 50 and it sets it to zero so
if<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.720> do<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.960> lot<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.350> initial<00:04:33.860> damage<00:04:34.100> then

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
if you do a lot of initial damage then

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.250 
if you do a lot of initial damage then
it<00:04:35.810> will<00:04:36.400> reset<00:04:37.400> very<00:04:37.850> very<00:04:38.090> quickly<00:04:38.390> but<00:04:39.140> if

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
it will reset very very quickly but if

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.280 
it will reset very very quickly but if
you<00:04:39.440> don't<00:04:39.770> then<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:41.360> will<00:04:41.570> take<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.840> lot<00:04:42.080> longer

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
you don't then it will take a lot longer

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.880 
you don't then it will take a lot longer
so<00:04:42.500> you<00:04:42.710> have<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.340> little<00:04:43.760> longer<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.840> time<00:04:45.110> so

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
so you have a little longer of a time so

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.800 
so you have a little longer of a time so
and<00:04:46.310> there's<00:04:46.520> obviously<00:04:46.669> particle<00:04:47.540> effects

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
and there's obviously particle effects

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.960 
and there's obviously particle effects
and<00:04:48.020> sound<00:04:48.200> effects<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:49.160> nice<00:04:49.310> thing<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.550> this

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
and sound effects the nice thing is this

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.480 
and sound effects the nice thing is this
doesn't<00:04:50.330> use<00:04:50.419> any<00:04:50.540> external<00:04:51.020> entities<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.280> it

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
doesn't use any external entities so it

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.850 
doesn't use any external entities so it
can<00:04:52.640> be<00:04:52.760> done<00:04:52.940> anywhere<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.750> world<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.320> any

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
can be done anywhere in the world on any

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.970 
can be done anywhere in the world on any
player<00:04:55.250> on<00:04:55.280> any<00:04:55.700> entity<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:57.770> pretty

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
player on any entity so it's pretty
