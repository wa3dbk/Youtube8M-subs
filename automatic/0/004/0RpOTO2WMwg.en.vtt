you have to put the like in front of

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.669 
you have to put the like in front of
blowhole<00:00:35.719> because<00:00:36.079> that's<00:00:36.260> where<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> most

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
blowhole because that's where the most

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.919 
blowhole because that's where the most
of<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:36.980> sound<00:00:37.250> resonates<00:00:37.690> probably<00:00:38.690> ninety

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929 
of the sound resonates probably ninety

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.599 
of the sound resonates probably ninety
eight<00:00:39.050> nine<00:00:39.320> ninety<00:00:39.890> nine<00:00:39.920> percent<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.519> the

eight nine ninety nine percent of the

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.540 
eight nine ninety nine percent of the
sound<00:00:40.820> comes<00:00:41.329> from<00:00:41.539> right<00:00:41.719> here<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.829> you<00:00:43.519> have

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
sound comes from right here so you have

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.819 
sound comes from right here so you have
to<00:00:43.789> put<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.600> mic<00:00:44.809> in<00:00:44.960> front<00:00:44.989> but<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.589> downside

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
to put the mic in front but the downside

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.279 
to put the mic in front but the downside
is<00:00:46.390> that's<00:00:47.390> also<00:00:47.870> where<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.140> fluids<00:00:48.499> blows

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
is that's also where the fluids blows

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.009 
is that's also where the fluids blows
and<00:00:51.289> because<00:00:51.679> of<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:51.949> there<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:52.249> air<00:00:53.019> insult

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
and because of that there is air insult

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.819 
and because of that there is air insult
when<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:54.350> might<00:00:54.559> conclude<00:00:56.050> if<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:57.260> aim<00:00:57.530> right

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
when you might conclude if you aim right

get<00:01:44.539> something<00:01:44.930> called<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.229> proximity

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
get something called the proximity

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.740

three<00:01:51.859> or<00:01:52.009> four<00:01:52.039> inches<00:01:52.430> away<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:53.060> get<00:01:53.780> on<00:01:53.930> your

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
three or four inches away I get on your

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.620 
three or four inches away I get on your
like<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.619> almost<00:01:55.399> like<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:55.969> see<00:01:56.149> me<00:01:56.210> right<00:01:56.479> up

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
like this almost like it see me right up

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.139 
like this almost like it see me right up
tip<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.140> my<00:01:57.259> nose<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:59.679> by<00:02:00.679> doing<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.490> get

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
tip of my nose and by doing that I get

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.469 
tip of my nose and by doing that I get
probably<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.689> most<00:02:02.929> true<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.299> repre<00:02:05.299> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
probably the most true and repre to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.080 
probably the most true and repre to
represent<00:02:05.990> sound<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.679> flute<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.340> no

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
represent sound on the flute and no

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.900 
represent sound on the flute and no
setup<00:02:08.479> that's<00:02:08.720> what<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:08.960> do<00:02:09.110> when<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.470> do
