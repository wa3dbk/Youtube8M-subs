bandwidth to work with right it does but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.160

they're<00:01:56.790> probably<00:01:57.000> using<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> most<00:01:57.719> advanced

they're probably using the most advanced

they're probably using the most advanced

they're both using mpeg-4 not 100% yet

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.780 
they're both using mpeg-4 not 100% yet
but<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.259> close<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.490> hard<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
but very close to it so it's hard to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
but very close to it so it's hard to
make<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> direct<00:02:06.509> comparison<00:02:06.960> between<00:02:06.990> SE<00:02:07.500> and

was type company uh it compared that
directly<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.840> your<00:02:16.319> satellite<00:02:16.620> providers<00:02:17.069> who

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
directly to your satellite providers who

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.309 
directly to your satellite providers who
say<00:02:17.459> say<00:02:17.819> satellites<00:02:18.329> using<00:02:18.510> 12<00:02:18.870> megabit<00:02:19.290> per

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
say say satellites using 12 megabit per

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.500 
say say satellites using 12 megabit per
channel<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.640> they're<00:02:20.760> using<00:02:20.969> a<00:02:21.180> more

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
channel and but they're using a more

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.539 
channel and but they're using a more
efficient<00:02:21.870> codec<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.349> essentially<00:02:22.859> say<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
efficient codec which essentially say is

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.759 
efficient codec which essentially say is
100%<00:02:24.390> better<00:02:24.689> so<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.079> effectively<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
100% better so it's effectively is

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.280 
100% better so it's effectively is
acting<00:02:26.069> like<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.370> 24<00:02:26.939> megabits<00:02:27.269> stream<00:02:27.629> that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
acting like a 24 megabits stream that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.379 
acting like a 24 megabits stream that
would<00:02:28.469> be<00:02:28.620> adequate<00:02:29.129> for<00:02:29.159> any<00:02:29.459> broadcast<00:02:30.209> HD

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
would be adequate for any broadcast HD

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.860 
would be adequate for any broadcast HD
stream<00:02:30.840> out<00:02:31.049> there<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.359> in<00:02:33.359> my<00:02:33.510> personal

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
stream out there so I in my personal

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.059 
stream out there so I in my personal
experience<00:02:33.989> I'm<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.409> to<00:02:34.469> say<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> yes<00:02:34.889> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
experience I'm going to say that yes the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.709 
experience I'm going to say that yes the
satellite<00:02:35.430> content<00:02:36.120> does<00:02:36.299> look<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> little

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
satellite content does look a little

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.720 
satellite content does look a little
softer<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.230> my<00:02:37.349> eye<00:02:37.379> then<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.219> do<00:02:38.280> see<00:02:38.549> from

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
softer to my eye then I do see from

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.220 
softer to my eye then I do see from
cable<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.150> haven't<00:02:39.480> had<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.599> lot<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.870> experience

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
have Comcast see if any of your

stuff you like and see if you see

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.270 
stuff you like and see if you see
difference<00:03:34.199> because<00:03:34.470> price<00:03:34.680> comparison<00:03:35.189> -

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
difference because price comparison -

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.349 
difference because price comparison -
because<00:03:35.459> there<00:03:35.549> might<00:03:35.699> be<00:03:35.729> differences<00:03:36.239> you

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
because there might be differences you

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.460 
because there might be differences you
might<00:03:36.449> get<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.599> better<00:03:36.750> deal<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.199> like<00:03:37.290> okay

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
might get a better deal it's like okay

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.229 
might get a better deal it's like okay
that<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.739> over<00:03:37.979> I<00:03:38.099> did<00:03:38.310> everything<00:03:38.579> right<00:03:39.000> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that just over I did everything right a

that just over I did everything right a
significantly<00:03:39.989> better<00:03:40.109> deal<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.709> I'm<00:03:40.829> gonna

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
significantly better deal and I'm gonna

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.409 
significantly better deal and I'm gonna
say<00:03:41.129> symmetrical<00:03:41.609> bandwidth<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.120> really

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
say symmetrical bandwidth is really

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.119 
say symmetrical bandwidth is really
attractive<00:03:42.900> cuz<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.409> can<00:03:43.799> get<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:43.949> hundred

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
attractive cuz I can get a hundred

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.619 
attractive cuz I can get a hundred
megabit<00:03:44.609> from<00:03:44.729> Comcast<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.269> I'm<00:03:45.329> afraid<00:03:45.449> to

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
megabit from Comcast but I'm afraid to

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.179 
megabit from Comcast but I'm afraid to
add<00:03:45.780> or<00:03:45.989> Xfinity<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.620> not<00:03:46.739> sure<00:03:46.919> what<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.129> call

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
add or Xfinity I'm not sure what to call

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.979 
add or Xfinity I'm not sure what to call
them<00:03:47.400> anymore<00:03:47.639> but<00:03:47.849> option<00:03:48.180> I'm<00:03:48.629> not<00:03:48.840> sure

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
them anymore but option I'm not sure

them anymore but option I'm not sure
what<00:03:49.199> that's<00:03:49.319> gonna<00:03:49.530> run<00:03:49.709> me<00:03:49.799> probably<00:03:50.040> more

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
what that's gonna run me probably more

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.679 
what that's gonna run me probably more
than<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.370> wanted<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.609> pay<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:51.269> other<00:03:51.419> thing<00:03:51.569> to

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
than I wanted to pay the other thing to

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.640 
than I wanted to pay the other thing to
keep<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.870> mind<00:03:52.019> -<00:03:52.139> if<00:03:52.229> you<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.379> a<00:03:52.409> large

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
keep in mind - if you have a large

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.929 
keep in mind - if you have a large
household<00:03:53.129> you're<00:03:53.340> driving<00:03:53.609> lots<00:03:53.819> of

household you're driving lots of

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.640 
household you're driving lots of
televisions<00:03:54.449> you<00:03:54.599> might<00:03:54.870> be<00:03:55.139> limited<00:03:55.560> in

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
televisions you might be limited in

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.539 
televisions you might be limited in
terms<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.979> how<00:03:56.040> many<00:03:56.310> channels

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
terms of how many channels

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.789 
terms of how many channels
simultaneously<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:57.900> watch<00:03:58.290> different

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
simultaneously you can watch different

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.649 
simultaneously you can watch different
channels<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.489> once<00:03:59.519> within<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.180> household

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
channels at once within that household

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.110 
channels at once within that household
using<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.310> basically<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.370> bit<00:04:02.549> delivery<00:04:02.849> system

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
using a basically a bit delivery system

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.149 
using a basically a bit delivery system
over<00:04:03.479> fibre<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.680> one<00:04:04.829> thing<00:04:05.009> to<00:04:05.069> keep

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
over fibre that's just one thing to keep

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.409 
over fibre that's just one thing to keep
in<00:04:05.250> mind<00:04:05.400> I'd<00:04:05.579> actually<00:04:05.939> like<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> know<00:04:06.299> if

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
in mind I'd actually like to know if

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.629 
in mind I'd actually like to know if
anybody<00:04:06.689> has<00:04:06.810> like<00:04:07.049> six<00:04:07.889> TVs<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.400> their<00:04:08.489> house

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
anybody has like six TVs in their house

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.949 
anybody has like six TVs in their house
and<00:04:08.909> how<00:04:09.030> they<00:04:09.180> deal<00:04:09.329> with<00:04:09.389> that<00:04:09.540> they<00:04:09.659> have<00:04:09.810> to

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
and how they deal with that they have to

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.629 
and how they deal with that they have to
run<00:04:10.049> two<00:04:10.319> separate<00:04:10.739> connections<00:04:11.129> maybe<00:04:11.340> could

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
run two separate connections maybe could

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.280 
run two separate connections maybe could
dry<00:04:11.819> up<00:04:11.879> any<00:04:12.150> dishes<00:04:12.419> they<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.989> have<00:04:13.109> on

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
dry up any dishes they have to have on

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.809 
dry up any dishes they have to have on
the<00:04:13.409> roof<00:04:13.590> or<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.919> well<00:04:14.129> for<00:04:14.459> dish<00:04:14.609> would<00:04:14.790> be

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
the roof or that well for dish would be

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.339 
the roof or that well for dish would be
a<00:04:14.909> little<00:04:15.120> bit<00:04:15.239> easier<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.659> but<00:04:16.139> for

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
a little bit easier I think but for

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.319 
a little bit easier I think but for
fibre<00:04:17.159> it's<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.549> those<00:04:17.729> are<00:04:17.849> bits<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.239> it's

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
fibre it's like those are bits and it's

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.180 
fibre it's like those are bits and it's
like<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.539> can<00:04:18.659> only<00:04:18.780> put<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.650> many<00:04:19.889> bits

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
like you can only put so many bits

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.120 
like you can only put so many bits
through<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.519> copper<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:22.500> one<00:04:22.800> thing<00:04:23.039> to

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
through that copper so just one thing to

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520 
through that copper so just one thing to
keep<00:04:23.219> in<00:04:23.340> mind
