00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 how am i nor with magnet pencil of supra 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.930
 pixel and today we are going to do the analysis 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.429
 of the xxvi beatbox light 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.870
 do not forget that under the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.160
 description I'm going to leave a link for 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.170
 that they can know their price in 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 mercadolibre and of course compare it 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 against other prices other sellers to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.270
 see who gives them cheaper because 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 good is a good way to get it 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.020
 It is a product that is not very expensive so 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.490
 less for what it offers so review 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.570
 they can even check the prices 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.970
 while listening to what I'm going 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.769
 saying we start here we have the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
 beatbox light consisting of a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.640
 speaker and base load the base 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.140
 of charge consists of the following is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 a magnetic base is to say when 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.850
 approach the speaker to the base is going to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
 attract logically by magnetism and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.940
 besides, not only do we have here a 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 microusb connector to be able to charge 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 directly from the base to the speaker or 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.840
 we connect the cable here and start 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 to load but also has a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.899
 internal battery so when it 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 we finish the speaker battery 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.710
 simply issue supporting it at the base 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.719
 and even if it's not connected, it's going to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.359
 start loading, notice that there appears 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.800
 a very very dim red need that we 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.570
 indicates that you are just loading a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.409
 Once it gets green it 's because it's over 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.689
 to load 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.039
 So, let's also have the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.509
 good load base just one 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.219
 non-slip rubber band 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.469
 it's just going to prevent it from slipping 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.670
 both at the base and the speaker and 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.920
 let's talk about the speaker itself 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.179
 It also has an anti-slip base to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 switch side on and off 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.500
 it will also prevent it from slipping 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.329
 obviously the base slides a lot 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
 less because it has much more surface area 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.659
 rubber and I think we have good here 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.969
 obviously here inside they are for 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.729
 go ahead under this color grid 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.840
 red orange also comes in light blue 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.880
 tell me below the opposites what is the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.289
 that he likes more and then in the part 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 top is the most interesting we have 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.140
 a touch panel where we can 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.239
 simply touching you do not have to press 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.099
 lower or raise the volume go back 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.569
 or forward in a song pause or 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.399
 summarize and then if we keep 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.020
 pressed here we have also for 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.179
 make calls via bluetooth through 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.259
 our phone with the microphone that 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.149
 we have in the parliament 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 we hear who speaks to us by the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.640
 speaker and that person also we 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 listen to us through this 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.079
 microphone I tried it and it works very very 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 alright so let's start the speaker 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.759
 Bone, let's light 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 and there you are turn on let's see what 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.300
 it flashes because it is just looking 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.039
 what to connect all the bluetooth 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.569
 but not only do we have bluetooth but 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.370
 also that we have nfc so 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.560
 we grab in this case a motorcycle x go to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.209
 approaching we see that there is connect 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.200
 we hope a little bit we are going to say that 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.080
 yes we want to connect it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.580
 and there we can already pass music we are going to 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.580
 start any topic 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.570
 see that I just passed the song without 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.570
 emits by tapping on this touch button 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.959
 you may not realize it but to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.370
 basket the maximum volume already in itself 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.440
 it sounds quite loud when 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.310
 we climb to the maximum we hear 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.530
 terribly strong is like vision a 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.030
 whole room very easily and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.019
 the truth that this is not very normal was 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.879
 a speaker of this size is 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.310
 awesome how loud it sounds is 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.930
 really terrible but not only 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.269
 It sounds strong but it also sounds very 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.250
 well now factory sounds good but no 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.260
 more than that why I say this because 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.750
 I discovered that the means are very 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.830
 up I do not know why now when 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.700
 Equalize a little bit the speaker is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.349
 impressive the sound quality that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.120
 this speaker will be achieved Hernandez is 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.860
 really amazing what is the key 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.810
 simply that to lower a little 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.340
 means after that I'm going to 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.780
 show now with a little more detail 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.579
 how do I update what is the best 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.230
 equalization settings that I achieved 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.519
 with this speaker to be heard 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.319
 simply spectacular 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.970
 now as you can see it 's a matter of 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.769
 simply raise the basses a little 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.239
 download a little bit the means and then 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.130
 raise a little more the treble ones a 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.230
 very basic configuration do not have for 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.540
 what to achieve with this amount of bands 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.370
 that are a lot simply with more 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.900
 or less imitate the same with any 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.240
 another equalizer will achieve some 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.700
 broadly similar results 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.020
 to achieve a sound quality that is 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.920
 terrible considering the size of this 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.660
 talking 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.550
 the color volume is also impressive 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.830
 it's outrageously ridiculous it's very easy 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.440
 fill a full room now if 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.570
 they ask me I think the best way to 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.800
 listen with this plan to listen 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.480
 normal quiet because we are not 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.370
 studying we are reading we are 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.410
 doing normal things from home with the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.450
 speaker not to the maximum and really 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.100
 listen barbarian is awesome 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.320
 we get the size and the price that 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.420
 It has is terrible I can not say it 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.220
 a clearer way the funny thing is that 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.530
 when we grab the speaker it vibrates 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.190
 you know the answer is impressive 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.190
 low you have 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.720
 Here is something that I really liked and it is the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.120
 battery life because really 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.640
 I could get to listen to almost 15 records 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800
 with only one speaker load and 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.690
 also on top after giving more charge 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.970
 with the base that comes more or less to 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.000
 almost 5 discs more then the truth that 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.250
 hard battery a lot I really liked to 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.020
 the hour that breaks it for me 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.850
 also as a conclusion the truth that the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.380
 beatbox side you break our 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.360
 products that are some gems that 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.420
 we find very occasionally and that 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.800
 They are very good and they have a price 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.330
 very cheap basically what happens with 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.430
 the motorcycle gp is not basically the motorcycle that 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.780
 of the two mobile speakers that is 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.120
 a very good battery life and a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.190
 External charging base that also has 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.920
 the battery has nfc 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.860
 sounds like a barbarian I do not have any complaints or 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.470
 it's great it's just that 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.820
 so if you know I did not try one 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.890
 day I got the comments they thought 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.720
 if they would buy it or not, I am also 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.290
 nicola fishman and see you in the next 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.290
 videos 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.870
 do not 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900
 Look 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.900
 do not
