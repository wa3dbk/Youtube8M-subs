00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.289
 I hope it takes all the new video 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.139
 tutorial I extract this program that 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.620
 basically it serves to change your ip the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.660
 case you are already 2 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.900
 this tells us that it works so that 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.550
 change everything from one account to one 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.200
 specified account in addition to having 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.730
 tomorrow two hundred accounts but that you 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.320
 have downloaded the ip because we can not 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.660
 enter that server what to say 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.739
 that this works to know what it is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.310
 that is minecraft etcetera not many 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.890
 different games 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:50.450
 now in the description of life in the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:57.080
 link you can load is this program 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.090
 is to run it install it installed is 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.240
 say the installation 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.510
 it's true but the cheese is this 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.720
 [Music] 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.220
 and ready not once installed 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.430
 disappeared like this one that will be in 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:16.540
 red christ and disconnected now 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:21.550
 there's advertising where they double- click 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.260
 although we are here to do this without 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.260
 protect other times in English 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.770
 to change it only with the language 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.010
 or language disappears and select 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.010
 Spanish 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.880
 but from this 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.270
 well once we connect 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.780
 We hope you protect us with the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.780
 ife changes 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.700
 we wait for them to load and once 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.280
 here we have pepe will have been 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.970
 changed by the one you see here we are in 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.869
 a network or can be a host in the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.380
 united states and so you can already be 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.750
 enter to play but before that this one 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.190
 have to have 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.240
 this 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.210
 a detail not at the time of toast and you 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.420
 be the program 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.220
 we will be able to enter basically but if 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.680
 your moment of entrance of the preside close 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.520
 the program is already behind 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.990
 it will automatically do it again 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.390
 the same y and the server 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.300
 to detect the faith that you had vanity and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.740
 is going to draw you back then always 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.600
 you can play you have to have this 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.510
 program always open yes yes yes 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.420
 always open that strength because if not 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.630
 the closes are something else and you are 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.960
 adding the server will vote you as 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.970
 I said this besides living for the ip 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.770
 it's not for them to go is an account 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.090
 specific with a certain name but that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.650
 it's basically free once it's already 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.440
 you do not want to play 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:17.680
 pauses the pause stay in the last 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:21.400
 option unite the breaks and once done 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.960
 so can the program be and teach 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.170
 the lights that want to play like this you can 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.170
 do
