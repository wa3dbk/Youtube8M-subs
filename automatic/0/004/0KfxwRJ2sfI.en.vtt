00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.700
 yes we have now we have here now 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.679
 holiday package will get that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.929
 our experience just around 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:20.310
 well and there is so much fun 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.710
 Waffenrock without that was just that is not a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.609
 real wattenbach has activated such a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 world of warcraft 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.029
 why can so well is now 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:43.350
 the idea and now it was the topic 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:45.500
 I believe in the presence there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500
 Not 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 I still do not believe that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.580
 i hate it when kasseler interrupted 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 and to vomit I break too 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.810
 one at a time and German is for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 do not break anymore 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.970
 I really wanted everyone is this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.670
 week but somehow I have 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 that did not make it that's mine 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.130
 Ambition fight with full 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.159
 So not after this never after 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:41.939
 the next 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:43.110
 alex is equal need given his 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.210
 points ago lay with a character 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.740
 yes yes, 53 percent think I have it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.630
 That is really cool when you are 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.939
 I only really drink choice 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.619
 rice balls that I grief everything 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.619
 another time a creative latte in the moment 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.530
 yes, that's true at some point 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.990
 read that they want to change it too 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.580
 that is one of his group 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.740
 awesome is that then drinks 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.270
 should come more quickly to respectful 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.650
 at least this is true in the theater then 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.840
 but soon I'll read if 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 that does not fit into the race record 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.320
 Place one voucher I have so 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.100
 heavy is if I do not win brecht 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.200
 the quest and just makes new 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.400
 I already took last boss macher 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.290
 and his kÃ¶bler 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.370
 I think it's nice that they are the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.740
 history of world of warcraft 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.340
 evolve because at first it was like this 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.470
 that the charles cathedral as well as the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.220
 headquarter of scarlet above crusade it 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.750
 so everything was against the electrodes 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.690
 running so everything is hostage and 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.460
 later also everything human and now 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.200
 he stands today says the shell 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.770
 Crusade has failed and they are all 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.900
 lost 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.300
 and we must all bear witness to this 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.740
 Destroying shame he said about the 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.540
 new players of today the sound of it 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.370
 nothing at all, so somehow 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.190
 At some point there was a sign yes 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:17.780
 shit there was clear you can kick that 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.470
 wants now my target is out there 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.480
 just kick 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.720
 of which can occur knave clear is the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.630
 then of course out there instead of kicking 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.760
 so and was interrupted 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.690
 the word deadly for him so tattered 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.630
 There's not much to say 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:41.360
 we wanted now back on so the ltt 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:48.880
 marry ab mal problems now comes now 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.880
 you make stupid things stupid with dementia 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.440
 that's how it is in here 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.400
 because here the shell should have 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.400
 the next clean 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:13.849
 fire volleys crime 0 million I was 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.849
 but no harm 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.039
 I can not shit , I can not 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:39.710
 namely dazzle the cars out 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:42.780
 but somebody thought I could mine 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.020
 anti stumbling but i can change 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:53.070

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:55.050
 the beans I'm too blind I was there 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.039
 not first but there I am too 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.009
 very much on the advice itself 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.820
 concentrate his format excuse 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.840
 that too was our first word 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.410
 wedding is still a little something 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:10.340
 realize 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:18.840
 Zack and I had to explain 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:20.220
 I had to explain 1 boss but that was 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.389
 boss only for those who do not have it now 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.830
 you have seen further from the flame 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.110
 from interrupting here and there times 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.820
 clean finished even with gammel brevity 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.960
 not that hard if times 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.430
 maybe you'll see 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.199
 A challenge mode will show you 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.169
 to show that so too can 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:38.849
 otherwise that was red halls and us 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.860
 then we never watch each other at the next one 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.860

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.860
 Hello
