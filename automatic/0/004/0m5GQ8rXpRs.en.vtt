00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.860 

now<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.730> think<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.090> still<00:00:09.389> whether<00:00:09.660> you're

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
now I think you still whether you're

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.600 
now I think you still whether you're
being<00:00:10.320> directive<00:00:10.800> or<00:00:10.920> not<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.070> think<00:00:11.280> you've

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
being directive or not I think you've

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.940 
being directive or not I think you've
still<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> good<00:00:12.540> step<00:00:12.840> 5<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.889> is

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
still got to do a good step 5 this is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.259 
still got to do a good step 5 this is
another<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.549> those<00:00:14.670> areas<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.030> touched

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
another one of those areas I touched

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.700 
another one of those areas I touched
about<00:00:15.420> earlier<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.230> difficulty<00:00:16.680> with

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
about earlier I have difficulty with

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.370 
about earlier I have difficulty with
because<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> small<00:00:17.910> step<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:19.170> not

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
because this is a small step it's not

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.260 
because this is a small step it's not
big<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.100> when<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.760> about<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.090> little

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
big but when you think about a little

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.540 
big but when you think about a little
bit<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.689> invest<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.949> planning

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
bit we invest so much in this planning

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.710 
bit we invest so much in this planning
effort<00:00:23.990> that<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.560> managers<00:00:26.180> fail<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.539> be

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
effort that a lot of managers fail to be

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.679 
effort that a lot of managers fail to be
as<00:00:27.930> rigorous<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.570> asking<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
as rigorous in asking the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.729 
as rigorous in asking the
representatives<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:32.369> they're<00:00:32.669> serious<00:00:33.739> if

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
representatives if they're serious if

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.520 
representatives if they're serious if
they'll<00:00:34.980> try<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.420> if<00:00:36.420> they're<00:00:36.690> committed<00:00:37.230> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
they'll try it if they're committed it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.170 
they'll try it if they're committed it
isn't<00:00:37.829> complicated<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.030> got

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
isn't complicated I think you just got

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.200 
isn't complicated I think you just got
to<00:00:39.300> look<00:00:39.450> him<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> eyes<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.500> say<00:00:41.309> maybe

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to look him in the eyes and say maybe

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
to look him in the eyes and say maybe
you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.660> easy<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.230> first<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.920> start

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you can go easy at first you can start

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.119 
you can go easy at first you can start
with<00:00:44.250> fun<00:00:44.460> later<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.129> now

what we already know in the field force
and<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.400> damn<00:01:32.610> clothes<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> I

way<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> low<00:01:38.280> rigorous<00:01:38.700> don't

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
way we have to be a low rigorous don't

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.510 
way we have to be a low rigorous don't
have<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.509> doesn't<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> lot<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.079> time

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
have this doesn't take a lot of time

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.730 
have this doesn't take a lot of time
just<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
just what do you think can you do it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
I've asked that question many many times

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
I've asked that question many many times
of<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.299> own<00:01:48.420> organizations<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.649> funny

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of my own organizations and it's funny

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
of my own organizations and it's funny
sometimes<00:01:50.610> how<00:01:50.970> hard<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> clear

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
sometimes how hard it is to get a clear

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740 
sometimes how hard it is to get a clear
answer<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.740> those<00:01:52.860> three<00:01:53.159> questions<00:01:53.700> hard<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
answer to those three questions hard to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
answer to those three questions hard to
get<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> clear<00:01:55.229> answer<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.340> stick<00:01:56.490> with

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
get a clear answer so I just stick with

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.060 
get a clear answer so I just stick with
it<00:01:57.020> crystallize<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.290> commitment<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> little

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it crystallize that commitment a little

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
it crystallize that commitment a little
bit
