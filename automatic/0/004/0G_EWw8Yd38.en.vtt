can<00:01:29.189> walk<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.820> their<00:01:30.210> new<00:01:30.390> offense

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
can walk in there with their new offense

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.630 
can walk in there with their new offense
and<00:01:30.990> their<00:01:31.110> running<00:01:31.409> game<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> 24<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and their running game and take a 24 to

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.190 
earmarking this game as the Ravens lead
into<00:04:04.000> will<00:04:04.150> likely<00:04:04.450> be<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> playoff<00:04:05.170> berth

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200

between both of these teams Baltimore

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.630 
between both of these teams Baltimore
has<00:04:07.840> plenty<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.260> opportunity<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:08.950> reason<00:04:09.519> to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
has plenty of opportunity and reason to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.550 
has plenty of opportunity and reason to
be<00:04:09.730> confident<00:04:10.180> going<00:04:10.330> into<00:04:10.540> this<00:04:10.720> game<00:04:10.810> but<00:04:11.500> I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
be confident going into this game but I

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.650 
be confident going into this game but I
see<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.890> Steelers<00:04:12.190> pulling<00:04:12.730> this<00:04:12.850> one<00:04:12.910> off<00:04:13.150> 16

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
see the Steelers pulling this one off 16

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.630 
see the Steelers pulling this one off 16
to<00:04:13.780> 13<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.230> moving<00:04:14.650> ahead<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.920> nine<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.430> three

to 13 and moving ahead to nine and three

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.460 
to 13 and moving ahead to nine and three
on<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.910> season<00:04:16.269> those<00:04:16.630> are<00:04:16.810> our<00:04:16.930> three<00:04:17.139> games

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
on the season those are our three games

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.469 
on the season those are our three games
three<00:04:17.890> real<00:04:18.190> tough<00:04:18.519> road<00:04:18.910> games<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.419> the

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
three real tough road games for the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.330 
three real tough road games for the
Steelers<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.959> 2012<00:04:20.530> we're<00:04:20.890> reasonably

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
Steelers in 2012 we're reasonably

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.650 
Steelers in 2012 we're reasonably
confident<00:04:21.789> they<00:04:21.940> could<00:04:22.000> win<00:04:22.210> all<00:04:22.330> three<00:04:22.539> of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
confident they could win all three of

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.150 
confident they could win all three of
them<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.990> could<00:04:23.200> see<00:04:23.350> reasons<00:04:23.710> why<00:04:23.830> they<00:04:23.979> lose

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
them I could see reasons why they lose

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.529 
them I could see reasons why they lose
all<00:04:24.370> three<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.640> them<00:04:24.789> but<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:24.940> guess<00:04:25.150> that's<00:04:25.390> why

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
all three of them but I guess that's why

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.450 
all three of them but I guess that's why
they<00:04:25.690> play<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.900> game<00:04:26.050> either<00:04:26.770> way<00:04:27.010> I'm<00:04:27.250> Neal

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
they play the game either way I'm Neal

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.650 
they play the game either way I'm Neal
