and for the jacket for this outfit I am

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.360

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
but I thought this jacket worked really

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.570 
but I thought this jacket worked really
well<00:02:28.870> because<00:02:29.319> it's<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.680> darker<00:02:30.040> grade<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
well because it's a darker grade in the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.280 
well because it's a darker grade in the
sweater<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.150> there's<00:02:31.360> still<00:02:31.540> some<00:02:31.600> contrast

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
sweater so there's still some contrast

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.840 
sweater so there's still some contrast
there<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.040> really<00:02:33.280> love<00:02:33.549> with<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
there and I really love with the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.570
