00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
surface area for heating just it's just

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.670 
surface area for heating just it's just
much<00:01:08.280> more<00:01:08.310> efficient<00:01:08.910> that<00:01:09.060> way<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> I'll

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
much more efficient that way and I'll

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.060 
much more efficient that way and I'll
get<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> video<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.830> as<00:01:13.830> soon<00:01:13.979> as

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
get a video up on the on that as soon as

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.719 
get a video up on the on that as soon as
I<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.399> built<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:16.310> every<00:01:17.310> year<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.520> take

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I get it built but every year I take

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
I get it built but every year I take
this<00:01:17.850> thing<00:01:18.030> apart<00:01:18.149> any<00:01:18.509> Wes<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.810> second<00:01:19.170> year

through it and and it's it's been

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
through it and and it's it's been
fabulous<00:01:25.670> heats<00:01:26.670> my<00:01:26.850> workshop<00:01:27.300> great<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.880> if

fabulous heats my workshop great and if

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.380 
fabulous heats my workshop great and if
I<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> ceiling<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
I get a ceiling in there with this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
I get a ceiling in there with this
double-barreled<00:01:33.390> kit<00:01:35.090> should<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:37.470> should

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
double-barreled kit should be it should

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.039 
double-barreled kit should be it should
be<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.439> Bahamas<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.159> winter

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
be like the Bahamas in there this winter

be like the Bahamas in there this winter
so<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.770> anyway<00:01:44.540> two<00:01:45.540> years<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> use<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so but anyway two years of use out of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.789 
so but anyway two years of use out of
this<00:01:46.770> barrel<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.260> wouldn't<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this barrel and and it wouldn't I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.910 
this barrel and and it wouldn't I
wouldn't<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.640> afraid<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:52.080> bit<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
wouldn't be afraid not one little bit to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
wouldn't be afraid not one little bit to
use<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.280> thing<00:01:53.460> another<00:01:53.759> couple<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.360> three

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
use this thing another couple of three

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
use this thing another couple of three
years<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.080> they're<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.470> virtually<00:01:56.369> no

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
years because they're just virtually no

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
years because they're just virtually no
damage<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:58.020> inside<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.530> it<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:01.409> course<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
damage to the inside of it of course I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.940 
damage to the inside of it of course I
did<00:02:01.950> take<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.490> paint<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.950> heat

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
did take and paint it with the heat

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
did take and paint it with the heat
paint<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:06.090> 1200<00:02:06.720> degree<00:02:08.329> heat<00:02:09.329> resistant

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
paint the 1200 degree heat resistant

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.000 
paint the 1200 degree heat resistant
paint<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.880> but<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.360> mean<00:02:12.920> there's<00:02:13.920> just

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
paint but but really I mean there's just

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.940 
paint but but really I mean there's just
there's<00:02:14.910> no<00:02:15.150> rust<00:02:15.480> no<00:02:15.720> damage<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.440> mean<00:02:16.829> you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
there's no rust no damage I mean you

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
there's no rust no damage I mean you
know<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.160> had<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.519> get<00:02:17.730> wet<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> have

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
know it had to get wet for it to have

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.100 
know it had to get wet for it to have
rust<00:02:19.049> in<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.600> think<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
rust in it but I think one of the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.370 
rust in it but I think one of the
biggest<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.620> about<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.870> fire

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
biggest things about this is the fire

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.140 
biggest things about this is the fire
brick<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.920> sand<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.730> put<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
brick and sand that you put in the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.330 
brick and sand that you put in the
bottom<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.829> had<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.100> fire

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
bottom I think if you had that fire

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
bottom I think if you had that fire
sitting<00:02:29.700> directly<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.750> bottom<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
sitting directly on the bottom of the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
sitting directly on the bottom of the
drum<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.100> results<00:02:32.519> might<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.880> completely

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
drum the results might be completely

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
drum the results might be completely
different<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.910> it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
different but but it's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.619 
different but but it's
he's<00:02:36.879> got<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> layer<00:02:38.099> right<00:02:39.099> here<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.970> stacked

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
he's got a layer right here I I stacked

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.500 
he's got a layer right here I I stacked
the<00:02:40.840> heat<00:02:41.830> bricks<00:02:42.129> up<00:02:42.400> all<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.120> way<00:02:43.209> around

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
the heat bricks up all the way around

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.470 
the heat bricks up all the way around
this<00:02:43.720> whole<00:02:44.019> area<00:02:44.349> right<00:02:45.099> here<00:02:45.209> would<00:02:46.209> be<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
this whole area right here would be the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000 
this whole area right here would be the
bottom<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> stove<00:02:47.140> that's<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.560> holes<00:02:47.739> for

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
bottom of the stove that's the holes for

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.350 
bottom of the stove that's the holes for
the<00:02:48.069> for<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.790> feet<00:02:49.000> right<00:02:49.300> there<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.620> uh<00:02:50.650> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
the for the feet right there but uh I
