all<00:00:04.630> right<00:00:04.720> this<00:00:04.900> is<00:00:05.020> a<00:00:05.049> little<00:00:05.230> supplement<00:00:05.859> to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:05.980 
all right this is a little supplement to

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.910 
all right this is a little supplement to
the<00:00:06.100> standing<00:00:06.490> wave<00:00:07.109> demonstration<00:00:08.109> that<00:00:08.889> I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
the standing wave demonstration that I

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.830 
the standing wave demonstration that I
did<00:00:09.129> a<00:00:09.160> little<00:00:09.280> bit<00:00:09.520> earlier<00:00:09.850> right<00:00:10.450> now<00:00:10.629> my

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
did a little bit earlier right now my

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.250 
did a little bit earlier right now my
function<00:00:11.080> generator<00:00:11.469> is<00:00:12.309> producing<00:00:12.490> a<00:00:13.299> 33

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
function generator is producing a 33

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.250 
function generator is producing a 33
Hertz<00:00:14.500> wave<00:00:14.799> roughly<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.810> length<00:00:17.050> and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
Hertz wave roughly and the length and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.170 
Hertz wave roughly and the length and
tension<00:00:17.650> are<00:00:17.770> such<00:00:17.980> that<00:00:18.190> we<00:00:18.250> have<00:00:18.430> a<00:00:18.699> standing

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
tension are such that we have a standing

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.450 
tension are such that we have a standing
wave<00:00:19.330> with<00:00:19.600> two<00:00:20.050> nodes<00:00:20.289> between<00:00:20.589> the<00:00:20.890> ends<00:00:21.279> and

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
wave with two nodes between the ends and

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.019 
wave with two nodes between the ends and
three<00:00:22.119> anti<00:00:22.480> nodes<00:00:22.720> now<00:00:23.710> it's<00:00:24.029> particularly

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
three anti nodes now it's particularly

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.359 
three anti nodes now it's particularly
amusing<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.810> shine<00:00:26.169> a<00:00:26.199> strobe<00:00:26.859> light<00:00:26.890> on<00:00:27.220> it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
amusing to shine a strobe light on it

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.859 
amusing to shine a strobe light on it
especially<00:00:27.669> one<00:00:28.060> where<00:00:28.179> you<00:00:28.269> can<00:00:28.419> control<00:00:28.749> the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
especially one where you can control the

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.569 
especially one where you can control the
frequency<00:00:29.079> because<00:00:30.039> then<00:00:30.159> you<00:00:30.279> get<00:00:30.400> some

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
frequency because then you get some

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.850 
frequency because then you get some
interesting<00:00:30.789> visual<00:00:31.329> effects<00:00:31.659> we<00:00:32.439> turn<00:00:32.680> that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
interesting visual effects we turn that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.070 
interesting visual effects we turn that
on<00:00:32.920> right<00:00:33.130> now<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:36.550> now<00:00:36.580> my<00:00:37.480> strobe<00:00:37.840> light

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
on right now right now my strobe light

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.770 
on right now right now my strobe light
is<00:00:38.110> set<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.590> frequency<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.510> 36<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.630> a<00:00:40.750> half

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
is set to a frequency of 36 and a half

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.820 
is set to a frequency of 36 and a half
purse<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.970> string<00:00:43.330> is<00:00:43.600> moving<00:00:44.470> up<00:00:44.650> and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
purse so the string is moving up and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.850 
purse so the string is moving up and
down<00:00:45.450> 33<00:00:46.450> times<00:00:46.900> every<00:00:47.290> second

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
down 33 times every second

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.240 
down 33 times every second
but<00:00:48.250> I'm<00:00:48.460> flashing<00:00:49.330> my<00:00:50.290> strobe<00:00:50.530> light<00:00:50.740> on<00:00:50.770> it

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
but I'm flashing my strobe light on it

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.410 
but I'm flashing my strobe light on it
36<00:00:52.000> times<00:00:52.240> every<00:00:52.720> second<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.250> right<00:00:55.000> now<00:00:55.180> it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
36 times every second so right now it

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.120 
36 times every second so right now it
should<00:00:55.660> look<00:00:55.780> like<00:00:55.840> this<00:00:56.230> ghost<00:00:56.530> image<00:00:56.890> is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
should look like this ghost image is

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.490 
should look like this ghost image is
moving<00:00:57.490> up<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.850> down<00:00:57.970> approximately<00:00:58.690> three

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
moving up and down approximately three

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.400 
moving up and down approximately three
and<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.710> half<00:00:59.890> times<00:01:00.220> every<00:01:01.180> second<00:01:01.630> I<00:01:01.750> can<00:01:01.960> slow

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
and a half times every second I can slow

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.429 
and a half times every second I can slow
that<00:01:02.560> down<00:01:02.800> by<00:01:03.460> reducing<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:05.049> speed<00:01:05.409> on

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
that down by reducing the the speed on

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.580 
that down by reducing the the speed on
the<00:01:05.650> strobe<00:01:05.979> light<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.810> right<00:01:08.200> now<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:11.439> now

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
the strobe light so right now right now

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.980 
the strobe light so right now right now
it's<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.829> about<00:01:11.890> 35<00:01:12.729> Hertz<00:01:13.179> compared<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.869> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
it's at about 35 Hertz compared to the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.529 
it's at about 35 Hertz compared to the
33<00:01:14.499> Hertz<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.039> string<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:16.210> looks<00:01:16.390> like

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
33 Hertz of the string and it looks like

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.080 
33 Hertz of the string and it looks like
this<00:01:16.719> extra<00:01:17.109> bright<00:01:17.380> image<00:01:17.829> is<00:01:18.130> moving<00:01:18.789> up<00:01:18.969> and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
this extra bright image is moving up and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.319 
this extra bright image is moving up and
down

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
down

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.020 
down
roughly<00:01:20.020> twice<00:01:20.319> every<00:01:20.710> second<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.340> can<00:01:21.789> slow

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
roughly twice every second I can slow

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.230 
roughly twice every second I can slow
this<00:01:22.179> down<00:01:22.240> even<00:01:22.719> further

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this down even further

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.760 
this down even further
right<00:01:25.240> now<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.509> strobe<00:01:25.960> light<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.229> set<00:01:26.560> to

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
right now the strobe light is set to

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.370 
right now the strobe light is set to
approximately<00:01:27.729> 34<00:01:28.359> Hertz<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:29.999> the<00:01:31.380> bright

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
approximately 34 Hertz and the bright

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.559 
approximately 34 Hertz and the bright
image<00:01:32.799> that's<00:01:33.639> kind<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.880> like<00:01:33.999> a<00:01:34.060> ghost<00:01:34.329> image

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
image that's kind of like a ghost image

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.679 
image that's kind of like a ghost image
moving<00:01:35.469> up<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:35.920> down<00:01:36.009> around<00:01:36.759> one<00:01:37.119> time<00:01:37.420> every

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
moving up and down around one time every

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.239 
moving up and down around one time every
second<00:01:38.079> by<00:01:38.649> shining<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.219> here<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.799> see<00:01:41.979> a

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
second by shining it here you can see a

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.489 
second by shining it here you can see a
kind<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.939> slow<00:01:43.210> motion<00:01:43.420> version<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.139> what<00:01:44.319> this

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
kind of slow motion version of what this

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.590 
kind of slow motion version of what this
string<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:44.950> really<00:01:45.100> doing<00:01:45.639> it's<00:01:46.090> moving<00:01:46.420> up

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
string is really doing it's moving up

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.260 
string is really doing it's moving up
and<00:01:46.749> down<00:01:46.869> 33<00:01:47.619> times<00:01:47.859> every<00:01:48.219> second<00:01:48.609> but<00:01:48.759> you

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
and down 33 times every second but you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.550 
and down 33 times every second but you
shine<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.509> strobe<00:01:49.840> light<00:01:50.049> on<00:01:50.079> it<00:01:50.319> of<00:01:50.439> this

if you touch it though you can clearly

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.620 
if you touch it though you can clearly
feel<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.530> string<00:02:03.950> hitting<00:02:04.250> your<00:02:04.340> finger<00:02:04.760> 33

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.810 
feel the string hitting your finger 33
times<00:02:05.810> every<00:02:06.230> second<00:02:06.620> it's<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:07.010> bit<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.730> an

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
times every second it's a bit of an

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.110 
times every second it's a bit of an
optical<00:02:08.119> illusion<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.850> an<00:02:11.000> example

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
optical illusion here this is an example

optical illusion here this is an example
of<00:02:12.520> phenomenon<00:02:13.520> called<00:02:13.820> aliasing<00:02:14.600> which<00:02:14.720> is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840

also relevant to people in audio if you

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.880 
also relevant to people in audio if you

treat this strobe light as something

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.820 
treat this strobe light as something
that's<00:02:22.010> sampling<00:02:22.640> or<00:02:23.050> creating<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.200> digital

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
that's sampling or creating a digital

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
strobe light frequency closer to 33 you

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.900 
strobe light frequency closer to 33 you
can<00:02:48.470> find<00:02:48.740> this<00:02:48.890> should<00:02:49.070> be<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> sweet<00:02:49.550> spot<00:02:49.880> I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
can find this should be a sweet spot I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.600 
can find this should be a sweet spot I
can<00:02:50.060> hit<00:02:50.390> where<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.560> bright<00:02:51.800> image<00:02:52.130> appears

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
can hit where the bright image appears

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.300 
can hit where the bright image appears
to<00:02:52.850> freeze<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.800> roughly<00:02:55.070> right

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
to freeze there it is roughly right

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.520 
to freeze there it is roughly right
there<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:56.180> course<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.510> string<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.320> see

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
there of course the string you can see

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.080 
there of course the string you can see
is<00:02:57.620> not<00:02:57.800> frozen<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.490> moving<00:02:58.760> up<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.000> down

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
is not frozen it's moving up and down

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.440 
is not frozen it's moving up and down
would<00:02:59.420> be<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.690> images<00:03:00.230> if<00:03:00.590> my<00:03:01.430> strobe<00:03:02.209> light

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
would be the images if my strobe light

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.320 
would be the images if my strobe light
is<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.959> shining<00:03:03.890> at<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.070> frequency<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.580> 33<00:03:05.090> Hertz

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
is is shining at a frequency of 33 Hertz

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.140 
is is shining at a frequency of 33 Hertz
that<00:03:05.600> means<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.739> is<00:03:06.890> producing<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.700> flash<00:03:07.970> of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that means it is producing a flash of

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.240 
that means it is producing a flash of
light<00:03:08.390> every<00:03:09.050> time<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.470> string<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:09.890> say<00:03:10.070> at

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
light every time the string is say at

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.100 
light every time the string is say at
the<00:03:10.370> top<00:03:10.580> or<00:03:10.850> at<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.060> bottom<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.660> way<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
the top or at the bottom this way it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.410 
the top or at the bottom this way it
appears<00:03:12.440> frozen<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.760> make<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.000> move<00:03:14.120> again

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
appears frozen I can make it move again

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.150 
appears frozen I can make it move again
in<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.630> other<00:03:14.720> direction<00:03:15.110> by<00:03:15.560> making<00:03:16.070> the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
in the other direction by making the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.040 
in the other direction by making the
frequency<00:03:16.670> 32<00:03:17.270> Hertz<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.070> here's<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.280> image

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.740 

so<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.830> haven't<00:03:25.100> changed<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.670> string<00:03:26.030> or<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
so I haven't changed the string or the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.560 
so I haven't changed the string or the
signal<00:03:27.080> generator<00:03:27.730> all<00:03:28.730> I've<00:03:28.970> been<00:03:29.000> affecting

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
signal generator all I've been affecting

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.690 
signal generator all I've been affecting
is<00:03:29.720> what<00:03:30.080> happens<00:03:30.470> with<00:03:30.710> this<00:03:30.860> brighter<00:03:31.250> image

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
is what happens with this brighter image

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.550 
is what happens with this brighter image
as<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.240> change<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.630> frequency<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.290> strobe

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
as I change the frequency of the strobe

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.920 
as I change the frequency of the strobe
light<00:03:33.760> looks<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.030> good<00:03:35.180> up<00:03:35.330> close<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.870> in

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
light looks really good up close and in

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.280 
light looks really good up close and in
the<00:03:36.110> dark<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:38.120> even<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.570> can<00:03:38.720> shine<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.140> on

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
the dark and even you can shine it on

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.400 
the dark and even you can shine it on
the<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.790> shine<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.510> vibrating

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
the you can shine it on the vibrating

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.530 
the you can shine it on the vibrating
machine<00:03:42.590> as<00:03:42.920> well<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.310> looks<00:03:43.370> like<00:03:43.610> this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
machine as well and it looks like this

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.080 
machine as well and it looks like this
end<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:44.990> it<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.380> moving<00:03:46.280> up<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.550> down<00:03:46.670> only

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
end of it is moving up and down only

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.700 
end of it is moving up and down only
once<00:03:47.330> every<00:03:47.540> second<00:03:48.110> even<00:03:48.380> though<00:03:48.530> it's

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
once every second even though it's

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.620 
once every second even though it's
currently<00:03:49.070> being<00:03:49.160> instructed<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.880> move<00:03:50.000> 33

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
currently being instructed to move 33

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.330 
currently being instructed to move 33
times<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:51.020> fast

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.390 

so<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.239> like<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.630> image<00:03:57.840> because<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.830> it's

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
so I like this image because it's a it's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.550 
so I like this image because it's a it's
a<00:03:59.459> good<00:03:59.610> way<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.760> seeing<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.180> slow<00:04:00.450> motion<00:04:00.959> what

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
a good way of seeing in slow motion what

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.260 
a good way of seeing in slow motion what
this<00:04:01.739> string<00:04:02.069> is<00:04:02.220> really<00:04:02.340> doing<00:04:02.790> many<00:04:03.060> many

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
this string is really doing many many

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.290 
this string is really doing many many
times<00:04:03.599> every<00:04:03.810> second
