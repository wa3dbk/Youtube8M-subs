alongside<00:03:10.960> its<00:03:11.960> it<00:03:12.319> definitely<00:03:12.709> makes<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.950> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
alongside its it definitely makes it a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.970 
alongside its it definitely makes it a
lot<00:03:13.130> easier<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.670> fact<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.450> know<00:03:14.480> I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.010 
might think he's doing something wrong
anymore<00:03:17.120> think<00:03:17.390> I'm<00:03:17.480> doing<00:03:17.600> something<00:03:17.870> wrong

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
anymore think I'm doing something wrong

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.059 
anymore think I'm doing something wrong

and you know we have a little blood but

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.730 
and you know we have a little blood but
like<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.459> said<00:03:19.640> yeah<00:03:20.209> we<00:03:20.630> we<00:03:21.230> were<00:03:21.350> able<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
like you said yeah we we were able to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.020 
like you said yeah we we were able to
tell<00:03:21.920> each<00:03:22.040> other<00:03:22.160> things<00:03:22.430> without<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.790> know
