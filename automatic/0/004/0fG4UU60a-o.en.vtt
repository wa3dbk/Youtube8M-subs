00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.490
 jo people when I am again with a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 new update video this time with something 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.719
 So here you see that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.230
 underground yes the train is then later 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 So cover as he undercut the base 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 is there a crane still here yes 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.289
 nothing is not much I have sometimes 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.359
 I did a little test what I like like that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.859
 structural engineering so here at this point 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.990
 I would make that farmer again 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.830
 again because it comes at this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.420
 put the base unit say a Jew 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 Battlefield will not be that big 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.670
 base with then say that will be so 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.489
 I bet fence 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.520
 two buildings so double building with 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.989
 windows all kinds of bells and whistles 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 these buildings would not be special 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.059
 already easily says so from here 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.300
 from 4 to so and then they will be easy 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.489
 hoya its probably one way or the other 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.370
 no idea and these would be through 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.670
 a bridge with a catching up 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.140
 Do you want to fight the battle? 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 a front here, I'm going to play 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.890
 then he was still all sorts of things 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 then do it with a trauschein 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.250
 I do not even show because I have 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 just at times not so much now 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.470
 already dark and I have no light where 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.680
 this is this lamp and manufacturer 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.500
 somewhere else so I'll be happy too 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 Braunstein here are all possible 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.490
 Things make a little mountain or 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 little mountains just makes me something 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.880
 a strange environment and so base fits 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 So I do not know where play too 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.490
 because of planet I'm always like that 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 planet I part me is not rigid 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.380
 has and certainly to go a few 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.079
 end and stuff but I do not know where 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.509
 that once it should be me but that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.509
 market such an unknown desert planet 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 i also have no blog all too well 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.710
 make so I'm more of the type which only 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.369
 times 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 this large area of ​​rise the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.940
 danger kassen to converted and then 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.209
 just not so much i never dp like that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.819
 from whole things of built the halt of 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.910
 lots of greenery from boyen plants 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.660
 cure 10, he was so dry 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.940
 areas or ice but yes I'm here 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 I just can not find it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.000
 some I speak not find it 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.890
 I think I should finally have to 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.709
 too little about crested wolfs when i did 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.260
 say anyway and not the normal star 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.209
 wars he shared yes I know them all 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.370
 but I am not anymore because I think so 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.700
 she just does not hit Anna so paquin 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:48.720
