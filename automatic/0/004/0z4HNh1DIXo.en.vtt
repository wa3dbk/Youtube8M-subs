i could just be the way that sharpen the
sword<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:35.820> sorts<00:00:36.210> means<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.570> do

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
sword but there's sorts means that do

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
sword but there's sorts means that do
cut<00:00:37.050> elements<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.160> take<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> look<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> few

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
cut elements so let's take a look a few

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
cut elements so let's take a look a few
maybe<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.610> cut

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
maybe we can get some that can cut

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
maybe we can get some that can cut
electricity<00:00:42.210> i<00:00:42.719> think<00:00:43.020> would<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> cool<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
electricity i think would be cool we

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
electricity i think would be cool we
already<00:00:44.040> saw<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> guy<00:00:44.760> sorrow<00:00:45.539> will

already saw that guy sorrow will
electricity<00:00:46.440> i<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.829> they'll<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.100> really

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
electricity i think they'll be really

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.029

cool<00:00:47.610> seeing<00:00:48.329> sorrow<00:00:48.629> being<00:00:48.960> able<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.469> an

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
cool seeing sorrow being able to use an

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
cool seeing sorrow being able to use an
element<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:52.079> widen<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
element kind of like what widen the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.770 
element kind of like what widen the
range<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.239> enemies<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> he

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
range of you know more enemies that he

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
range of you know more enemies that he
can<00:00:54.930> fight<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.340> being<00:00:56.489> used<00:00:56.610> for

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
can fight I can see it being used for

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
can fight I can see it being used for
like<00:00:57.210> many<00:00:57.420> medical<00:00:57.780> reasons<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.350> law<00:00:58.739> maybe

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
like many medical reasons like law maybe

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
like many medical reasons like law maybe
you'll<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.969> able<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> numb<00:01:00.539> somebody<00:01:00.960> by

like that I like the idea I like the
idea<00:01:04.680> maybe<00:01:05.580> irv<00:01:05.909> could<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.330> another<00:01:06.540> element

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
idea maybe irv could be another element

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
idea maybe irv could be another element
that<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> future<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.450> know

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
logia but something like that I sounds
weird<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> say<00:01:25.080> logia<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.610> it's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
weird when you say logia but it's it's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.160 
weird when you say logia but it's it's
kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> hard<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.540> seven<00:01:27.869> talking<00:01:27.990> about

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
fire at one point and fire seems to be a
very<00:01:43.290> frequent<00:01:43.890> theme<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.579> comes<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> one

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
very frequent theme when it comes to one

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
very frequent theme when it comes to one
piece<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.390> mean<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> only<00:01:46.350> power<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
piece I mean that's the only power that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
piece I mean that's the only power that
ohta<00:01:47.189> loves<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.880> rehash<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.570> mean<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.840> have

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
ohta loves to rehash I mean we have

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.679 
ohta loves to rehash I mean we have
tsavo<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.439> ace<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:53.040> had<00:01:53.689> Marco

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
tsavo we have you know ace we had Marco

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.469 
tsavo we have you know ace we had Marco
we<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.530> Keenum<00:01:56.280> oh<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> other<00:01:56.880> guy<00:01:57.149> has

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
we have Keenum oh and the other guy has

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
we have Keenum oh and the other guy has
Sora<00:01:57.750> had<00:01:58.469> fire<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.979> sword<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.640> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
Sora had fire and sword so we know that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.789 
Sora had fire and sword so we know that
fires<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.630> constant<00:02:00.960> theme<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.740> we

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
fires a constant theme so I think we

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.039 
fires a constant theme so I think we
couldn't<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.159> more<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.630> maybe<00:02:03.630> wind

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
couldn't see more of that maybe wind

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.410 
couldn't see more of that maybe wind
will<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.740> cool<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> mean<00:02:05.369> solar<00:02:06.060> already

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
will be cool one I mean solar already

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300 
will be cool one I mean solar already
does<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.780> dragon<00:02:07.110> twister<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.710> think<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
does that dragon twister I think that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.309 
does that dragon twister I think that
was<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:09.060> cool

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
was a really cool

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.599 
was a really cool
move<00:02:09.439> I<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.069> idea<00:02:10.159> of<00:02:10.429> him<00:02:11.140> using<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.799> move

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609 
move I like the idea of him using a move

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.539 
move I like the idea of him using a move
that<00:02:13.909> allows<00:02:14.120> him<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.769> hit<00:02:15.769> even<00:02:15.920> bigger

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
that allows him to hit even bigger

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.729 
that allows him to hit even bigger
opponents<00:02:17.359> like<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.659> big<00:02:17.930> range<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.349> enemies

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
opponents like a big range of enemies

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.530 
opponents like a big range of enemies
maybe<00:02:19.400> he<00:02:19.579> can<00:02:19.700> go<00:02:19.790> against<00:02:19.999> like<00:02:20.180> whole

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
maybe he can go against like whole

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.399 
maybe he can go against like whole
armies<00:02:22.359> water<00:02:23.359> will<00:02:23.629> be<00:02:23.719> pretty<00:02:23.959> cool<00:02:24.139> just

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
armies water will be pretty cool just

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.920 
armies water will be pretty cool just
because<00:02:24.439> there's<00:02:24.829> so<00:02:24.980> many<00:02:25.719> what's<00:02:26.719> a<00:02:26.780> call

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
because there's so many what's a call

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.470 
because there's so many what's a call
there's<00:02:27.139> so<00:02:27.290> many<00:02:27.379> different<00:02:27.889> uses<00:02:28.609> so<00:02:29.209> water

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
there's so many different uses so water

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.619 
there's so many different uses so water
would<00:02:29.659> be<00:02:29.750> pretty<00:02:30.019> cool<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.230> use<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.620> say<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.939> an

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
would be pretty cool to use I say as an

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.569 
would be pretty cool to use I say as an
element<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.019> cut<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.439> of<00:02:33.739> course<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.069> have<00:02:34.219> ice

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
element to cut and of course we have ice

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.080 
element to cut and of course we have ice
which<00:02:35.060> Brooke<00:02:35.659> used<00:02:35.989> which<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:37.280> software<00:02:38.000> it's

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
which Brooke used which I software it's

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.940 
which Brooke used which I software it's
pretty<00:02:38.299> cool<00:02:38.419> but<00:02:38.599> we<00:02:38.749> only<00:02:38.870> seen<00:02:39.650> him<00:02:39.739> use<00:02:39.919> it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
pretty cool but we only seen him use it

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.729 
pretty cool but we only seen him use it
twice<00:02:40.219> now<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.579> believe<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:42.709> I

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
twice now I believe so that's what I

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.509 
twice now I believe so that's what I
have<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.370> now<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.659> said<00:02:44.719> just<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.200> short

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
have for now like I said just a short

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.860 
have for now like I said just a short
discussion<00:02:46.519> it's<00:02:47.030> not<00:02:47.180> much<00:02:47.329> of<00:02:47.359> a<00:02:47.510> theories

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
discussion it's not much of a theories

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.189 
discussion it's not much of a theories
more<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.109> discussion<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:49.219> I<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.579> feel<00:02:49.819> that

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.199 
more a discussion but I really feel that

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.449 
more a discussion but I really feel that
we're<00:02:51.199> going<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.349> see<00:02:51.530> more<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.799> these<00:02:52.010> element
