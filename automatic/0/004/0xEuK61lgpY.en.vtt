00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 on the coast now I bring you a video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 pretty short but that many of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.919
 you asked me and it's about the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.590
 shadows that buy 30 shores falling 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.009
 and those are the 4 the first color that is this 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.859
 that is vibrant is called deep grave that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.530
 it's a very vibrant purple the second 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.890
 color is called as gay 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.259
 I'm ready 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:32.279
 on average the next with the chair 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.379
 macri beats me and is a neutral coffee medium 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.980
 and the other color is called caramel which is 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.980
 a mustard color 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.309
 I want to show you a little how 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.309
 pigment these shadows and which ones to live 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.050
 the candy as you see has as a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 golden mean digit but if you look at 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.839
 he waits to be noticed in the pot and they have 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.850
 many falls the truth like that it 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.039
 they leave a little powder to do apply 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.810
 the pepper that way the pepper does not 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.930
 it's very even 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.280
 they actually look like these shadows if 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.150
 you want the typical palettes of 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.320
 88 colors of coasts is the same shadow 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.310
 you can see that the pot is bigger and 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.570
 you can choose the colors 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.570
 the next one is the ace gray 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.229
 it descends is not eternal 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.300
 nice because it's never to be plated 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.710
 is that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.780
 the other color is the cream and beats that is 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.400
 the coffee that one has looks at it 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.800
 exquisite and the truth is that he threw 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.670
 any amount 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.680
 of chubby and has some golden glitters 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 that the truth is not transferred to 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 pepper, salt 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.820
 you only have one of brightness but not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.450
 they are the digits that you see in it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.450
 called in the deposit 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.930
 and the last one who believes is his 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.930
 membership 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.770
 but the problem is this 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.770
 even rice 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.940
 and you have to apply apply to apply 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.370
 apply so that it is even of this 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.409
 shape 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.890
 see that I make more notice that happens 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.890
 several times 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 So there are four colors the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.980
 truth is that point they are pretty 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.120
 Formosa are like those of the pallets 3 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.120
 I said that effectively 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.360
 the plicas with a brush comes out a lot 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.180
 of mixed powder and that is blowing the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.410
 every time they are pigmented there 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.630
 You can see the others as they were 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 and they are quite cheap and a dollar is worth 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.870
 with 99 each one is to say like a thousand pesos 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.180
 Chileans 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.000
 much cheaper than being in 10 thousand 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.190
 900 Chilean pesos each of which 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.930
 they come unusual and we have cheap that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.280
 those of make here since it is also a 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.780
 review that if you want to go see the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.620
 politics this look this look dealt with 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.410
 the shadow of mercadito and to whom 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.630
 recommended me 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.980
 if they want to spend a lot of money and 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.950
 need a palette they want 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 customize it with entertaining colors 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.240
 You will get the person to make up that is 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.250
 cheaper to 3000 pesos each pallets 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.320
 say 5 dollars with 99 take out the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.700
 individual sunshade and good to find 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.130
 psuv colors entertaining outside of what 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.840
 common as a color not 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.580
 find the make up kick and by color 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.680
 they want to have it there I'm going to make 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.030
 costs already prohibited I recommend that it be 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.890
 a palette of costs because they 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.370
 It is better to buy are about 88 colors 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.330
 that is worth 10 thousand pesos to buy 10 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.320
 of these is a life of 100 88 and if you 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.600
 I will say that this purchase is a 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.770
 Facebook 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.060
 by the way buy only four days for 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.130
 try it the same are colors that I do not 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.380
 had so obviously they serve me 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.470
 all this I know a surprised 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.250
 but I'm sure that in some of 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.890
 the palettes of the 88 colors or 42 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.710
 colors of having a similar color already like this 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.920
 what's that 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.150
 Well no, they are not my preferred, obviously 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.160
 can not keep using that I'm not going to 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.980
 vote either I will not try to mix 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.780
 other colors and cough but I'm made to 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.010
 choose me for price and average contame 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.260
 what here are that much better than there was 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.640
 that those of costing cels but there was matrix 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.150
 favorite is still the most because 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.800
 the pigmentation have no fall the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.410
 duration that lasts on the eyelid a lot 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.390
 while in the form of mixing in 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.250
 colors is much better besides 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.300
 obviously if they do not have as much money or not 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.860
 they want to invest so much talking 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.070
 only in some shadows because neither 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.420
 for how the idea and move your money away 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.850
 I absolutely recommend the thousand 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.580
 here I think they are like being native 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.260
 average and more reasonable already so that 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.180
 I hope you liked it below 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.180
