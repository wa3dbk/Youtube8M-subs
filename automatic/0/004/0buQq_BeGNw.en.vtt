00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.270
 water is the most common substance on earth 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.630
 she accompanies every moment of ours 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.380
 life but know no secret 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.640
 in itself is an amazing element from where 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.110
 it came 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.950
 who and why hit our planet with it 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.950
 the only one in the whole universe 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 perhaps answers to these questions knows 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.030
 only water itself 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 because today there are as many of her on earth 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.070
 how much was then when it all began 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 when the world was born I am accustomed to us 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.649
 outlines 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.649
 and sensations 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.580
 water is the basis of life on earth three 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.490
 quarters of living organisms are made up of 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.300
 water 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.140
 human body 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.440
 also consists of water in essence 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.930
 within us rivers flow pens and we 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.300
 are communicating vessels that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.340
 unite themselves a lot of fluid which 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.920
 is our body only in water 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.850
 Any 7 and any life begins 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.230
 embryo amniotic fluid are involved and in 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.940
 its development and in its preservation 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 it is the surrounding water like 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.700
 universal computer discloses 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.890
 any biological program but also 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.250
 in that case can only change 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.250
 water 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:48.660
 human embryo 4 weeks contains itself 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:52.330
 97 and 80 percent of and now 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.410
 a two-month baby contains 83 percent 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.050
 in the hotel the adult body 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.540
 contains 70 percent water from this we 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.540
 we can conclude that the aging process
