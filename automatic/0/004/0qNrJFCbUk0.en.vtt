00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.469
 hello good morning friends from area 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.150
 frontier viewers friends who are 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.310
 faithful to this spectacular program 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.050
 also with the days to betty vanessa today 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.240
 we have a special program today we have 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.099
 the talents detailing section and we have 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.349
 something special and it's decorative painting 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.029
 let's use the brush stroke sos all 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.680
 the brushstroke his all leaves 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.599
 spots but let's use the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.340
 following materials so that all 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.160
 take notes we are going to use paintings 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.350
 acrylics let's use brushes let's 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.930
 to use smooth bristle brushes that 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 they are fundamental for this brushstroke 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.050
 We are going to use different sizes of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.610
 hard bristle brushes 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.940
 we are going to use a delineating brush 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.770
 color palette and masking tape 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.930
 well we have the support where we are going to 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.000
 work the on canvas yes that is the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.220
 work support in this case I will 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.410
 use the earth tape simply 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.020
 as to perform a type of decoration 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.020
 let's just stick the tape 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.040
 generally when we work 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 this type of paintings we are going to look for 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 envelopes that protrude the elements 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 then I will work an acrylic 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.450
 black let's use a brush of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.190
 hard bristle and we're going to start applying 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.470
 when I'm going to use these elements 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.810
 I'm just going to apply with totally 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.110
 freedom on the surface 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.229
 we are going to simply apply 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.990
 horizontal stroke from left to right 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.970
 and from right to left so that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.840
 we simply got well covered 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.820
 the canvas layer so on I 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 I will continue to use some tones in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.630
 this case will work them all 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.179
 reds I'm going to play with some brown tones 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.310
 the combination and theory the color that you 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.530
 offers carving talents is fundamental 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.750
 for you to work in any 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 type of artwork is good to tell 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.229
 that at this moment parents 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.729
 young children who are watching us in 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.140
 this program 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.000
 If they want, they want to learn to paint 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.319
 come with the others have sitting 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 talent of the opportunity that you 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.819
 they were waiting for them to learn 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.739
 different painting techniques we are going to 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.290
 gift to people at this time 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.849
 communicated to the program if you 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.250
 We are going to give you the opportunity to give you the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.700
 50% discount we will give without 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.250
 half scholarships so they can 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.160
 communicate from now call now and can 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.799
 start working and learn this course 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.750
 of paint look let's now continue 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.680
 working repeated strokes but 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.980
 with a red color to go down the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.980
 tonalities 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.629
 after doing that today it is simply to 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.290
 review and I'm going to start applying a 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.290
 yellow background 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.879
 I'm just creating is an environment 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.879
 artistic 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.440
 I have the black case using the 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.820
 black is a color that allows us to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.820
 the other shades stand out 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.360
 so far I have an effect here 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.310
 I'm just going to use a brush and 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.460
 I'm going to do some effects as if it were 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.460
 Water 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.410
 and now I'm going to start the brushstrokes is 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.450
 I'm going to use a brush of bristles 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.150
 soft is important so we can 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.800
 work that and I'm going to just pull out 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.890
 from a red spot I'm going to make here 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.170
 simple to take out a stain we are going to 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 make a simple flower but 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.430
 we are simply going to create it from 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.040
 a stain I will create another type here 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.990
 of stain I am simply allowing 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.330
 that the colors of the background generate me 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.150
 other other shades 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.110
 I'm going to use another effect here 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.730
 it is simply a painting effect 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.730
 decorative 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.299
 let's simply generate an effect of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.970
 white with red 50 in colors 50% on 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.950
 another color this type of brushstrokes is 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.760
 works on the already wet surface 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.730
 so I'm just going to draw a few 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.540
 small strokes to give light on the outside 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.540
 of the surface 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.860
 I can grab all the yellows 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.570
 again and give him some brushstrokes 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.730
 those tones that allow us to give 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.230
 some colors over light 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.030
 here so far I'm doing the 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.440
 first detail now let's continue with 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.730
 this stain that you think will be this 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.220
 stain this stain let's take out 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.360
 we are just going to give it a touch of 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.890
 light very fast and let's give it an effect 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.150
 seeing movements now we're going to 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.100
 use a little bit of color 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.460
 fluorescent and let's start to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.270
 fill leds with some movements 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.990
 repeated we're just going to take a 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.210
 you already saw it is a butterfly totally 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.820
 that is coming out of the bottom and we're going to 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.590
 generate some spots 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.900
 with a white color to give it a 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.250
 little bit more light now to see having 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.760
 done this uses a brush more 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.610
 delgadito to review again for the 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.590
 white color that is light color the 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.500
 maximum expression of light and let's 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.849
 simply to give a few more tonalities 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.789
 of life 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.399
 and let's give it because this movement 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.009
 artistic as if the butterfly were 

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.749
 moving 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.249
 here you would say it was this 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:25.610
 stain I will simply use 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:28.300
 yellow and I'm going to create some effects of 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.300
 movement 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.270
 for another tonality that highlights the background 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.270
 simply 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.949
 I will use the pineapple the brush in 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.419
 flat form I press I'm going up 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.300
 I drag and lift again in point 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.800
 for the purpose of generating this kind of 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.280
 decoration can also be used in 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.569
 rustic we are going to use them and we are going to 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.939
 make another type of arabesques 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.830
 live I use it the white give the 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.629
 details of light in which he will give us 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.629
 life to everything we do 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.560
 let's go to finalize we're just going to 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:10.379
 make the signature and we will withdraw the 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.449
 the tape then first step for this 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.870
 earth tape that we have here we go 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.270
 us to withdraw it and we're going to start 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.279
 see that the color of the background in this case 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.569
 that was white will be reflected in 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.000
 the moment we go to 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.310
 work the video 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.230
 so that simply so that for the 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.650
 person who is watching us simply 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.370
 generate a decorative painting here I am going to 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.370
 withdraw also 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.330
 and I can just give you a 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.379
 setting in that picture giving 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.199
 understand that there are some small 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:44.330
 divisions from one side to the other good for 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.349
 finish let's use the signature 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.349

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.980
