00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.110
 I want to talk to you about a dream of mine 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.930
 applicant has had us between the three and 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.560
 four years as a child happened to me 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.110
 often dreaming of me crossing 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.240
 a wall in exactly a certain way 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.019
 precisely of my house 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.239
 I dreamed of passing and going further into 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.360
 another environment 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:38.360
 when I awoke from this dream I went 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.280
 from the great to the reasonable and large 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.530
 told that exactly at that point 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.019
 there was a door and beyond that 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.339
 door there was enough made in a 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.180
 certain way 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.519
 this was my dream dream mancio that 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.060
 but by the great, reasonable prizes 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:00.590
 it was taken as a dream of madness 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.170
 years later at a distance from many 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.329
 years 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.720
 I discovered that exactly in that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.150
 there was a walled walled door 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 who knows for as much as a hundred from 200 years and to 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.580
 beyond that door the system walled 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.369
 an environment that nobody in my house 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.119
 he knew he existed and he was exactly 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.119
 as I saw it and like myself for many 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.060
 many nights I told that era 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.310
 a house inhabited for generations by the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.039
 my family who knows maybe a memory o 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.630
 any other magical thing the great ones 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:40.110
 the great sensible told me nothing 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 nothing can pass through a solid body 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 and therefore this is only a dream of 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.450
 madness but in reason being a bit of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.350
 madness and madness there is still a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350
 bit of reason 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 a bunch of square heart flower cards in it 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.090
 small today the cards on the table and you 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.550
 I ask to touch a card a cat 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 any touch the card that wants a lot 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.840
 well the 5 black of pink is the card that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 comes to mind to say the chosen 5 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.590
 probably in this deck where 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.420
 we have so many others available 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.190
 This card is the card that choice is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.410
 this is the pack of cigarettes that I 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.660
 asks a spectator for a loan from 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.940
 any viewer or ask for one 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.320
 Cigarette borrowed this is the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.210
 cigarette that I sell we will beat the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.430
 game with the card chosen by 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.740
 spectator and cigarette taken 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.960
 entry into a balancing game 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.180
 support the cigarette so above the 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.360
 paper and we see that cigarette 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.050
 manages to stay balanced on 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.050
 playing card 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.330
 a written in English on the card from 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.770
 game but this is not a game of 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.440
 balance this is a game where we 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.260
 we see an object usually crossing 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.830
 a partner project 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.240
 here is magically the close that for 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:15.120
 pass back and forth through the 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.640
 cigarette playing card I can do 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.230
 completely check the cigarette 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.110
 the card could even be 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.130
 signed by the viewer that being 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.920
 examined had bad sport 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.100
 cigarette crossing the paper from 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.100
 game
