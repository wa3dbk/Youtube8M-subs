can see my new motherboard brain your

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.070 
can see my new motherboard brain your
motherboard<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.969> m5<00:00:15.240> eight<00:00:15.660> seven<00:00:15.960> eight

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
motherboard here is m5 eight seven eight

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.580 
motherboard here is m5 eight seven eight
LM<00:00:16.500> LX<00:00:17.070> version<00:00:17.520> two<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.410> what<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.500> surprising

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
LM LX version two and what is surprising

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.609 
LM LX version two and what is surprising
here<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.900> cheap<00:00:21.900> motherboard<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
here is that this cheap motherboard is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.330 
here is that this cheap motherboard is
actually<00:00:23.840> from<00:00:24.840> Asus<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.619> see<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
actually from Asus as you can see it is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.550 
actually from Asus as you can see it is
cheap<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:26.970> Asus<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.840> believe<00:00:28.289> its

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
cheap but from Asus so I do believe its

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.170 
cheap but from Asus so I do believe its
qualities<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:31.009> undoubtable<00:00:32.750> whatever<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
qualities and undoubtable whatever it is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.549 
qualities and undoubtable whatever it is
so<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> found<00:00:36.840> surprising<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so what I found surprising about this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.869 
so what I found surprising about this
motherboard<00:00:37.829> besides<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
motherboard besides that is that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
motherboard besides that is that
although<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:41.390> mini<00:00:42.390> ATX<00:00:42.660> motherboard

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
although it is a mini ATX motherboard

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.959 
although it is a mini ATX motherboard
here<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:47.039> am3+

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
here as you can see it has an am3+

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.560 
here as you can see it has an am3+
socket<00:00:49.129> at<00:00:50.129> first<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.550> thought<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.300> has

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
socket at first I thought it just has

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.869 
socket at first I thought it just has
this<00:00:52.280> n3<00:00:53.280> socket<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.710> listed<00:00:56.640> here

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this n3 socket because it is listed here

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
this n3 socket because it is listed here
is<00:00:57.680> having<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.390> 760<00:01:00.530> chipset<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
is having a 760 chipset here so I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.179 
is having a 760 chipset here so I
thought<00:01:02.699> normally<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.960> name<00:01:04.470> 3a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
thought normally it will be a name 3a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.719 
thought normally it will be a name 3a
name<00:01:06.060> three<00:01:06.360> normal<00:01:06.780> socket<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.830> phenoms<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
name three normal socket for phenoms and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.490 
name three normal socket for phenoms and
lower<00:01:08.909> processors<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.320> has<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
lower processors but actually it has a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.420 
lower processors but actually it has a
name<00:01:11.159> 3<00:01:11.460> plus<00:01:11.700> socket<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.650> pretty<00:01:14.280> safe

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
name 3 plus socket so you're pretty safe

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.370 
name 3 plus socket so you're pretty safe
here<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.150> another<00:01:15.270> upgrades<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:17.119> another<00:01:18.380> AMD

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
here for another upgrades in another AMD

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
here for another upgrades in another AMD
processor<00:01:20.070> iteration<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> fischeri<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
processor iteration like fischeri and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.859 
processor iteration like fischeri and
the<00:01:22.590> next<00:01:22.830> gen<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.220> piledriver<00:01:23.820> no<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> mean

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the next gen like piledriver no I mean

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.550 
the next gen like piledriver no I mean
bulldozer

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
bulldozer

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
bulldozer
that<00:01:26.159> means<00:01:26.400> steamroller<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> let's<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:30.210> down

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that means steamroller so let's get down

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.350 
that means steamroller so let's get down
to<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> real<00:01:32.000> motherboard<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:34.909> first<00:01:35.909> we

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to the real motherboard here first we

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.429 
to the real motherboard here first we
have<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> city<00:01:38.460> driver<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:39.000> course<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:40.170> as

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
have the city driver of course here as

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
have the city driver of course here as
you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> contains<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.640> chipset<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you can see it contains the chipset and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.100 
you can see it contains the chipset and

one is for Quick Start Guide and another

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.700 
one is for Quick Start Guide and another
one<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.170> more<00:02:11.350> complete<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.990> that's<00:02:14.260> all<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
one is more complete so that's all the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.700 
one is more complete so that's all the
accessories<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:17.040> here<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.670> see

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
accessories and here it is you can see

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.570 
accessories and here it is you can see
the<00:02:20.710> actual<00:02:20.860> board<00:02:21.370> itself<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.980> pretty

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
the actual board itself and it's pretty

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.810 
the actual board itself and it's pretty
slightly<00:02:25.000> covered<00:02:25.390> with<00:02:25.570> an<00:02:26.820> anti-static

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
slightly covered with an anti-static

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.690 
slightly covered with an anti-static
pack<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.310> pretty<00:02:30.520> safe<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.840> is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
pack so it's pretty safe so here it is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.830 
pack so it's pretty safe so here it is
it's<00:02:33.700> pretty<00:02:33.910> small<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.300> yes<00:02:35.220> right<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.750> as

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it's pretty small and yes right so as

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's pretty small and yes right so as
you<00:02:40.870> can<00:02:41.020> see<00:02:41.080> here<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.800> n3<00:02:42.160> plus

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
you can see here it is the n3 plus

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.140 
you can see here it is the n3 plus
socket<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.260> two<00:02:44.500> slots<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.430> memory

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:59.750 

she<00:03:53.299> probably<00:03:55.579> be<00:03:56.579> more<00:03:56.700> just<00:03:57.269> shut<00:03:57.629> GA<00:03:58.440> s<00:03:59.069> what

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
she probably be more just shut GA s what

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.199 
she probably be more just shut GA s what
is<00:03:59.879> it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
is it

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.690 
is it
slot<00:04:00.689> here<00:04:01.049> for<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.470> for<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.920> for<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.310> cable

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
slot here for the for the for the cable

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.990 
slot here for the for the for the cable
on<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> monitor<00:04:04.670> it's<00:04:05.670> quite<00:04:05.879> surprising

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
on the monitor it's quite surprising

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.699 
on the monitor it's quite surprising
because<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.690> small<00:04:06.959> here<00:04:06.989> but<00:04:07.260> it's

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
because it's small here but it's

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.710 
because it's small here but it's
normally<00:04:08.069> though<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.700> will<00:04:08.909> just<00:04:09.060> plug<00:04:09.540> it

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
normally though it will just plug it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.580 
normally though it will just plug it
fine<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:11.010> normal<00:04:11.310> monitors<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.090> as<00:04:13.079> you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
fine on the normal monitors and as you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.349 
fine on the normal monitors and as you
can<00:04:13.769> see<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.450> actual<00:04:15.599> am3+<00:04:16.350> socket

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
can see this is the actual am3+ socket

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.450 
can see this is the actual am3+ socket
here<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.109> written<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.100> am<00:04:20.310> 3b<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:22.070> in<00:04:23.070> its

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
here it is written as I am 3b and in its

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.850 
here it is written as I am 3b and in its
official<00:04:23.970> designation<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.570> suck<00:04:25.500> at<00:04:25.650> nine

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
official designation is suck at nine

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.840 
official designation is suck at nine
four<00:04:26.250> two<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:28.770> can<00:04:28.800> safely<00:04:29.160> say<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.550> this

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
four two so we can safely say that this

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.170 
four two so we can safely say that this
motherboard<00:04:30.180> supports<00:04:30.620> higher<00:04:31.620> end<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
motherboard supports higher end and the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.520 
motherboard supports higher end and the
CPU<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.870> processors<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:36.740> well<00:04:37.740> what's<00:04:38.010> next

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
CPU of processors and well what's next

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.409 
CPU of processors and well what's next
this<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.800> Southbridge<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.760> mean<00:04:42.260> yeah<00:04:43.260> oh

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
this is the Southbridge I mean yeah oh

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.110 
this is the Southbridge I mean yeah oh
this<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:47.070> North<00:04:47.250> Bridge<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.940> North

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
this is this the North Bridge the North

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.640 
this is this the North Bridge the North
Bridge<00:04:48.330> chip<00:04:49.130> 760<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:51.210> then<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.780> have<00:04:51.960> the

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
Bridge chip 760 and then we have the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.779 
Bridge chip 760 and then we have the
south<00:04:52.860> bridge<00:04:53.130> chip<00:04:53.430> over<00:04:53.699> here<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.699> think

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
south bridge chip over here so I think

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.029 
south bridge chip over here so I think
that's<00:04:57.060> pretty<00:04:57.270> much<00:04:57.449> all<00:04:57.630> we<00:04:57.990> have<00:04:58.139> here<00:04:58.470> the

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
that's pretty much all we have here the

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.980 
that's pretty much all we have here the
24<00:04:59.460> pin<00:05:00.000> motherboard<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:02.070> mean<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.729> power<00:05:03.360> source

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
24 pin motherboard I mean a power source

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.010 
24 pin motherboard I mean a power source
for<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.260> motherboard<00:05:04.620> itself<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:06.180> we<00:05:06.930> have

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
for the motherboard itself and we have

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.570 
for the motherboard itself and we have
the<00:05:07.139> SATA<00:05:07.680> 3<00:05:07.830> here<00:05:08.400> 4<00:05:09.410> slots<00:05:10.410> for<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.190> SATA<00:05:11.460> 3

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
the SATA 3 here 4 slots for the SATA 3

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.170 
the SATA 3 here 4 slots for the SATA 3
cables

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
cables

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:23.740 
cables
and<00:05:16.090> what<00:05:17.090> else<00:05:17.270> oh<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.370> here<00:05:23.210> you<00:05:23.330> can<00:05:23.480> see<00:05:23.660> we

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
and what else oh and here you can see we

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.470 
and what else oh and here you can see we
have<00:05:23.870> four<00:05:24.080> pins<00:05:24.410> for<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.710> CPU<00:05:25.010> power<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:26.300> make

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
have four pins for the CPU power so make

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.050 
have four pins for the CPU power so make
sure<00:05:26.510> your<00:05:26.870> PSU<00:05:27.560> or<00:05:27.590> whatever<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:28.670> is

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
sure your PSU or whatever it is

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.670 
sure your PSU or whatever it is
supports<00:05:30.050> this<00:05:30.530> motherboard<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:32.530> think<00:05:33.530> that's

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
supports this motherboard I think that's

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.070 
supports this motherboard I think that's
it<00:05:33.830> for<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.880> motherboard<00:05:36.070> unboxing
