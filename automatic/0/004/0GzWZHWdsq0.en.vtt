see it imprinted through the back a lot
of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> replicas<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.370> back

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
of the replicas you can see on the back

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.510 
of the replicas you can see on the back
side<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.879> wings<00:00:48.120> coming<00:00:48.570> through

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
notice that on a lot of them and then

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you come to look at the back of the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.990 
you come to look at the back of the
watch<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.680> what<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> normally<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.280> also

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
watch and what I normally look for also

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.250 
watch and what I normally look for also
is<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.050> cutout<00:01:02.239> where<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> pin<00:01:03.629> holes<00:01:06.260> very

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
is the cutout where the pin holes very

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.210 
is the cutout where the pin holes very
clean<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:07.770> crisp<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:09.470> lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> replicas

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
clean very crisp a lot of the replicas

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
clean very crisp a lot of the replicas
are<00:01:11.250> choppy<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.229> they<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.409> fit<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
are choppy and they don't fit in this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.450 
are choppy and they don't fit in this
tight<00:01:14.240> kiss<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.540 

now<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.800> pop<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.979> back<00:01:26.159> open

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
now I'm going to pop the back open

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:42.030 
now I'm going to pop the back open
really<00:01:26.790> quick

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.880 

okay<00:01:43.040> so

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.310 

here<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:49.700> what<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.120> inside<00:01:50.540> of<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.810> case<00:01:51.020> back

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
here is what the inside of the case back

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.460 
here is what the inside of the case back
looks<00:01:51.620> like<00:01:52.060> should<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.390> swirl<00:01:53.659> pattern

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.719 

inside<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.950> bright<00:02:01.190> Lynx<00:02:01.550> was

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
inside there and the bright Lynx was

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.600 
inside there and the bright Lynx was
made

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.160 

backside<00:02:11.420> okay<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.750> look<00:02:12.930> at<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
backside okay then we look at the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.070 
backside okay then we look at the
movement<00:02:13.680> next<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.240> authentic

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
movement next and here is the authentic

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.870 
movement next and here is the authentic
Breitling<00:02:19.770> movement<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.459> supposed<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
Breitling movement that is supposed to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.559 
Breitling movement that is supposed to
be<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.240> watch<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:22.819> lot<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> replicas

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
be in the watch a lot of the replicas

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.860 
be in the watch a lot of the replicas
actually<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.319> movements<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.540> look<00:02:27.540> pretty

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
actually have movements that look pretty

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.650 
actually have movements that look pretty
similar<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.760> look<00:02:32.970> inside<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
similar and you can look inside the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.780 
similar and you can look inside the
watch<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> couple<00:02:34.739> little<00:02:34.860> markings<00:02:35.489> if

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
watch for a couple little markings if

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.710 
watch for a couple little markings if
you<00:02:35.910> had<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> loop<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.819> one<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.209> pretty

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
you had a loop but this one is pretty

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.110 
you had a loop but this one is pretty
obvious<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.620> real<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:41.910> can

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
obvious that it's real and then you can

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.280 
obvious that it's real and then you can
also<00:02:42.410> always<00:02:43.410> check<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> markings<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:45.290> for

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
also always check the markings there for

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:55.340 
also always check the markings there for
the<00:02:46.380> bracelet<00:02:46.830> type<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:53.360> that's<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.660> about<00:02:55.140> it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
the bracelet type and that's a about it

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.860 
the bracelet type and that's a about it
on<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.650> one
