00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
then a hat came along in cydia that was
called<00:00:28.199> activate<00:00:28.769> mms<00:00:29.099> where<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.119> downloaded

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
called activate mms where you downloaded

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.709 
called activate mms where you downloaded
it<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.109> gave<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.830> camera<00:00:32.189> icon

went<00:00:43.379> away<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.370> activate<00:00:44.820> mms<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.450> not

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
went away so the activate mms is not
