music<00:00:03.360> using<00:00:03.750> state<00:00:04.080> switches<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.710> wise<00:00:05.029> in

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
music using state switches and wise in

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.220 
music using state switches and wise in
order<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.359> do<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.600> you're<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.990> have<00:00:07.080> to

order to do this you're going to have to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.780 
order to do this you're going to have to
have<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.560> musical<00:00:08.010> track<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.580> split

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
done loading in them all and it should

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.010 
done loading in them all and it should
look<00:02:23.010> something<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.900> next

thing you have to do is actually create

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.860 
thing you have to do is actually create
the<00:02:26.400> states<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:27.120> all<00:02:27.360> these<00:02:27.510> different

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the states for all these different

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.780 
the states for all these different
layers<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:29.100> order<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.640> you're

to<00:03:19.200> do<00:03:19.320> next<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.190> need<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.340> actually<00:03:20.490> go<00:03:20.760> to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
to do next is you need to actually go to

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.550 
to do next is you need to actually go to
each<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.360> these<00:03:21.540> music<00:03:21.930> containers<00:03:22.380> and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
each one of these music containers and

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.199 
each one of these music containers and
on<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.310> container<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.820> need<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> actually

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
on that container you need to actually

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.320 
on that container you need to actually
add<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.570> music<00:03:25.110> segment<00:03:25.650> below<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.820> for

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
add the music segment below it so for

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.090 
add the music segment below it so for
the<00:03:27.450> actual<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.870> container<00:03:28.260> if<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.740> just<00:03:28.920> go

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the actual all container if you just go

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.340 
the actual all container if you just go
to<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.370> all<00:03:29.520> segment<00:03:30.150> bloat<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.540> drag<00:03:31.230> it

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
to the all segment bloat and drag it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.590 
to the all segment bloat and drag it
over<00:03:31.470> here<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.130> group<00:03:32.310> segment<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.570> can

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
over here to the group segment you can

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.930 
over here to the group segment you can
see<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.080> it's<00:03:34.230> edit<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.650> then<00:03:35.550> from<00:03:35.760> there

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
see that it's edit and then from there

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.520 
see that it's edit and then from there
you<00:03:36.270> go<00:03:36.420> over<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.690> loop<00:03:36.840> counter<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.380> hit

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
you go over to the loop counter and hit

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.990 
you go over to the loop counter and hit
down<00:03:37.740> on<00:03:38.010> both<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.400> them<00:03:38.520> so<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:38.910> are

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
down on both of them so there are

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.790 
down on both of them so there are
infinite<00:03:39.420> loops<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.470> then<00:03:40.530> you're<00:03:40.650> going<00:03:40.740> to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
infinite loops and then you're going to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.440 
infinite loops and then you're going to
continue<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.520> for<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.030> other<00:03:42.150> three

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.580 

so<00:03:45.450> once<00:03:45.600> you're<00:03:45.750> done<00:03:45.780> loading<00:03:46.110> all<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
so once you're done loading all of the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.320 
so once you're done loading all of the
music<00:03:46.770> segments<00:03:47.310> into<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.640> music<00:03:47.910> containers

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
music segments into the music containers

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.210 
music segments into the music containers
the<00:03:48.959> next<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.350> did<00:03:49.500> they<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:50.040> going

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the next thing you did they do is going

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.300 
the next thing you did they do is going
to<00:03:50.280> go<00:03:50.400> over<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.030> music<00:03:51.330> switch<00:03:51.750> container

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
to go over to the music switch container

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.470 
to go over to the music switch container
now<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.580> switch<00:03:53.790> container<00:03:54.150> you're<00:03:54.330> going

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
now on the switch container you're going

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940 
now on the switch container you're going
to<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.630> over<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.930> switch<00:03:55.230> type<00:03:55.470> over<00:03:55.740> here

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
to go over to the switch type over here

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.350 
to go over to the switch type over here
and<00:03:56.100> you're<00:03:56.190> gonna<00:03:56.280> actually<00:03:56.520> hit<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.060> state

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
and you're gonna actually hit the state

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.630 
and you're gonna actually hit the state
button<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.980> then<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> group<00:03:59.459> you're

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
button and then in the group you're

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.280 
button and then in the group you're
gonna<00:03:59.730> go<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.360> drop-down<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.080> you're

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
gonna go to the drop-down and you're

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.010 
gonna go to the drop-down and you're
going<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.470> click<00:04:01.620> music<00:04:01.800> level<00:04:02.280> 1<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.020> then

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
going to click music level 1 and then

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.330 
going to click music level 1 and then
for<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.410> defaults<00:04:04.740> which<00:04:04.920> state<00:04:05.160> you're

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
for the defaults which state you're

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.940 
for the defaults which state you're
gonna<00:04:05.490> put<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> dead<00:04:06.209> base<00:04:06.620> so<00:04:07.620> now<00:04:07.740> that<00:04:07.830> you

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
gonna put a dead base so now that you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.400 
gonna put a dead base so now that you
added<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.190> state<00:04:08.520> group<00:04:08.730> music<00:04:09.120> level<00:04:09.390> 1<00:04:09.570> down

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
added the state group music level 1 down

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.050 
added the state group music level 1 down
here<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:10.830> can<00:04:10.980> actually<00:04:11.100> see<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.520> individual

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
here you can actually see the individual

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.360 
here you can actually see the individual
states<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.410> what<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.680> need<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.860> do<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.280> you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
states so what you need to do is you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.970 
states so what you need to do is you
need<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.550> actually<00:04:14.760> drag<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:16.350> individual

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
need to actually drag the individual

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.290 
need to actually drag the individual
music<00:04:17.640> containers<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.049> States

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.900 

once<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.259> have<00:04:25.379> that<00:04:25.410> done<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.520> final<00:04:26.789> thing

once you have that done the final thing

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.189 
once you have that done the final thing
you<00:04:26.940> actually<00:04:27.210> have<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.509> is<00:04:27.780> go<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
you actually have to do is go to the

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.800 
you actually have to do is go to the
transitions<00:04:28.770> tabs<00:04:29.099> up<00:04:29.340> here<00:04:29.690> what<00:04:30.690> you're

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
transitions tabs up here what you're

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.730 
transitions tabs up here what you're
going<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.990> be<00:04:31.050> doing<00:04:31.259> is<00:04:31.379> actually<00:04:31.560> creating

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
going to be doing is actually creating

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.809 
going to be doing is actually creating
crossfades

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
crossfades

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.119 
crossfades
so<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.930> can<00:04:34.199> leave<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.560> source<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.069> the

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
so you can leave the source and the

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.369 
so you can leave the source and the
destination<00:04:35.220> at<00:04:35.789> any<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.240> then<00:04:36.900> when<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.259> go

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
destination at any and then when you go

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.529 
destination at any and then when you go
down<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.740> source<00:04:37.979> here<00:04:38.310> click<00:04:39.300> on<00:04:39.419> this

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
down to the source here click on this

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.089 
down to the source here click on this
drop<00:04:39.750> down<00:04:39.930> here<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.349> as<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.860> see<00:04:40.919> you

drop down here and as you can see you

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.770 
drop down here and as you can see you
have<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> lot<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.490> different<00:04:41.789> options<00:04:41.970> for<00:04:42.360> the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.499 
hit the edit now here we are in the
music<00:04:55.949> fade<00:04:56.310> editor<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.060> music<00:04:57.300> fade<00:04:57.479> out

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
music fade editor and the music fade out

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.180 
music fade editor and the music fade out
or<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.930> have<00:04:57.960> three<00:04:58.319> options<00:04:58.650> which<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:58.949> time

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
or you have three options which is time

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.330 
or you have three options which is time
offset<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.909> your<00:05:00.120> curve<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.919> time<00:05:02.130> is

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
offset and your curve and the time is

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.370 
offset and your curve and the time is
actually<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.970> time<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.750> total<00:05:04.080> elapsed

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
actually the time of the total elapsed

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.040 
actually the time of the total elapsed
to<00:05:04.560> fade<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:06.030> what<00:05:06.180> I'm<00:05:06.240> going<00:05:06.389> to<00:05:06.419> do<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.900> I'm

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
to fade so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.870 
to fade so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.409> make<00:05:07.860> this<00:05:08.310> into<00:05:10.580> one<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.729> half

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
going to make this into one and a half

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.050 
going to make this into one and a half
second<00:05:12.270> long<00:05:12.389> fade<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:14.370> then<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.729> offset

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
second long fade and then on the offset

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.490 
second long fade and then on the offset
you're<00:05:15.180> actually<00:05:15.389> going<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.599> slide<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.380> be

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
you're actually going to slide it to be

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.430 
you're actually going to slide it to be
right<00:05:16.830> in<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.190> middle<00:05:17.400> here<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:18.259> then<00:05:19.259> for

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
right in the middle here and then for

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.540 
right in the middle here and then for
the<00:05:19.500> curve<00:05:19.710> I'm<00:05:20.009> going<00:05:20.219> to<00:05:20.340> choose<00:05:20.520> a

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
the curve I'm going to choose a

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.700 
the curve I'm going to choose a
logarithmic<00:05:21.090> curve<00:05:21.289> now<00:05:22.289> I'm<00:05:22.379> going<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.590> close

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
logarithmic curve now I'm going to close

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.399 
logarithmic curve now I'm going to close
out<00:05:22.919> of<00:05:22.949> that<00:05:23.870> then<00:05:24.870> I'm<00:05:24.960> going<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.110> go<00:05:25.229> down<00:05:25.379> to

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
out of that then I'm going to go down to

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.159 
out of that then I'm going to go down to
the<00:05:26.039> destination<00:05:26.669> and<00:05:27.300> I'm<00:05:27.419> going<00:05:27.659> to<00:05:27.810> go<00:05:28.080> to

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
the destination and I'm going to go to

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.709 
the destination and I'm going to go to
the<00:05:28.349> sync<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.830> drop<00:05:29.159> down<00:05:29.340> window<00:05:29.520> as<00:05:30.300> with<00:05:30.599> the

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
the sync to drop down window as with the

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.270 
the sync to drop down window as with the
exit<00:05:31.020> source<00:05:31.259> you<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.740> lot<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.889> different

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
exit source you have a lot of different

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.730 
exit source you have a lot of different
options<00:05:32.400> for<00:05:32.699> the<00:05:33.150> destination<00:05:33.620> since<00:05:34.620> all

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
options for the destination since all

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.170 
options for the destination since all
these<00:05:34.830> files<00:05:35.069> are<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.340> exact<00:05:35.520> same<00:05:35.550> timeline

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
these files are the exact same timeline

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.059 
these files are the exact same timeline
I'm<00:05:36.659> just<00:05:36.930> going<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.110> tell<00:05:37.289> it<00:05:37.319> to<00:05:37.380> do<00:05:37.770> same

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
I'm just going to tell it to do same

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.830 
I'm just going to tell it to do same
time<00:05:38.340> as<00:05:38.520> playing<00:05:38.729> segments<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.360> then<00:05:39.719> I'm

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
time as playing segments and then I'm

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.450 
time as playing segments and then I'm
going<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.020> go<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.259> the<00:05:40.469> fade<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:40.889> button<00:05:41.159> click

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
going to go to the fade in button click

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.209 
going to go to the fade in button click
on<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.759> and<00:05:41.880> I'm<00:05:42.090> gonna<00:05:42.210> hit<00:05:42.389> edit<00:05:42.539> for<00:05:42.840> this

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
on it and I'm gonna hit edit for this

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.990 
on it and I'm gonna hit edit for this
general<00:05:44.219> for<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.400> fade<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.699> want<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:44.940> to

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
general for the fade and you want it to

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.510 
general for the fade and you want it to
be<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.180> exact<00:05:45.419> opposite<00:05:45.810> of<00:05:45.870> your<00:05:46.020> fade<00:05:46.229> out

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
be the exact opposite of your fade out

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.430 
be the exact opposite of your fade out
so<00:05:47.520> you're<00:05:48.389> going<00:05:48.539> to<00:05:48.569> have<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.900> be<00:05:49.279> 1.5<00:05:51.440> slide

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
so you're going to have it be 1.5 slide

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.670 
so you're going to have it be 1.5 slide
the<00:05:52.590> offset<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.759> middle<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.500> create<00:05:55.500> a

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
the offset to the middle and create a

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.850 
the offset to the middle and create a
logarithmic<00:05:56.039> curve<00:05:56.279> and<00:05:56.699> exit<00:05:57.479> out<00:05:57.569> of<00:05:57.599> that

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
logarithmic curve and exit out of that

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.930 
logarithmic curve and exit out of that
so<00:05:58.860> now<00:05:58.979> that<00:05:59.009> you've<00:05:59.219> done<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.669> final

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
so now that you've done that the final

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.980 
so now that you've done that the final
step<00:06:00.120> they<00:06:00.240> actually<00:06:00.509> have<00:06:00.599> to<00:06:00.690> take<00:06:00.870> before

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
step they actually have to take before

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.899 
step they actually have to take before
you<00:06:01.259> can<00:06:01.289> audition<00:06:01.500> this<00:06:01.919> is<00:06:02.550> you're<00:06:02.729> going<00:06:02.849> to

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
you can audition this is you're going to

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.519 
you can audition this is you're going to
go<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.060> each<00:06:03.150> one<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.539> the<00:06:03.719> individual<00:06:04.259> waves

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
go to each one of the individual waves

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:05.809 
go to each one of the individual waves
and<00:06:04.800> you're<00:06:04.889> going<00:06:05.009> to<00:06:05.069> double<00:06:05.340> click<00:06:05.460> on<00:06:05.639> it

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
and you're going to double click on it

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.939 
and you're going to double click on it
and<00:06:05.969> then<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.960> music<00:06:07.080> segment<00:06:07.590> editor<00:06:07.860> is

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
and then the music segment editor is

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.890 
and then the music segment editor is
going<00:06:08.130> to<00:06:08.190> come<00:06:08.310> up<00:06:08.430> in<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:09.300> music<00:06:09.449> segment

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
going to come up in the music segment

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.120 
going to come up in the music segment
editor<00:06:10.169> you'll<00:06:10.319> notice<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:10.650> have<00:06:10.680> an<00:06:10.889> entry

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
editor you'll notice you have an entry

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.670 
editor you'll notice you have an entry
cue<00:06:11.400> and<00:06:11.610> an<00:06:12.000> exit<00:06:12.300> cue<00:06:12.449> and<00:06:12.719> these<00:06:13.380> are<00:06:13.529> used

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
cue and an exit cue and these are used

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.409 
cue and an exit cue and these are used
for<00:06:13.830> setting<00:06:14.009> loops<00:06:14.310> if<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.180> actually

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
for setting loops if you actually

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.089 
for setting loops if you actually
created<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.810> song<00:06:16.020> with<00:06:16.229> an<00:06:16.380> introduction<00:06:16.830> or

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
created a song with an introduction or

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.550 
created a song with an introduction or
an<00:06:17.610> outro<00:06:18.090> what<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:18.479> can<00:06:18.719> do<00:06:18.930> is<00:06:19.080> you<00:06:19.169> can<00:06:19.289> set

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
an outro what you can do is you can set

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.680 
an outro what you can do is you can set
the<00:06:19.710> loop<00:06:19.889> to<00:06:20.340> specific<00:06:20.940> time<00:06:21.150> frames<00:06:21.479> and

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
the loop to specific time frames and

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.899 
the loop to specific time frames and
then<00:06:22.440> wise<00:06:22.740> will<00:06:22.949> actually<00:06:23.250> play<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.550> intro

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
then wise will actually play the intro

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.059 
then wise will actually play the intro
and<00:06:24.120> then<00:06:24.630> it<00:06:24.750> will<00:06:24.870> strut<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.229> loop<00:06:25.440> and<00:06:25.650> then

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
and then it will strut the loop and then

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:27.409 
and then it will strut the loop and then
after<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.430> loop<00:06:26.550> is<00:06:26.699> completed<00:06:27.060> it'll

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
after the loop is completed it'll

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.999 
after the loop is completed it'll
actually<00:06:27.539> play<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.960> fall-off<00:06:28.169> as<00:06:28.469> well<00:06:28.680> when

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
actually play the fall-off as well when

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.469 
actually play the fall-off as well when
it<00:06:29.130> loops<00:06:29.310> if<00:06:29.729> you<00:06:29.819> want<00:06:29.969> to<00:06:30.029> make<00:06:30.120> sure<00:06:30.150> that

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
it loops if you want to make sure that

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.719 
it loops if you want to make sure that
it's<00:06:30.659> snapped<00:06:31.050> to<00:06:31.199> bars<00:06:31.440> and<00:06:31.650> beats<00:06:31.800> so<00:06:32.699> that

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
it's snapped to bars and beats so that

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.300 
it's snapped to bars and beats so that
way<00:06:33.060> it<00:06:33.330> actually<00:06:33.389> syncs<00:06:34.139> up<00:06:34.259> to<00:06:34.500> the<00:06:34.830> end<00:06:35.039> of

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
way it actually syncs up to the end of

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.140 
way it actually syncs up to the end of
the<00:06:35.460> file

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.189 

so<00:06:39.150> now<00:06:39.270> that<00:06:39.330> this<00:06:39.540> one<00:06:39.720> is<00:06:39.810> done<00:06:39.960> you<00:06:40.080> can<00:06:40.110> go

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
so now that this one is done you can go

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.090 
so now that this one is done you can go
ahead<00:06:40.290> and<00:06:40.410> do<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:40.650> for<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.830> other<00:06:40.860> three<00:06:43.100> so

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
ahead and do it for the other three so

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.890 
ahead and do it for the other three so
now<00:06:44.190> that<00:06:44.280> all<00:06:44.400> for<00:06:44.699> the<00:06:44.880> music<00:06:45.180> segment<00:06:45.570> entry
