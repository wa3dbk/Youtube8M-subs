00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Ciudad Juarez more than 800 students from 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.819
 the state high school 30 to 12 is 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.940
 they are doing the work 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.950
 Academics without electric power 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.080
 executives claim that doing so they have 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 stayed since last Wednesday 21 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 January, they expect authorities 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.330
 educators solve the problem 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330
 soon 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.760
 in high school 30 12 of the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.260
 Colonia Salvárcar have more than one 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.980
 week without the energy service 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.980
 electric 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.400
 the federal commission of electricity 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.890
 disconnected the campus from the network because 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.230
 doing for unknown reasons has not 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 paid more than 46 thousand pesos of the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.310
 bimester 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.130
 Well, if they come to design the teachers in 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.660
 your first question that when they arrive 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.910
 especially the first few hours and there are the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.640
 there is not and for example with this equipment 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.380
 with this group just that they were going to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 make exhibitions with which they were going to 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.670
 pass slides them if they arrive and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.519
 they ask and it's already good light 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.070
 has not arrived 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.100
 we seek to solve the things of another 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.100
 way 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.220
 what we are looking for is to motivate them to 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.590
 continue because as we all know 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.470
 we will always find adversities and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.660
 this is one of them and it's a simple and 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.230
 simple but I think you have to 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.980
 reinforce that desire to continue and to 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.050
 keep going 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.660
 although classes have not been suspended 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.340
 of the two shifts the more than 800 students 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.800
 they are half staying with their 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.480
 studies the teachers left aside 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.880
 activities such as exhibitions and 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.940
 projections in the computer center no 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 There are conditions to perform them 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.000
 it is difficult for us, for example, when 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.520
 there is light is difficult for us for example in 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.610
 the themes of the exhibitions we're going 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.790
 to expose a about a subject and some 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.580
 teams worked on what is in the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.380
 memory of huelva and therefore the estimable 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.619
 It was not possible because there was no 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.650
 light and at other times when we arrived 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.300
 to the rooms it is completely dark 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.030
 and it is difficult for us to read or read 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.250
 can write among other things if 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.410
 there would be light we would appreciate it 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.020
 in the afternoon shift the situation 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.610
 aggravates once the sun goes down it 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.430
 You have to ask parents 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.560
 pick up your children the teachers are 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.860
 worried because at the end of the cycle 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.080
 school will be affected was notified to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.440
 the cedh of the situation but they have not 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.440
 had a response 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.440
 this was last week on wednesday 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.230
 almost at the end of the schedule as 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.430
 One and a half were here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.740
 informing those who were going to do us the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 cut for lack of straw and then 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.460
 logically that affects us quite a lot 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.500
 because the administrative work is 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.890
 totally stopped 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.680
 assessments are coming this month that 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.500
 comes situations from the boards of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.230
 material advice all that we work 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.860
 with computers and with cannons 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.600
 if we are seeing how like this one can 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.870
 carry out our work for lack 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.870
 of these 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.250
 to take the administrative work out of 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.580
 the school a neighbor passed them from 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.840
 service through an extension 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.540
 They are behind in capturing 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.360
 qualifications only have one 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.650
 computer because of this situation 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.920
 will be prepared for 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.920
