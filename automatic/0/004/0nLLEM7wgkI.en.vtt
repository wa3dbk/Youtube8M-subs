normal profile so you have to change the
last<00:01:44.330> three<00:01:44.660> numbers<00:01:45.160> keep<00:01:46.160> track<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.550> these

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
last three numbers keep track of these

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.470 
last three numbers keep track of these
numbers<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:48.370> you<00:01:49.370> won't<00:01:49.640> get<00:01:49.820> your<00:01:49.940> profiles

mixed<00:01:50.750> up<00:01:50.840> on<00:01:50.960> double<00:01:51.350> duplicates<00:01:51.830> an<00:01:51.950> old

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
mixed up on double duplicates an old

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.790 
mixed up on double duplicates an old
speaker<00:01:52.730> up<00:01:52.850> file<00:01:53.150> get<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:54.290> three

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
speaker up file get to do this three

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.180 
speaker up file get to do this three
times<00:01:55.030> threat<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.180> rename<00:01:56.660> it<00:01:56.870> and<00:01:57.830> change<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
times threat to rename it and change the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.560 
times threat to rename it and change the
last<00:01:58.400> three<00:01:58.790> numbers<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.210> repeat

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.249 

now<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.780> next<00:02:04.870> step<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.670> open<00:02:06.940> my<00:02:07.090> mo<00:02:07.630> do

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
now the next step is to open my mo do

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.089 
now the next step is to open my mo do
it's<00:02:09.830> rehashes<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.849> resins<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.230> makes

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
it's rehashes and resins it so it makes

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.759 
it's rehashes and resins it so it makes
it<00:02:13.250> legit<00:02:13.670> pretty<00:02:13.939> much<00:02:14.230> with<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.379> last<00:02:15.530> three

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
it legit pretty much with the last three

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.619 
it legit pretty much with the last three
numbers<00:02:15.920> typing<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> same<00:02:16.970> last<00:02:17.450> three

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
numbers typing the same last three

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.059 
numbers typing the same last three
numbers<00:02:17.750> they've<00:02:18.019> been<00:02:18.140> typing<00:02:18.319> less<00:02:18.680> to

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
numbers they've been typing less to

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.220 
numbers they've been typing less to
rehash<00:02:19.939> and<00:02:20.150> resign<00:02:20.450> simple<00:02:21.079> as<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:23.230> I'll

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
rehash and resign simple as that I'll

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.339 
rehash and resign simple as that I'll
close<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:25.390> now<00:02:26.390> go<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.690> where<00:02:27.019> all<00:02:27.170> your

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
close it now go to where all your

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.869 
close it now go to where all your
