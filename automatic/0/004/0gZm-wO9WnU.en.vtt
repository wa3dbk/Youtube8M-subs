00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
coming in but I mean if you consider the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.410

silenced<00:01:46.409> weapons<00:01:46.649> new<00:01:46.890> weapons<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
silenced weapons new weapons I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.749

personally<00:01:48.420> don't<00:01:48.689> really<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> mean<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.770> they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
personally don't really I mean that they

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
personally don't really I mean that they
have<00:01:50.790> burst<00:01:51.119> fire<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> guess<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.960> we'll<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.710> how
