00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
for example they stop here queen of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
for example they stop here queen of
diamonds<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:09.210> queen<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.810> diamonds<00:01:10.380> show

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
diamonds right queen of diamonds show

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
diamonds right queen of diamonds show
them<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.939> place<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.540> screen<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
them and you place the screen of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.969 
them and you place the screen of
diamonds<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> middle<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:16.320> appears<00:01:16.770> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
diamonds in the middle but it appears on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.760 
diamonds in the middle but it appears on
the<00:01:17.130> top<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.990> works<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.380> these

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the top right so it works like these

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.190 
the top right so it works like these
guys

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
guys

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
guys
so<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:23.100> riffle<00:01:23.460> through<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> cards<00:01:23.850> pick<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
so you riffle through the cards pick a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.410 
so you riffle through the cards pick a
card<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> random<00:01:25.830> card<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.640> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
card we just need a random card right so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.069 
card we just need a random card right so
then<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.340> slide<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.909> card<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.720> your

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
then you slide out the card so your

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.130 
then you slide out the card so your
thumb<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> flip<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.509> hand<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
thumb right and you flip your hand so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410 
thumb right and you flip your hand so
you<00:01:34.229> show<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> card<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you show them the card is right here and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.710 
you show them the card is right here and
then<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> try<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> push<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.970> while<00:01:39.479> you're

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
then you try to push it in while you're

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
then you try to push it in while you're
referring<00:01:40.259> through<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> cards<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
referring through the cards right so it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.359 
referring through the cards right so it
and<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> happens<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> in

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and it happens like this so in the in

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.240 
and it happens like this so in the in
the<00:01:44.720> probably<00:01:45.720> notice<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.649> did<00:01:46.979> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the probably notice now what I did so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.660 
the probably notice now what I did so
you<00:01:47.280> never<00:01:47.610> put<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> car<00:01:48.479> actually<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
you never put the car actually in in the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.520 
you never put the car actually in in the
in<00:01:52.670> between<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.240> cars<00:01:53.510> right<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.500> looks

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
in between the cars right so it looks

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.870 
in between the cars right so it looks
like<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.430> do<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.820> kind<00:01:56.120> of<00:01:56.210> move<00:01:57.880> so

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
like this you do this kind of move so
