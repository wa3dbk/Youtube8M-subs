00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 and 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.400
 us what we do as scientists 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.300
 it's an intelligent symbol which means 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.420
 that if you do not laugh you can asshole 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.040
 us unlike politicians 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.650
 from this country we do answer 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.660
 questions so in the end if you have the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.880
 mobile on with wifi ssa to butt 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.420
 you can not ask questions by the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.340
 twitter 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.500
 the other radiations that cross us 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.360
 they are more exotic they come to us from the universe 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.690
 the astrophysicists we call 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.950
 scientifically to these rays that come 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.460
 of the cosmos rays 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.670
 coconut 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.850
 and these cosmic rays come from certain 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.300
 places in the universe reach us 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.300
 exactly from 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.660
 as well 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.770
 I'm going to talk about the black plague that 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.409
 it's not that which escapes us from the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.079
 responsible for being 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.100
 I come to talk about the pandemic that 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:19.159
 it swept europe in the 14th century in just 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.570
 6 years 50 million people 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.050
 they succumbed to the attack 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.110
 of yersinia pestis a thousand bacteria 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.450
 times smaller than the millimeter 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.340
 shit say the prokaryotes that do not 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.800
 has no cell nucleus to save its 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.860
 Adn that has everything is ordered thrown away 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 out there I guess the bacteria to 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.950
 point of attacking speaking ones with 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.170
 the others saying one to the other pot 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.120
 and baby, start expressing the alpha toxin 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.370
 that we are going to attack and the other saying no 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.710
 I can not find the gene they treat me 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.510
 of the months or more where will I go to 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.170
 stay without attacking 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.080
 how is it possible that these cells so 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.870
 small so disorganized will cause 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.620
 so much harm to human hermaphroditism 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.750
 simultaneous presence of sexual organs 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.740
 male and female together at the same time 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.520
 in the same individual 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.830
 you can pass it from the host you alone 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.530
 without needing anything now yes be careful 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.950
 with masturbation because in addition to being 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.590
 sin and leave you blind you can stay 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 pregnant 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.730
 clear father and single mothers in the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.599
 same guy 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.599
 what would gallardon think of all this 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.599
 exiled
