00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
let's see what I can get upside down

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.519 
let's see what I can get upside down
gurgi<00:00:25.660> mk2<00:00:27.210> interesting<00:00:28.210> I<00:00:28.480> don't<00:00:29.230> why<00:00:29.349> some

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
gurgi mk2 interesting I don't why some

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.050 
gurgi mk2 interesting I don't why some
of<00:00:29.590> them<00:00:29.710> end<00:00:29.890> up<00:00:29.980> upside<00:00:30.189> down<00:00:30.640> that's<00:00:30.849> really

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
of them end up upside down that's really

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.410 
of them end up upside down that's really
kind<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.300> crazy<00:00:31.950> sometimes<00:00:32.950> thats<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.700> you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
kind of crazy sometimes thats and you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.810 
kind of crazy sometimes thats and you
know<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.780> their<00:00:34.870> packaging<00:00:35.410> I<00:00:35.680> guess<00:00:36.280> plant

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
know and their packaging I guess plant

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.729 
know and their packaging I guess plant
or<00:00:37.030> whatever<00:00:37.329> sometimes<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.200> rares<00:00:38.380> end<00:00:38.650> up

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
or whatever sometimes the rares end up

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.680 
or whatever sometimes the rares end up
all<00:00:38.950> you<00:00:39.610> know<00:00:39.730> but<00:00:40.000> backwards<00:00:40.270> I<00:00:40.720> guess<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.480> if

card<00:01:01.300> like<00:01:01.510> blue<00:01:01.900> dragon<00:01:02.470> ninja<00:01:02.650> from<00:01:03.040> me<00:01:03.449> very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
card like blue dragon ninja from me very

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.810 
card like blue dragon ninja from me very
cool<00:01:05.549> awesome<00:01:06.990> okay<00:01:07.990> first<00:01:08.979> holographic<00:01:09.640> two

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
cool awesome okay first holographic two

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.380 
cool awesome okay first holographic two
of<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.420> day<00:01:11.130> alright<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.280> one<00:01:12.520> whole<00:01:13.119> lot<00:01:13.299> of

of the day alright so one whole lot of
four<00:01:13.570> packs<00:01:13.780> that's<00:01:14.049> not<00:01:14.170> too<00:01:14.289> bad<00:01:14.320> perhaps<00:01:15.009> we

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
four packs that's not too bad perhaps we

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.399 
four packs that's not too bad perhaps we
can<00:01:15.340> improve<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.850> with<00:01:15.999> super<00:01:16.899> dimensional

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
can improve it with super dimensional

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.270 
can improve it with super dimensional
robot<00:01:17.890> galaxy<00:01:18.159> destroyer<00:01:18.990> very<00:01:19.990> cool<00:01:20.280> second

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
robot galaxy destroyer very cool second

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.450 
robot galaxy destroyer very cool second
hollow<00:01:21.460> pool<00:01:21.729> of<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.969> day<00:01:22.119> now<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:24.069> lot<00:01:24.429> of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
hollow pool of the day now so a lot of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.399 
hollow pool of the day now so a lot of
success<00:01:24.909> that's<00:01:25.179> about<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.539> one<00:01:26.020> out<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> every

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
success that's about a one out of every

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.709 
success that's about a one out of every
three<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.859> a<00:01:26.950> holographic<00:01:27.460> car<00:01:27.759> can<00:01:28.450> we<00:01:28.600> do

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
three is a holographic car can we do

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.910 
three is a holographic car can we do
even<00:01:28.990> better<00:01:29.109> maybe<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.850> we<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:32.439> right

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
even better maybe maybe we can all right

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.620 
even better maybe maybe we can all right
see<00:01:33.399> if<00:01:33.460> we<00:01:33.549> keep<00:01:33.819> that<00:01:34.060> average<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:37.539> we

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
see if we keep that average what do we

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.539 
see if we keep that average what do we
get<00:01:37.810> out<00:01:37.929> of<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.170> one<00:01:38.439> we<00:01:39.429> have<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:40.329> 0<00:01:41.549> Alka

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
get out of this one we have a 0 Alka

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.859 
get out of this one we have a 0 Alka

still<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:02.950> two<00:02:03.159> more<00:02:03.340> packs<00:02:03.639> left<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.450> cool<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
still have two more packs left to cool a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.590 
still have two more packs left to cool a
couple<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.139> really<00:02:05.350> good<00:02:05.439> seats<00:02:05.859> and<00:02:06.009> hollows

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
couple of really good seats and hollows

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.240 
couple of really good seats and hollows
so<00:02:07.600> far<00:02:07.840> we've<00:02:08.140> opened<00:02:08.440> eight<00:02:08.560> packs<00:02:08.860> found

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so far we've opened eight packs found

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.370 
so far we've opened eight packs found
three<00:02:09.610> holographic<00:02:10.209> cards<00:02:10.450> out<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> that's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
three holographic cards out of it that's

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.910 
three holographic cards out of it that's
actually<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:12.220> good<00:02:12.490> for<00:02:13.150> cool<00:02:13.630> ratio<00:02:14.080> but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
actually really good for cool ratio but
