00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 the worst dream gum a4 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.670
 tagi alexey record 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.740
 greet you friends my name is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.980
 Eugene and I want to tell you this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.630
 great game like super metroid 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.930
 in order to fall in love with this game 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.199
 enough 5 reasons this feast is your nickname 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.900
 great second gameplay great 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.269
 step schedule awesome music yes and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.040
 the plot here does not smell bad but of course 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.800
 the same unique atmosphere 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.600
 the atmosphere of the dark alien station 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.390
 filled with unpleasant and quite 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.909
 hostile organism atmosphere 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 loneliness loneliness from the fact that 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.220
 the only person on the whole planet is 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 main character Samus Aran 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.379
 and the feeling that you are an uninvited guest is not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.659
 get rid of until the end of the game and absolutely not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.760
 from whom to wait for help you need to hope 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.549
 only on themselves and only their own 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.659
 abilities and iron will not help you 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:08.229
 overcome all the way from the beginning 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.630
 the treasured finale of super metroid is 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.640
 the third in a series of games she came out in 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.140
 light in the distant ninety-fourth on 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.240
 Super Nintendo Consoles 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.049
 the game got a lot of laudatory 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.689
 reviews for graphics music and pretty 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.609
 long occupied the top position in the lists 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.659
 liber of all time as no wonder 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.789
 because the game is really good based 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.939
 super metroid no comics were released 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.310
 even were going to make a film because 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.799
 the plot of this game is chronological order 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.739
 narrated in after the first two parts 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.599
 I would like to tell a little 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:46.149
 prehistory some galactic 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.840
 federation for world peace 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.090
 discovered on the planet sir 388 a new species 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.479
 flying creatures and gave it a name 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.450
 meters of these creatures suck life 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.149
 energy of their victims and were surprisingly 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.310
 strong and prolific and attempts them 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.950
 destruction with the help of a business trip in 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.590
 it's beams meters in seconds 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.690
 divided into 2 galactic federations 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.340
 still managed to collect nobody to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.530
 instances of these creatures 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 need to put your headquarters for 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 further study failed 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.459
 since on the way they were attacked 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.799
 space pirates abduct 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.950
 metro and took them to their planet 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.650
 service though later were created 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.510
 whole squad or troika 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.360
 to destroy space pirates and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.319
 eliminate the threat metroid of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.569
 galactic federation sends 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.610
 bounty hunter samus aran 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.560
 and she did an excellent job after 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.489
 supreme council gave samus a new task 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.790
 fly to the planet roger 388 wipe off 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.680
 the faces of the metro galaxy as a view of the ester 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.859
 388 everything turned out 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.629
 worse than you could imagine 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.670
 mitrandir became more developed and were 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.370
 able to grow even stronger 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.349
 creatures but also here the most gusto hot 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.190
 to overcome all the difficulty to defeat the queen 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.470
 and trinity after the death of the queen or he 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.500
 found an egg that was laying right 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.930
 in front of her and she could not find in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.109
 imagine the power to destroy the last larva 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.370
 the womb she delivered the larva to the academy 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.739
 to chemical sciences 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.489
 where scientists could learn the features 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.670
 of this living organism after a while 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.669
 when it would seem the world restored Samus 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.190
 got an alarm 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:38.290
 urgently return to the Academy of Sciences when 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.750
 she returned to the research center then 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.120
 detected station captured in topic 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.040
 by the cosmic pirates themselves the capital 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.110
 record and their leader ready 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.769
 stole the Mettid and took with him to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.230
 restored base on yourself the most only 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.540
 go after them to return 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.120
 the last metiid and peace in the pirates 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.730
 once and for all from this place and 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.530
 begins a full game like this 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.140
 here is the background of super metroid 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.159
 it's dirt 16 bit games in every sense 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.560
 this word 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.889
 one thing is that the size of the card was 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.509
 241 already says a lot 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.090
 events unfold on the planet zerus 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.599
 darkly dungeons space base 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.280
 pirates 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.830
 you have to take on the role 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.460
 bounty hunter samus aran 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.770
 main character 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.539
 you will collect items and improvements 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.979
 allowing to expand the arsenal and 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.470
 character abilities 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.289
 and also giving the opportunity to further 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.990
 promotion in the game in one direction or another 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.660
 since the level design is created 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.300
 specifically for non-linear transmission 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.820
 for example upgrade jump increase or 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.610
 let's say improvement to speed to 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.659
 pour out the walls with overclocking 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.449
 the door to the game is opened by 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.689
 shots them and for each need catch 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.059
 weapon 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.779
 in the same way, you can blow up walls and 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:05.209
 ceiling for finding secrets and 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.099
 alternative paths 

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:09.629
 how wander is also subject to be average 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.809
 in order to pass 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.659
 instead with a fever you 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:17.759
 need appropriate vestments 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.989
 increased in heat-resistance and in order 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.179
 to quickly overcome 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:23.959
 do the fuel places need a suit 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:27.119
 abolishing the fear of moving on water 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:28.739
 many items are also sold in all 

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:31.739
 other games of the series 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:34.679
 like morphine floor allowing 

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:36.499
 most twisted shtar put a bomb and 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:39.629
 Extremely like Russian passages 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:42.149
 as I mentioned in the game is full 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.879
 diverse secret and ways 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:47.159
 finding these secrets are quite different 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.409
 from which there is a great desire 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:53.159
 explore each level along and 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:56.849
 across enemies are divided into 2 types of living 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:06:00.560
 organisms and huge bosses and on 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:03.330
 each boss needs their own battle tactics 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.100
 summarize in my subjective opinion this 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.320
 the game is worth every lover 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.060
 old school at least once would have tried in 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.680
 play it check 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.230
 you will not regret it 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.210
 time, the same advice to remove super 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.500
 metroid game lovers k out of swimming 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.570
 symphony of the night 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.700
 so how simple they cry 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.190
 borrowed from the metro is a concept 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.010
 Cop levels due to which appeared 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.800
 term metroidvania 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.840
 I think that's enough for me 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.480
 there is something else to tell about this game and 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.820
 other games of the meter series and if you like it 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.360
 it will be interesting I will definitely do it 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.300
 actor 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.300
 eat all the best thank you for your attention
