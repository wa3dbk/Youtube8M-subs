we<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:45.180> talked<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> event<00:00:46.110> I'm

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
we got we we talked about the event I'm

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.569 
we got we we talked about the event I'm
here<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> second<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
here for a second and this is going to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.670 
here for a second and this is going to
be<00:00:47.670> pretty<00:00:47.879> helpful<00:00:48.090> tool<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.719> believe<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
be pretty helpful tool I believe one of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.650 
be pretty helpful tool I believe one of
the<00:00:49.800> oldest<00:00:50.280> tricks<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> book<00:00:51.000> for

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the oldest tricks in the book for

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.700 
the oldest tricks in the book for
download<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> peak<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.980> 3m<00:00:53.809> conversion<00:00:54.809> was

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
download on peak the 3m conversion was

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.760 
download on peak the 3m conversion was
to<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.329> use<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.539> venom<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.500> sneak

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to actually use the venom to sneak

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.880 
to actually use the venom to sneak
through<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.640> side<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.930> can't<00:01:01.590> tell<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
through the back side I can't tell you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.799 
through the back side I can't tell you
how<00:01:02.070> many<00:01:02.129> successful<00:01:02.730> back<00:01:03.059> rages<00:01:03.480> I've<00:01:03.660> been

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
how many successful back rages I've been

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
how many successful back rages I've been
a<00:01:03.840> part<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.830> course<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.189> wasn't<00:01:05.400> flying

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a part of and of course I wasn't flying

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
a part of and of course I wasn't flying
because<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.180> can't<00:01:06.510> pilot<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.960> thing<00:01:07.020> it's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
because I can't pilot this thing it's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.950 
because I can't pilot this thing it's
basically<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> bathtub<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.430> me<00:01:08.720> flying<00:01:09.720> this

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
basically a bathtub to me flying this

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
basically a bathtub to me flying this
bad<00:01:10.320> boy<00:01:10.590> through<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.700> side<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
bad boy through the back side of the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
bad boy through the back side of the
tunnel<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.979> think<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.130> could<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> little

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
tunnel I think this could be a little

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
tunnel I think this could be a little
bit<00:01:14.820> easier<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.420> attacking<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.920> I'm

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
bit easier for attacking this and I'm

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
bit easier for attacking this and I'm
gonna<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> couple<00:01:17.700> reasons<00:01:18.000> why<00:01:18.299> if

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
gonna go over a couple reasons why if

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.410 
gonna go over a couple reasons why if
you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.009> main<00:01:20.220> tunnels<00:01:20.670> look<00:01:21.330> at

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you can get out the main tunnels look at

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
you can get out the main tunnels look at
all<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> free<00:01:22.140> space<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.220> roam

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
all this free space that we have to roam

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
all this free space that we have to roam
around<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:24.479> flank<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> left<00:01:25.409> flank

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
around right flank and left flank

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
around right flank and left flank
there's<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.700> nasty<00:01:27.119> spots<00:01:27.420> underneath<00:01:27.840> me

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
there's some nasty spots underneath me

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
there's some nasty spots underneath me
some<00:01:28.470> physics<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.159> cement-filled

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
some physics which are cement-filled

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
some physics which are cement-filled
bags<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> play<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.470> cut<00:01:32.009> down

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bags that we can play off to cut down

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.090 
bags that we can play off to cut down
the<00:01:33.000> people<00:01:33.360> pushing<00:01:33.630> through<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> middle

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the people pushing through the middle

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.749 
the people pushing through the middle
the<00:01:35.670> key<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> most<00:01:36.659> rush<00:01:37.619> max<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.159> push<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the key to most rush max is push the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.630 
the key to most rush max is push the
outside<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.079> middle<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.710> cut<00:01:40.920> down<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
outside the middle get cut down in the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
outside the middle get cut down in the
crossfire<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> nasty

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
crossfire so there is some kind of nasty

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
crossfire so there is some kind of nasty
spots<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.100> play<00:01:44.399> that'd<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.090> very

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
spots to play that'd be very

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
spots to play that'd be very
advantageous<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> attackers<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.340> take

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
advantageous of the attackers to take

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520 
advantageous of the attackers to take
it'll<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.420> pretty<00:01:48.630> tough<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> knock<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it'll be pretty tough to knock the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
it'll be pretty tough to knock the
defenders<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.970> map<00:01:51.270> will

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
defenders off but i think this map will

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.440 
defenders off but i think this map will
swing<00:01:52.369> towards<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> attacking<00:01:53.729> side<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
swing towards the attacking side for the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
swing towards the attacking side for the
most<00:01:54.659> part<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.229> let's<00:01:55.710> park<00:01:56.130> big<00:01:56.340> bertha<00:01:56.700> here

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
most part and let's park big bertha here

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
most part and let's park big bertha here
