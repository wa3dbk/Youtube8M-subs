00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 murici will speak today of murici talk may sound like the distance and after 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.210
 steal the team can win 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 the people already being able to rain today in the Fluminense and the European Union 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.880
 I did not tell you that it took too long. 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.189
 or the agent asked who does not want 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.640
 just remember that it's worth nothing like this 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.939
 in Mozambique where the student can very well 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.939
 since then 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.649
 the rest of the italy team is the following club mode 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.039
 changed status to you as it is always there at the top of the table disputing the 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.129
 title you're always there in the post-event 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.350
 maintaining that the secret of justice 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.050
 this chapter of your life and how 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.890
 after making a legal sequence that is bet it is different to forget 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.570
 this period the ijuÃ­ team 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 If you're enjoying it, continue it. 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.970
 how is a leader as it is the tradition of the murici over his 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.220
 day to day but he only has many more people 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 anastasia psdb 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 to sandra 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
 This is Flemish. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.700
 we have to work 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
 but running a hand over his head 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.460
 be the first 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.630
 the institutions 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
 This is the most important to me. 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 saw the Fluminense become Brazilian champion 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.860
 this average is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 no one knows the yellow card 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 I'm not afraid 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.510
 we have to see which only punctuation terms - they develop much less 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.020
