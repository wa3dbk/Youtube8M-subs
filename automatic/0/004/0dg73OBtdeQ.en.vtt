00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so we did a pocket poacher this was this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
so we did a pocket poacher this was this
has<00:01:15.240> gone<00:01:15.420> wrong<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.659> other<00:01:15.960> hole<00:01:16.140> drilled

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
has gone wrong this other hole drilled

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.730 
has gone wrong this other hole drilled
in<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.930> as<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> round

in it but there as you can see the round

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.780 
in it but there as you can see the round
over<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.130> there's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> greater<00:01:21.360> curve<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.990> now

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
over bit there's a greater curve for now

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
over bit there's a greater curve for now
you<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:23.909> they'll<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.240> feel<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.960> much

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you know they'll just feel so much

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.929 
you know they'll just feel so much
better<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> end<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.430> little

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
better in the end there's little

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.280 
better in the end there's little
difference<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.689> makes<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
difference like that makes all the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
difference like that makes all the
difference<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> ask<00:01:28.979> me<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> see

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
difference if you ask me as you can see

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.920 
difference if you ask me as you can see
squared<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> bit<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.320> nicely<00:01:32.189> rounded

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
squared off a bit there nicely rounded

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.380 
squared off a bit there nicely rounded
so<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.189> nothing<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.670> sale<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> couple

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so on are nothing for sale for a couple

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
so on are nothing for sale for a couple
of<00:01:36.479> days<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.290> get<00:01:37.829> all<00:01:37.979> these<00:01:38.130> blanks

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of days but I get all these blanks

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
of days but I get all these blanks
appear<00:01:38.790> rounded<00:01:39.180> off<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> blanks

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
appear rounded off and all the blanks

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.179 
appear rounded off and all the blanks
everywhere<00:01:40.680> else<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:42.320> from<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:44.009> all

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
gonna be coming with a new round over

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.350 
gonna be coming with a new round over
bit<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:46.280> absolutely<00:01:47.280> fantastic<00:01:47.520> can't<00:01:48.210> wait

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
bit it's absolutely fantastic can't wait

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.230 
bit it's absolutely fantastic can't wait
see<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.659> finished<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.729> takes<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> ball<00:01:51.030> can

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
see I'm finished a takes the ball can

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
see I'm finished a takes the ball can
set<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> catapult<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> actual<00:01:52.470> feel<00:01:52.710> he's

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
set the catapult in the actual feel he's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.609 
set the catapult in the actual feel he's
you<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.729> ten<00:01:53.939> times<00:01:54.119> better<00:01:54.390> than<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
you know it's ten times better than the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.209 
you know it's ten times better than the
bulkier<00:01:56.009> ones<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.710> just<00:01:58.710> suppose<00:01:58.860> I'd<00:01:58.979> share

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
bulkier ones so just suppose I'd share

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
bulkier ones so just suppose I'd share
that<00:01:59.250> VF<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.969> won't<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.570> something<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that VF and I won't be something for a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.010 
that VF and I won't be something for a
couple<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.350> days<00:02:01.500> now

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
couple of days now

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.410 
couple of days now
due<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.500> getting<00:02:03.770> all<00:02:03.890> these<00:02:04.040> don't<00:02:04.670> also

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420
