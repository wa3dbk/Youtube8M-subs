only thing I did have to do after I had
to<00:05:16.289> put<00:05:16.469> on<00:05:16.589> I<00:05:17.159> did<00:05:17.909> have<00:05:18.059> to<00:05:18.179> add<00:05:18.360> here<00:05:18.389> a

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
to put on I did have to add here a

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.389 
to put on I did have to add here a
little<00:05:18.869> spring<00:05:19.969> see<00:05:20.969> it<00:05:21.029> or<00:05:21.179> not<00:05:21.360> right<00:05:21.899> here

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:22.399 
little spring see it or not right here

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
little spring see it or not right here
to<00:05:23.399> go<00:05:23.579> to<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:24.559> butterfly<00:05:25.909> in<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:27.059> back<00:05:27.269> of

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
to go to the butterfly in the back of

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.889 
to go to the butterfly in the back of
the<00:05:27.479> carb<00:05:27.779> here<00:05:29.329> because<00:05:30.329> there<00:05:30.599> was<00:05:30.749> not

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:30.899 
the carb here because there was not

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:36.889 
the carb here because there was not
enough<00:05:30.959> tension<00:05:31.519> to<00:05:35.059> completely<00:05:36.059> close<00:05:36.479> back

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:36.899 
enough tension to completely close back

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.799 
enough tension to completely close back
the<00:05:38.419> butterfly<00:05:39.419> mechanism<00:05:39.829> on<00:05:40.829> the

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:41.809 
the butterfly mechanism on the

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.509 
the butterfly mechanism on the
carburetor<00:05:42.809> and<00:05:43.049> it<00:05:43.379> was<00:05:43.499> causing<00:05:43.739> it<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.099> idle

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:44.519 
carburetor and it was causing it to idle

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:48.409 
carburetor and it was causing it to idle
high<00:05:44.699> and<00:05:46.579> diesel<00:05:47.579> whenever<00:05:47.909> you<00:05:48.029> would<00:05:48.149> shut

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
high and diesel whenever you would shut

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.039 
high and diesel whenever you would shut
it<00:05:48.539> off

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:49.049 
it off

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:52.369 
it off
but<00:05:49.889> that<00:05:50.579> little<00:05:50.759> spring<00:05:51.289> eliminated<00:05:52.289> that

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
but that little spring eliminated that

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.769 
but that little spring eliminated that
problem<00:05:52.439> and<00:05:53.039> also<00:05:53.759> it<00:05:53.909> stiffened<00:05:54.329> up<00:05:54.419> front

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
problem and also it stiffened up front

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:59.869 
problem and also it stiffened up front
the<00:05:55.219> gas<00:05:56.219> pedal<00:05:57.409> which<00:05:58.409> was<00:05:59.249> definitely

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
the gas pedal which was definitely

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.039 
the gas pedal which was definitely
needed<00:06:00.179> because<00:06:00.389> it<00:06:00.539> was<00:06:00.659> so<00:06:01.649> weak<00:06:02.929> when<00:06:03.929> you

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:04.049 
needed because it was so weak when you

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:06.139 
needed because it was so weak when you
press<00:06:04.319> the<00:06:04.469> gas<00:06:04.649> it<00:06:04.979> just<00:06:05.189> panted<00:06:05.579> it<00:06:06.029> was

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.149 
press the gas it just panted it was

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:07.669 
press the gas it just panted it was
ridiculous<00:06:06.659> you<00:06:06.749> could<00:06:06.899> breathe<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.289> it<00:06:07.379> go<00:06:07.649> to

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:07.679 
ridiculous you could breathe on it go to

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:12.319 
ridiculous you could breathe on it go to
the<00:06:07.829> floor<00:06:09.409> but<00:06:10.639> see<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.759> runs<00:06:11.969> good

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:12.329 
the floor but see it runs good

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:17.629 
the floor but see it runs good
tachometer<00:06:12.929> still<00:06:13.349> works<00:06:16.099> all<00:06:17.099> the<00:06:17.249> gauges

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
tachometer still works all the gauges

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:24.949 
tachometer still works all the gauges
work<00:06:21.439> like<00:06:22.439> I<00:06:22.529> said<00:06:22.769> the<00:06:23.389> carburetor<00:06:24.389> didn't

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:24.959 
work like I said the carburetor didn't

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.519 
work like I said the carburetor didn't
help<00:06:25.169> as<00:06:25.349> far<00:06:25.559> as<00:06:25.679> it<00:06:25.800> running<00:06:26.159> a<00:06:26.339> lot<00:06:26.759> better

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:27.529
