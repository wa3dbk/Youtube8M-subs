00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.790 
case when you're demonized you build up
some<00:02:31.090> gauge<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.780> when<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.260> eventually<00:02:32.470> get

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
some gauge and when you eventually get

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.729 
some gauge and when you eventually get
up<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.370> some<00:02:33.550> bonuses<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:35.050> don't<00:02:35.620> remember

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
up you get some bonuses I don't remember

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.009 
up you get some bonuses I don't remember
exactly<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.790> but<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.269> think<00:02:37.540> it's

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
exactly what it is but I think it's

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.390 
exactly what it is but I think it's
either<00:02:38.200> an<00:02:38.319> attack<00:02:38.620> boost<00:02:38.860> or<00:02:39.010> an<00:02:39.069> affinity

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
either an attack boost or an affinity

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.100 
either an attack boost or an affinity
boost<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:41.260> also<00:02:41.500> get<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.750> funky<00:02:43.750> new<00:02:43.870> Dodge

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
boost and you also get a funky new Dodge

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.270 
boost and you also get a funky new Dodge
it's<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.160> slide<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.940> yeah<00:02:46.330> crap<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.709> ran<00:02:48.160> out

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it's like slide this yeah crap I ran out

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.520 
it's like slide this yeah crap I ran out
of<00:02:48.310> stamina<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.830> pretty<00:02:54.640> cool<00:02:54.910> since<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
of stamina so it's pretty cool since the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.250 
of stamina so it's pretty cool since the
slides<00:02:57.370> at<00:02:58.299> least<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.599> my<00:02:58.720> opinion<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
slides at least in my opinion is a

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.360 
slides at least in my opinion is a
better<00:02:59.549> they'd<00:03:00.549> move<00:03:00.819> than<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.540> role<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:03.099> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
better they'd move than the role and you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.759 
better they'd move than the role and you
actually<00:03:03.489> get<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.819> slide<00:03:04.750> when<00:03:05.620> you're

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
actually get the slide when you're

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.500 
actually get the slide when you're
demonized<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.120> things<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.390> can

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
demonized so one of the things you can

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.570 
demonized so one of the things you can
actually<00:03:13.660> do<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.680> works<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:15.160> well<00:03:15.280> with

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
actually do that works really well with

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.020 
actually do that works really well with
full<00:03:16.180> swords<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.500> get<00:03:17.890> up<00:03:18.010> some<00:03:19.290> know<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
full swords is to get up some know you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.020 
full swords is to get up some know you
can<00:03:22.209> get<00:03:22.329> off<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.750> deaf<00:03:23.470> juice<00:03:23.829> mega<00:03:24.519> dash<00:03:24.730> juice

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
can get off a deaf juice mega dash juice

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.000 
can get off a deaf juice mega dash juice
and<00:03:25.299> then<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.470> will<00:03:26.560> give<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.769> infinite

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
and then that will give you infinite

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.789 
and then that will give you infinite
stamina<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:28.470> since<00:03:30.359> demon<00:03:31.359> mode<00:03:31.709> gives<00:03:32.709> you

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
stamina and since demon mode gives you

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.309 
stamina and since demon mode gives you
the<00:03:32.920> trade-off<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.340> having<00:03:33.940> more<00:03:34.630> damage<00:03:35.019> in

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the trade-off of having more damage in

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.270 
the trade-off of having more damage in
exchange<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:36.130> draining<00:03:36.880> stamina<00:03:38.280> it's

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
exchange for draining stamina it's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.729 
exchange for draining stamina it's
actually<00:03:39.609> really<00:03:39.730> great<00:03:40.000> since<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.380> can<00:03:41.560> use

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
actually really great since you can use

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.940 
actually really great since you can use
the<00:03:42.389> dash<00:03:43.389> juice<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:44.260> negate<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> stamina

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
the dash juice to negate the stamina

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.710 
the dash juice to negate the stamina
loss<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:45.549> there's<00:03:45.730> not<00:03:45.910> really<00:03:46.120> as<00:03:46.299> much<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.660> a

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
loss so there's not really as much of a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.370 
loss so there's not really as much of a
detriment<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.560> using<00:03:48.310> demonization<00:03:48.700> mood<00:03:49.380> all

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
detriment to using demonization mood all

00:03:50.380 --> 00:04:04.449 
detriment to using demonization mood all
rights<00:03:50.620> second<00:03:51.010> paralysis<00:03:51.430> let<00:03:52.090> us<00:03:52.329> go<00:03:52.600> crazy

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.880 

one<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.060> combo<00:04:06.870> changes<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.709> might

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
one of the combo changes you might

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.690 
one of the combo changes you might
notice<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:09.680> when<00:04:10.680> you're<00:04:10.830> demonized<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.520> get

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
notice is when you're demonized you get

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.039 
notice is when you're demonized you get
this<00:04:11.820> crazy<00:04:12.660> look<00:04:12.870> sort<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.260> dance<00:04:14.160> move<00:04:15.049> it's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
this crazy look sort of dance move it's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.390 
this crazy look sort of dance move it's
called<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.410> demon<00:04:16.950> dance<00:04:18.680> go<00:04:19.680> away<00:04:19.769> legume<00:04:20.160> be

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.280 

married<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:24.710> that's<00:04:25.710> your<00:04:25.860> ex<00:04:26.070> plus<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.580> attack

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
married and that's your ex plus a attack

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.670 
married and that's your ex plus a attack
outside<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.590> diva<00:04:28.800> mode<00:04:29.010> it's<00:04:29.240> sort<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.419> a

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
outside of diva mode it's sort of like a

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.890 
outside of diva mode it's sort of like a
forward-moving<00:04:32.060> thrust<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.830> crap<00:04:34.830> i<00:04:35.040> should

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
forward-moving thrust and crap i should

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.050 
forward-moving thrust and crap i should
have<00:04:36.900> dodged<00:04:37.140> there<00:04:37.440> oh<00:04:37.620> well<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:41.060> when

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
have dodged there oh well and when

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.750 
have dodged there oh well and when
you're<00:04:42.150> demonized<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.680> very<00:04:44.040> long<00:04:44.280> combo

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
you're demonized it's a very long combo

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.860 
you're demonized it's a very long combo
that<00:04:45.210> deals<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.540> lot<00:04:45.570> of<00:04:45.810> damage<00:04:47.180> however<00:04:48.180> it's

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
that deals a lot of damage however it's

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.050 
that deals a lot of damage however it's
actually<00:04:49.200> not<00:04:49.320> one<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.950> best<00:04:50.610> moves<00:04:50.820> to

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
actually not one of the best moves to

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.800 
actually not one of the best moves to
build<00:04:51.240> up<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.840> deem<00:04:52.050> engage<00:04:52.669> either<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.940> X<00:04:54.419> or

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
build up you deem engage either the X or

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.870 
build up you deem engage either the X or
the<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.930> combo<00:04:55.500> works<00:04:56.220> much<00:04:56.520> better<00:04:56.550> than

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
the a combo works much better than

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.870 
the a combo works much better than
getting<00:04:57.180> up<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.480> meter<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:58.820> generally<00:04:59.820> prefer

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
getting up that meter I generally prefer

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.230 
getting up that meter I generally prefer
using<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.900> combo<00:05:01.710> since<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:02.430> faster

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
using that a a combo since that's faster

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.130 
using that a a combo since that's faster
it<00:05:04.140> has<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.290> little<00:05:04.560> better<00:05:04.770> reach<00:05:05.090> but<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.990> can

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
it has a little better reach but you can

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.080 
it has a little better reach but you can
use<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.410> x<00:05:07.500> combo<00:05:07.830> if<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.010> like<00:05:08.220> it's<00:05:08.850> up<00:05:08.970> to

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
use the x combo if you like it's up to

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.440 
use the x combo if you like it's up to
you<00:05:09.180> that's<00:05:09.750> just<00:05:09.930> my<00:05:10.140> preference<00:05:11.450> right

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
you that's just my preference right

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.409 
you that's just my preference right
let's<00:05:13.229> sharpen<00:05:13.919> up<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:14.850> it<00:05:14.970> won't<00:05:15.120> have<00:05:15.270> to

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
let's sharpen up so it won't have to

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.880 
let's sharpen up so it won't have to
sharpen<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.669> middle<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.000> flight

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
sharpen in the middle of the flight

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:31.790 
sharpen in the middle of the flight
ideally<00:05:20.960> let's<00:05:21.960> go<00:05:22.080> hunt<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.500> lagaan<00:05:23.100> be<00:05:23.220> down
