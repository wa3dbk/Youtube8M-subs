suspension or maybe sometimes the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
players will bit out a form so they need

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.640 
players will bit out a form so they need
somewhere<00:01:46.420> for<00:01:46.480> these<00:01:46.659> players<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:46.990> go<00:01:47.260> so<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
somewhere for these players to go so the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.500 
somewhere for these players to go so the
ESL<00:01:47.890> pals<00:01:48.100> cup<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.520> great<00:01:48.760> area<00:01:48.940> for<00:01:49.090> them<00:01:49.360> to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
ESL pals cup is a great area for them to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.560 
ESL pals cup is a great area for them to
gather<00:01:50.409> their<00:01:50.680> thoughts<00:01:50.830> again<00:01:51.480> and<00:01:52.480> get

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
gather their thoughts again and get

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.290 
gather their thoughts again and get
themselves<00:01:52.690> back<00:01:52.960> into<00:01:53.940> well<00:01:54.940> we're<00:01:55.090> not<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
themselves back into well we're not the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.170 
themselves back into well we're not the
speed<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.690> an<00:01:55.780> NRL<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:57.190> body<00:01:57.400> contact<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:57.970> just

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
speed of an NRL the body contact is just

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.460 
speed of an NRL the body contact is just
the<00:01:58.270> same<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.690> it<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:58.930> gives<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.290> guys<00:01:59.440> a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
the same so it just gives the guys a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.410 
the same so it just gives the guys a
chance<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.979> get<00:02:00.070> their<00:02:00.190> timing<00:02:00.610> right<00:02:00.760> with<00:02:01.390> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
chance to get their timing right with a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.719 
chance to get their timing right with a
confidence<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.070> we're<00:02:03.159> kind<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.370> dust<00:02:03.610> them

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
confidence so we're kind of dust them

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.090 
confidence so we're kind of dust them
off<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.909> little<00:02:04.000> bit<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.330> send<00:02:05.260> them<00:02:05.380> back<00:02:05.440> but

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
off a little bit and send them back but

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.170 
off a little bit and send them back but
the<00:02:06.190> good<00:02:06.400> thing<00:02:06.430> is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
the good thing is

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.270 
the good thing is
the<00:02:07.960> players<00:02:08.200> coming<00:02:08.530> through<00:02:08.649> our<00:02:08.830> junior

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the players coming through our junior

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.830 
the players coming through our junior
ranks<00:02:09.820> get<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.060> chance<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.479> play<00:02:10.509> with<00:02:10.780> these

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
ranks get a chance to play with these

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.770 
ranks get a chance to play with these
NRL<00:02:11.230> players<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.210> think<00:02:13.390> that's<00:02:13.570> what

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
NRL players and and I think that's what

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.320 
NRL players and and I think that's what
this<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.710> under-20s<00:02:15.220> missing<00:02:16.000> out<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> little

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
this the under-20s missing out a little

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.460 
this the under-20s missing out a little
bit<00:02:16.480> because<00:02:16.630> they're<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:16.930> getting<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.290> top

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
bit because they're not getting the top

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.230 
bit because they're not getting the top
quality<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:17.950> our<00:02:18.040> real<00:02:18.220> players<00:02:18.430> coming<00:02:19.060> back

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
quality in our real players coming back

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.460 
quality in our real players coming back
to<00:02:19.360> help<00:02:19.450> them<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:20.020> will<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.200> too

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
to help them because there will be too

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.500 
to help them because there will be too
old<00:02:20.650> but<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:21.790> New<00:02:21.850> South<00:02:22.000> Wales<00:02:22.060> cup<00:02:22.390> it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
old but for New South Wales cup it's

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.840 
old but for New South Wales cup it's
perfect<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:23.980> that's<00:02:24.130> why<00:02:24.400> we're<00:02:24.730> as

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
perfect so I think that's why we're as

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.270 
perfect so I think that's why we're as
strong<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.720> are<00:02:25.870> now<00:02:26.140> probably<00:02:26.980> didn't

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
strong as we are now probably didn't

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.530 
strong as we are now probably didn't
before<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.060> commitment<00:02:28.450> from

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
before because of the commitment from

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.120 
before because of the commitment from
the<00:02:28.660> NRL<00:02:28.959> time<00:02:29.170> sending<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.530> quality<00:02:29.920> players

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
the NRL time sending the quality players

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.430 
the NRL time sending the quality players
