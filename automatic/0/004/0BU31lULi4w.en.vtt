some<00:00:00.179> of<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.329> uncertainties<00:00:00.989> that<00:00:01.319> have<00:00:01.770> been

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
some of the uncertainties that have been

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.400 
some of the uncertainties that have been
a<00:00:02.419> that<00:00:03.419> have<00:00:03.540> been<00:00:03.629> hurting<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.049> markets

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
a that have been hurting the markets

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.170 
a that have been hurting the markets
particularly<00:00:04.830> Greece<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.310> China<00:00:05.520> those

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
particularly Greece in China those

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.270 
particularly Greece in China those
uncertainties<00:00:06.540> have<00:00:07.080> been<00:00:07.290> lifted<00:00:07.740> somewhat

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
uncertainties have been lifted somewhat

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.879 
uncertainties have been lifted somewhat
and<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.389> justification<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.380> gold<00:00:10.559> going

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
and that is justification for gold going

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.669 
and that is justification for gold going
down<00:00:11.070> but<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> flash<00:00:11.700> crash<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.420> saw

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
down but the flash crash that we saw

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.070 
down but the flash crash that we saw
overnight<00:00:13.940> you<00:00:14.940> know<00:00:15.059> probably<00:00:15.330> has<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> lot<00:00:15.929> to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
overnight you know probably has a lot to

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
overnight you know probably has a lot to
do<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.260> liquidity<00:00:16.590> as<00:00:17.010> well<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.430> a

do with liquidity as well it's a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.109 
do with liquidity as well it's a
combination<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.770> stronger<00:00:19.770> dollar<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.910> fact

that the geopolitical risks in the world

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.179 
that the geopolitical risks in the world
haven't<00:00:24.269> been<00:00:24.480> severe<00:00:25.320> enough<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.769> push<00:00:26.010> the

we're<00:00:39.750> still<00:00:39.960> looking<00:00:40.489> for<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> market<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we're still looking for the market to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.229 
we're still looking for the market to
recover<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> say<00:00:44.040> over<00:00:44.340> 1100<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
recover back over and say over 1100 and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
recover back over and say over 1100 and
any<00:00:45.450> below<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.980> relatively

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
any below there to be relatively

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
any below there to be relatively
temporary<00:00:48.030> gold<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.050> tied<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.500> what

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
temporary gold is really tied to what

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.020 
temporary gold is really tied to what
the<00:00:49.739> Fed<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.760> when<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the Fed is going to do and when it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
the Fed is going to do and when it's
going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> hike<00:00:51.390> its<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.870> make<00:00:52.590> his<00:00:52.710> first

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
going to hike its for make his first

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
going to hike its for make his first
rate<00:00:53.190> hike<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.210> directionally

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
rate hike so I think directionally

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
rate hike so I think directionally
speaking<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.620> why<00:00:55.829> gold<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
speaking that's why gold is out of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.860 
speaking that's why gold is out of
favors<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:58.230> investors<00:00:58.710> 1100<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
favors with with investors 1100 is a

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
favors with with investors 1100 is a
good<00:01:00.870> support<00:01:01.289> level<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> guess<00:01:02.100> once

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
good support level but I guess once

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
good support level but I guess once
expectations<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.420> cemented<00:01:03.930> around<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
expectations are cemented around the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
expectations are cemented around the
timing<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> first<00:01:05.129> rate<00:01:05.909> hike<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.390> there's

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
timing of first rate hike and there's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
timing of first rate hike and there's
still<00:01:07.200> some<00:01:07.409> uncertainty<00:01:07.590> around<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
still some uncertainty around that and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.399 
still some uncertainty around that and
we're<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> test<00:01:09.600> below<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
we're going to test below that and I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.660 
we're going to test below that and I
think<00:01:10.650> we're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> eventually<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
think we're going to eventually get to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
think we're going to eventually get to
the<00:01:11.790> psychological<00:01:12.510> level<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> thousand

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the psychological level of a thousand

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.289 
the psychological level of a thousand
dollars<00:01:13.740> an<00:01:13.890> ounce<00:01:14.010> we've<00:01:14.520> seen<00:01:14.760> probably<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
dollars an ounce we've seen probably a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
dollars an ounce we've seen probably a
low<00:01:15.659> point<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:17.009> some

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
low point here and there will be some

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.249 
low point here and there will be some
accumulation<00:01:17.880> goals<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.330> these<00:01:18.450> lower<00:01:18.659> prices

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
accumulation goals at these lower prices

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
accumulation goals at these lower prices
to<00:01:19.590> help<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.130> companies<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to help some of these companies out that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.429 
to help some of these companies out that
are<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> miners<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.049> things<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.409> just

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
are the miners and things that are just

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
are the miners and things that are just
getting<00:01:22.710> slaughtered<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.030> forward

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
getting slaughtered as we go forward

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
getting slaughtered as we go forward
here<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> point<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.860> time

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
here so at that point I think it's time

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.440 
here so at that point I think it's time
to<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> buyer<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> think

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to want to be a buyer because I think

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.090 
to want to be a buyer because I think
it's<00:01:27.659> good<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.990> good<00:01:28.200> hard<00:01:28.409> asset<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> whole

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's good a good hard asset the whole

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
it's good a good hard asset the whole
sentiment<00:01:29.729> especially<00:01:30.360> among<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
sentiment especially among the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
sentiment especially among the
institutional<00:01:31.229> investors<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.920> started

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
institutional investors as we started

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
institutional investors as we started
off<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.640> been<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.150> negative<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.780> that's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
off has been very negative and that's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
off has been very negative and that's
going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> weigh<00:01:34.350> heavy<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.710> gold<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.000> Alex

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
going to weigh heavy on gold but as Alex

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.200 
going to weigh heavy on gold but as Alex
was<00:01:36.570> bringing<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.290> its<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> supply<00:01:38.880> that's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
was bringing up its the supply that's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.399
