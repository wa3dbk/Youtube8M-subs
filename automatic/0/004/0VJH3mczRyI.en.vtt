00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I could do that again you'll make a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.729 
I could do that again you'll make a
background<00:02:08.700> paper<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.300> wanted<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.840> it's

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
background paper if I wanted to it's

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
background paper if I wanted to it's
just<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.069> lot<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.730> isn't<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:11.970> pretty

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
just a lot you can do isn't that pretty

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.339 
just a lot you can do isn't that pretty
I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.989> even

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
I think I even

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.649 
I think I even
stamp<00:02:13.650> off<00:02:13.859> look<00:02:14.609> better<00:02:14.909> than<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.209> actual

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
stamp off look better than the actual

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.890 
stamp off look better than the actual
first<00:02:16.469> generation<00:02:16.950> stamping<00:02:17.659> now<00:02:18.659> there<00:02:18.780> was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
first generation stamping now there was

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.209 
first generation stamping now there was
one<00:02:19.170> other<00:02:19.349> thing<00:02:19.439> I<00:02:19.650> want<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.859> try<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.189> I

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
one other thing I want to try and I

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.099 
one other thing I want to try and I
didn't<00:02:20.459> try<00:02:20.639> it<00:02:20.700> last<00:02:20.999> time<00:02:21.269> that's<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:21.930> pretty

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109

this is gonna work with black cardstock
and<00:02:31.079> I<00:02:31.139> did<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.409> try<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:31.769> that's<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and I did not try that so that's the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
and I did not try that so that's the
first<00:02:32.250> generation<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.269> my<00:02:33.629> Volokh<00:02:34.079> that

see oh boy oh yeah I'm just gonna throw
in<00:03:05.069> my<00:03:05.219> colors<00:03:05.579> um<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:06.599> think<00:03:06.900> I'll<00:03:06.959> use<00:03:06.989> maybe<00:03:07.349> a

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
in my colors um I think I'll use maybe a

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.229 
in my colors um I think I'll use maybe a
lighter<00:03:07.680> pink<00:03:07.980> because<00:03:08.219> lighter<00:03:08.669> colors<00:03:09.060> tend

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
lighter pink because lighter colors tend

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.970 
lighter pink because lighter colors tend
to<00:03:09.329> be<00:03:09.449> more<00:03:09.659> opaque<00:03:09.959> they've<00:03:10.260> got<00:03:10.439> more<00:03:10.650> white

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
to be more opaque they've got more white

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.140 
to be more opaque they've got more white
in<00:03:11.280> them<00:03:11.629> more<00:03:12.629> shock<00:03:13.019> in<00:03:13.760> them<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:14.909> they'll<00:03:15.060> be

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
in them more shock in them so they'll be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.030 
in them more shock in them so they'll be
more<00:03:15.180> opaque<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.199> will<00:03:16.379> just<00:03:16.530> stick

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
more opaque so I think I will just stick

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.189 
more opaque so I think I will just stick
to<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.250> lighter<00:03:17.400> colors<00:03:17.790> here<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.419> we'll<00:03:19.049> see

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
to the lighter colors here and we'll see

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.619 
to the lighter colors here and we'll see
how<00:03:19.319> this<00:03:19.500> goes<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:20.159> black<00:03:20.579> oh<00:03:20.849> if<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.419> have

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
how this goes on black oh if you have

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.409 
how this goes on black oh if you have
any<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.900> those<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.349> metallic<00:03:23.009> chalks<00:03:23.849> they

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
any of those on metallic chalks they

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.330 
any of those on metallic chalks they
would<00:03:24.659> be<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:25.049> pretty<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.949> dark<00:03:26.129> cuz

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
would be really pretty on the dark cuz

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.399 
would be really pretty on the dark cuz
they<00:03:26.489> would<00:03:26.669> be<00:03:26.790> very<00:03:27.030> opaque<00:03:27.299> all<00:03:27.930> right<00:03:28.229> so

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
they would be very opaque all right so

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.990 
they would be very opaque all right so
I'm<00:03:28.530> gonna<00:03:28.650> stamp<00:03:29.009> that<00:03:29.220> we'll<00:03:29.489> see<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:29.939> don't

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
I'm gonna stamp that we'll see I don't

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.369 
I'm gonna stamp that we'll see I don't
know<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.329> this<00:03:30.449> is<00:03:30.569> going<00:03:30.659> to<00:03:30.720> work<00:03:30.780> or<00:03:31.049> not<00:03:31.079> so

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
know if this is going to work or not so

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.719 
know if this is going to work or not so
we're<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.829> gonna<00:03:31.979> see<00:03:32.340> here<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:34.290> let<00:03:35.250> me<00:03:35.340> hit

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
we're just gonna see here and let me hit

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.399 
we're just gonna see here and let me hit
that<00:03:35.909> with<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> heat<00:03:36.329> gun<00:03:36.359> dry<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.079> let's<00:03:37.229> see

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
that with the heat gun dry and let's see

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.659 
that with the heat gun dry and let's see
we<00:03:37.530> won't<00:03:37.739> really<00:03:37.889> be<00:03:38.099> able<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.280> tell<00:03:38.459> once

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
we won't really be able to tell once

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.890 
we won't really be able to tell once
it's<00:03:38.790> dry<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:40.970> think<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> lighter<00:03:42.299> colors<00:03:42.659> will

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
it's dry I think the lighter colors will

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.390 
it's dry I think the lighter colors will
show<00:03:43.079> up<00:03:43.169> in<00:03:43.259> the<00:03:43.319> darker<00:03:43.590> colors<00:03:43.889> well<00:03:44.129> that's

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
show up in the darker colors well that's

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.220 
show up in the darker colors well that's
my<00:03:44.609> uh<00:03:44.639> that's<00:03:45.629> my<00:03:45.900> guess

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.110 

you<00:03:50.830> could<00:03:50.980> see<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.310> starting<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.909> lighter

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
you could see it starting the lighter

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.339 
you could see it starting the lighter
colors<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.599> starting<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.930> show

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
colors and starting to show

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.820 
colors and starting to show
oh<00:03:53.379> this<00:03:53.680> showing<00:03:53.920> up<00:03:54.129> pretty<00:03:54.280> well

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.010 

all<00:03:59.790> right<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> think<00:04:00.150> that's<00:04:00.300> almost<00:04:00.690> dry<00:04:00.960> away

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
all right I think that's almost dry away

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.230 
all right I think that's almost dry away
um<00:04:01.710> so<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.130> can<00:04:02.250> see<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.640> pink<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.180> a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
um so you can see that the pink and a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.930 
um so you can see that the pink and a
lavender<00:04:03.660> shut<00:04:04.020> up<00:04:04.140> really<00:04:04.380> well<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
lavender shut up really well and the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.580 
lavender shut up really well and the
bright<00:04:05.940> green<00:04:06.120> showed<00:04:06.450> up<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:07.050> purple<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
bright green showed up that purple the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.930 
bright green showed up that purple the
dark<00:04:07.770> purple<00:04:07.920> didn't<00:04:08.280> show<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.460> so<00:04:08.490> well<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:08.910> I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
dark purple didn't show up so well but I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.450 
dark purple didn't show up so well but I
think<00:04:09.240> it's<00:04:09.360> still<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:10.080> pretty<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.530> think

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
think it's still really pretty and think

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.360 
think it's still really pretty and think
about<00:04:11.700> how<00:04:11.940> much<00:04:12.060> chalk<00:04:12.420> ink<00:04:12.690> pads<00:04:12.930> cost<00:04:13.370> you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
about how much chalk ink pads cost you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.060 
about how much chalk ink pads cost you
pay<00:04:14.550> five<00:04:14.850> or<00:04:14.880> six<00:04:15.270> seven<00:04:15.450> dollars<00:04:15.780> for<00:04:15.810> one<00:04:16.350> so

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
pay five or six seven dollars for one so

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.770 
pay five or six seven dollars for one so
if<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.250> need<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> set<00:04:17.790> it's<00:04:18.269> gonna<00:04:18.420> be<00:04:18.600> big

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
if you need a set it's gonna be big

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.590 
if you need a set it's gonna be big
bucks<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.440> like<00:04:19.470> having<00:04:19.680> 48<00:04:20.459> chalk<00:04:21.359> ink

bucks this is like having 48 chalk ink

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.510
