00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.180
 as the power of god jesus in the holy spirit 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.740
 with one person if the bible the sector 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 so that the tall individual most of the time 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.809
 How does that person stay? 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.359
 really 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.679
 god the father jesus christ holy spirit are not in a single person there is a 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.439
 March 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.579
 I have my call modalism knows realism 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.529
 who taught that there is the only being of the activity 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.910
 and that he appeared 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.010
 as father 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.420
 at the moment of history 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.859
 later he appeared as son another moment in history and then appeared 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.950
 as holy spirit 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.420
 this theory followed by some religious groups is totally flawed 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 by the following 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.950
 god is a success 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.360
 that appeared during the story 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.420
 in three different ways 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.510
 how do we suppose for example that jesus lived 11 7 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.490
 was looking at himself 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.680
 saucer said so luli stays my father the now they use to dismiss before 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.010
 there was world 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.310
 joÃ£o 17 5 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.000
 already thought if the crisis was praying for himself 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.650
 glorified ii 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.660
 I myself with the glory that I took stage with me before there is this 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.400
 myth would be absurd 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.770
 so the bible mentions so the three persons dignity are people 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.190
 different 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.409
 now deuteronomy 6d only 4 states that there is only one god 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 not in the sense 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.540
 numeric 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.870
 but in the sense of 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 nor the true something true only god 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.040
 composed of three persons some dignity dignity composed of three 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.660
 people 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.910
 it's a show 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.869
 in power in the proposed but different plan character 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.329
 and personality read for example baptism of christ and mateus 3 13 to 17 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.950
 and you'll see Dad talking 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.689
 frieze being baptized 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.049
 and the holy spirit on the shoulder of crisis form of a door 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.180
 So the Bible leaves no doubt that I was really 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.490
 the three persons of the deity are distinct 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.860
 and that each has 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.230
 a different function in the plan of salvation and also in the creation of the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.770
 our planet
