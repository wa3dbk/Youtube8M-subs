00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and obviously the more you have it on

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
and obviously the more you have it on
the<00:01:12.570> heat<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> mortal<00:01:13.260> thicken<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.430> I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the heat the mortal thicken so when I'm
