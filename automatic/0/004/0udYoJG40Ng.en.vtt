00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.130
 great desire for all boys and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 detained in this fourth episode 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.460
 weekly of the weapons challenge i 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
 for those who did n't know me, they ran the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.350
 drum and agile I bring a comparison between 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.599
 two black ops tour weapons as of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.400
 usually I bring you the usual promises 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 first of all I remind those of you who 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 they still didn't know me they didn't have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.200
 never seen my video since its 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 seasonal that you really like 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.460
 mushrooms which in description found mine 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.860
 channel that you also find the numerous 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.250
 bets I've already made on mine 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 channel precisely or on the juan canal 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 I also steal a couple of seconds for you 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 thank you for the thousands of subscribers just 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 sitting on my channel 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.370
 having said this, I also warn you of the fact 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 that I recorded the clips on two 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 several platforms will explain some 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.719
 later because he had to register them on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.609
 xbox 360 to 3 on pc so don't mind 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.199
 as much to the quality of the images and the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.700
 gameplay more than anything else mind the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.500
 comment on the data that will provide you in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030
 this episode 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 lastly, remember to leave a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.909
 comment that I wrote the weapons and the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.280
 challenges you want to see in the next ones 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.439
 episodes as for those of you still 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.900
 did not know it is you who choose the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.850
 continuation of the series we put from 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.409
 then the pleasantries start and we move on to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.000
 comparison because of the two weapons 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.530
 as you can see another time it is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840
 renewed the graphic this time I have 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.880
 got the data from the one who probably 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 will be in description on the one hand we have 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.770
 the new peace keeper of them 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 revolution just obtained from 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.720
 holders of parking 60 and soon also up 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.100
 ps3 and pc 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.049
 on the other hand we have a weapon of the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.140
 same category called scorpion vo 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.880
 as you see from the table the damage of 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.799
 two weapons and identical even if the peace 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.780
 keeper has a slight reach 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.820
 major then wins as for the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 garden damage is carried for accuracy 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.450
 the peace keeper wins while by number 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 of strokes per minute and amplitude of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.900
 charger says the black scraper 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.340
 both weapons belong to the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.810
 saab machine category 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.910
 so they are two light weapons and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.740
 manageable that will allow us a 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.510
 wide speed of movement 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.240
 identical as regards both 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.800
 let us therefore go on to analyze one 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.920
 of the main features of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.530
 these two weapons the recoil starting from 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.540
 close range let's see what happens though 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.030
 being in fact the burst of peace 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.470
 keeper slower and less prolonged the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
 two bursts of shots really are 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.910
 identical with regards to the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.280
 mid range we see the opposite phenomenon 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 so even the skull was not 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.450
 will be able to download all the shots on 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.060
 test wall while you skipper will have one 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.680
 burst quite accurate both 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.390
 weapons have a lot of recharge time 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.280
 limited to full charge the peace 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.520
 keeper takes two seconds to reload 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.770
 while the shoes I have 1.90 seconds with 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.750
 whose very short time in charger 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.030
 instead empty then a little research 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.860
 longer for the peace keeper 2.25 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.110
 seconds while I call for the scorpion 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.810
 2.52 so a big gap from the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.830
 full board charger charger 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.900
 using the charger accessory 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.520
 fast recharge time of 1.10 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.060
 seconds for both weapons a 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.410
 full charger while empty charger 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 1.25 seconds for the scorpion evo while 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.300
 1.50 seconds for the peace keeper 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.620
 switching to the recommended accessories mi 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.570
 I feel strongly advised a 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.950
 silencer for the snow bursts in 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.260
 how much we have all been able to ascertain 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.580
 how much this combination makes the weapon 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.500
 really very much 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.690
 I would also recommend a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.550
 handle as the recoil of co 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.800
 star but really absurd seen of 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.910
 counter the effectiveness of the weapon for 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.100
 as for all the others 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.570
 features 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.160
 as regards the peace keeper who 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.320
 I don't know much about it yet 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.120
 I recommend a long barrel to go to 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.680
 change those two features 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.480
 which the worst weapon then damage is 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 scope or more simply a 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.770
 silencer both obviously not 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.630
 be identified on the map yes because 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.860
 in my multiplayer experience I have 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.400
 could see how strong it is 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.440
 this weapon with this finished accessory 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.390
 the objective discourse on these two weapons 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.190
 let's sum up let's see what they are 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.270
 my experiences my opinions 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.650
 personal advice scorpion evo x 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.030
 more experienced players who know 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.440
 better control the aim e 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.239
 take advantage of those few shots in the 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.820
 loader proportionate to a frequency of 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.959
 fire so high in regards to 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.490
 instead the peacemaker 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.110
 I believe it is a weapon suitable for all 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.120
 styles of play and at all levels of 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.310
 game that if a weapon strong enough but 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.860
 not too strong very similar to a ter 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.960
 21 dmv two in my opinion both for the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.880
 playability both for the feeling with 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.210
 the weapon that can be found only by finding 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.110
 the first- person note 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.419
 having said that you can easily 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.250
 to note that I prefer the peacemaker 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.440
 but this is only because it has no level 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.030
 high game maybe some of you can 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.380
 to better appreciate the scorpion vo in 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.419
 how much can you handle the best 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.470
 start the media so let me know 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.870
 with a comment 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.450
 and don't tell me which one you think is the weapon 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.220
 best 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.780
 I greet you and thank you again for 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.610
 the thousand subscribers obtained on my channel 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.530
 I invite you to go through my channel 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.180
 careful found a description a chalk 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.680
 for the umpteenth time equals for 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.660
 the opportunity it is offering me is 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.860
 nothing we see the next challenge e 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.860
 pebbles and in the field
