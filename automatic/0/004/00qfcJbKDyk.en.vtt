00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.670
 this time we are going to make a 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.320
 fruit cocktail gelatin for is a 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.660
 gelatin very simple and very easy to make 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.900
 let's occupy a cocktail can of 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.780
 fruits we are going to occupy four envelopes of 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.670
 jelly 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.920
 a cup of normal milk 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.260
 a cup of evaporated milk or whatever it is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 equal to a can of evaporated milk and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 a can of condensed milk 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 and we are going to occupy a cup of water 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.690
 hot as a first step let's take 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.230
 the milk to a container to put them 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.230
 to warm up 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.690
 what is evaporated milk 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.660
 and the normal milk house 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.810
 once our milk is well 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.970
 hot what we are going to do is 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.830
 remove it from the fire and take it to a bowl 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 since we have it in the bowl what we're going 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.710
 to do is place or add the milk 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.710
 condensed 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.009
 with the sight of a globe or a spoon 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.810
 you will mix perfectly until 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.020
 incorporated remaining milk with milk 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020
 condensed 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 in the hot water cup you go to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.170
 add the 4 envelopes of grenetina 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.580
 once you added them with the help 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.440
 of a spoon you will try to dissolve 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.530
 everything completely 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.530
 to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.510
 once in was incorporated the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.820
 grenetina completely 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.560
 let's go back to the milk mixture 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.880
 what we had done 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880
 and we are going to incorporate 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.160
 the little by little 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.570
 one 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.570
 let's go showing 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.490
 once we mix completely and we 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.380
 there is only one mixture what we are going to 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.380
 do is add the cut of fruits 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.620
 and let's mix gently 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.080
 since we have a single mix now what 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.960
 what we are going to do is take it to a mold 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.640
 in which we are going to refrigerate it since 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.080
 we put it in the refractory now the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.030
 We will take to refrigerate 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.620
 about two hours or two hours and 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.150
 mean once they freeze and what they 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.890
 you have to do is unmold the passed 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.420
 two and a half hours that we unmold 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.010
 we stayed this way now we just 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.600
 It is good to decorate to decorate 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.460
 just add some cubes of 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 jelly for which I had colors 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.570
 this add red and color 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.130
 yellow and then but you can decorate it 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.720
 the way you like it since you 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.880
 you can give the touch that you like 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.740
 Well, I hope you're encouraged to do it 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.720
 that you vote that you comment that you subscribe 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.290
 apart from that it is a very very jelly 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.120
 easy to do is economical it's fast and 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.550
 well, the fruit is inside 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.990
 I hope you like it and then I'm going 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.990
 I'm going to leave so you can see how it looks 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.459
 since heading in this way as 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.349
 you can see it has the fruit inside and 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.000
 is this way, I hope that 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.380
 we have to make it that you turn around 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.360
 that you subscribe and see you in the 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.720
 next tutorial that I hope it's

 soon
