00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.690
 today we have another one of kathmandú do 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.510
 bibei good guys this time they 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.509
 I brought a re looked a bit strange because 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.099
 it could be called a mode but they are p 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.080
 that can be found in google place 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.750
 thor if this time we are talking 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.430
 of mcp master is an application that 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.460
 allows to edit weapon in graphic edition 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.260
 As tumaini style items will be like 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.150
 style too many things we are going to give you the 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.309
 application to which we have it will be in 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.680
 the description the application so that what 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.850
 can download so we enter the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.610
 application let us load a 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.280
 The version showed this mother 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.550
 something 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.180
 as you see on this device there are 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.460
 people that it takes a bit to enter 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.500
 but here what we would be having 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.170
 the world for example is that of clouds that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.760
 I have on the phone because we 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.739
 just entering we're going to give you this 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.260
 crystal button that is down here 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.989
 this little button is the frame of green other 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.659
 Once we give it to him and he will open what we 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.390
 they would be minecraft pocket edition bless 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.580
 this memory optimization 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.460
 full acceleration and it will change us 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.010
 what would it be to minecraft ok edition 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.150
 opening a small window that we have 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.500
 there if this window with the peak look 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.229
 because it 's the status bar to see if 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 is recording see me there we have a peak 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.020
 that would be like where we see 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.420
 where is it that they are so we get 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.140
 quickly a new advanced world 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.930
 flat 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.570
 this is a mode that gets many more 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.540
 apart but without the need for the blog if 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.120
 we remove this 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:53.070
 child girl is here and this here 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:56.730
 we lack something this now if the game and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.050
 as you can see we do not use the blogger and 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.390
 we give what would be the peak that 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.940
 can move as if it were some other 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.580
 thing to hit the peak gives us this menu 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 that gives us what it would be like to do at night 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.979
 of survival or creative day in his rival 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.490
 It has more functions because we can not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.860
 increase with this bar what would be the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.090
 flying experience make us invisible 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.650
 run and enlarge the wii that would be the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.960
 which we enter the manga but the button 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.640
 play all this gets bigger but 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.640
 as on this occasion it is already normal 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.010
 they fixed it if you were book 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.780
 we are recording because it no longer 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.430
 we need here in item add the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 new things but still I think not 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.560
 it works as much as in the version 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.110
 primeriza from here gives us the option of 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.460
 add I do not leave but it has as a 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.450
 error because when you add something 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.290
 we think a racing that says was added 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.820
 already according to was added here we can 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.830
 teleport but is not true 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.000
 what do those Andrei two teachers do 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.380
 worlds three points and if the saga 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 of the application I commented if not the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.160
 grab and if you catch them they would be very 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.230
 bastards has this crisis option 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.780
 screenshot that allows us to take a 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.840
 photo a photo of the sleeve pocket edition 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.390
 so playing outside the area where 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.280
 we have the peak when when we give 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.830
 It opens the menu when we play outside 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.140
 there it is removed we have it there as a 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.780
 messenger bubble can be said and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.910
 so let's try to see if it served us 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.240
 and he gave us the item they did not give us and 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.240
 cock 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.219
 did not give us anything then that add the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.730
 items does not work but we have that function 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:41.000
 that would be running runs more the normal 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.580
 We can not fly can not fly 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.769
 seem to have some mistakes but now 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.239
 updating you can serve and I hope 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.230

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.370
