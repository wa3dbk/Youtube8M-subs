00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.789 
seen the times today I looked yesterday
so<00:01:39.289> I<00:01:39.319> was<00:01:39.439> watching<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:41.530> yeah<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.679> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
so I was watching and yeah that the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.010 
so I was watching and yeah that the
fryer<00:01:43.069> look<00:01:43.310> quick<00:01:43.549> I<00:01:43.789> mean<00:01:44.479> there's<00:01:44.840> such<00:01:44.990> a

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
fryer look quick I mean there's such a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.450 
fryer look quick I mean there's such a
difference<00:01:45.289> in<00:01:45.590> fuel<00:01:45.860> load<00:01:46.039> I<00:01:46.069> think<00:01:46.399> you

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
difference in fuel load I think you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.010 
difference in fuel load I think you
really<00:01:46.700> do<00:01:46.819> need<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.030> look<00:01:47.270> into<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.600> times

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.240 

who<00:01:50.170> have<00:01:50.289> been<00:01:50.409> running<00:01:50.649> such<00:01:50.829> different

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
who have been running such different

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.999 
who have been running such different
fuel<00:01:51.430> those<00:01:51.579> who<00:01:52.210> knows<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.689> this<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.530> test

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
fuel those who knows and this this test

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.370 
fuel those who knows and this this test
is<00:01:54.700> not<00:01:54.969> such<00:01:55.479> an<00:01:55.600> important<00:01:55.990> one<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.200> looked

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
is not such an important one it looked

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.690 
is not such an important one it looked
for<00:01:56.560> looking<00:01:56.829> at<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.009> lap<00:01:57.130> times<00:01:57.399> I<00:01:57.549> think

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
for looking at the lap times I think

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.450 
for looking at the lap times I think
it's<00:01:58.030> important<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.380> sort<00:02:00.039> out<00:02:00.189> any<00:02:00.280> issues

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
it's important to sort out any issues

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.219 
it's important to sort out any issues
you<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.939> with<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.179> car<00:02:01.390> reliability<00:02:01.960> issues

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
you have with the car reliability issues

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.809 
you have with the car reliability issues
which<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:02.560> don't<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.829> energy<00:02:03.189> too<00:02:03.399> great<00:02:03.610> so

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
which we don't have energy too great so

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.950 
which we don't have energy too great so
far<00:02:04.030> cross<00:02:04.929> fingers<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.640> getting

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
far cross fingers and really getting

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.669 
far cross fingers and really getting
comfortable<00:02:07.960> with<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.319> car<00:02:08.500> unless

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
comfortable with in the car unless

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.529 
comfortable with in the car unless
that's<00:02:09.069> what<00:02:09.190> I've<00:02:09.310> been<00:02:09.340> doing<00:02:09.549> today<00:02:10.000> it's<00:02:10.330> a

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
hopefully when we go to harass will be a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.750 
hopefully when we go to harass will be a
lot<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.340> very<00:02:15.580> well<00:02:15.730> prepared
