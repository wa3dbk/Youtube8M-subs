00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:01.079 
you've probably seen one of these before

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.439 
you've probably seen one of these before
it's<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.860> keyless<00:00:02.220> chuck<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:03.030> it's<00:00:03.179> what<00:00:03.330> you

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
it's a keyless chuck and it's what you

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.630 
it's a keyless chuck and it's what you
use<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.629> grip<00:00:03.959> down<00:00:03.990> on<00:00:04.170> do<00:00:04.680> your<00:00:05.220> drill<00:00:05.460> bits

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
use to grip down on do your drill bits

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.940 
use to grip down on do your drill bits
or<00:00:05.910> driver<00:00:06.210> bits<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.690> with<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> drill<00:00:07.740> I

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
or driver bits with with on a drill I

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.910 
or driver bits with with on a drill I
took<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.460> off<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.970> drill<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.920> to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
took this one off of this drill here to

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.430 
took this one off of this drill here to
which<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.309> attach<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.300> propeller<00:00:12.480> directly<00:00:13.259> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
which I attach the propeller directly to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.330 
which I attach the propeller directly to
the<00:00:13.559> shaft<00:00:13.889> here<00:00:15.710> so<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.740> want<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> take<00:00:17.190> this

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the shaft here so I want to take this

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:32.290 
the shaft here so I want to take this
guy<00:00:17.490> apart<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.000> see<00:00:18.449> how<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> works

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.080 

alright<00:00:34.309> alright<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.460> I've<00:00:35.550> gotten<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> Chuck

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
alright alright so I've gotten the Chuck

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.850 
alright alright so I've gotten the Chuck
taken<00:00:36.450> apart<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.170> before<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.710> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
taken apart here but before we get to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.869 
taken apart here but before we get to
that<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> want<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.280> show<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> what's<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.670> on

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that I want to show you what's going on

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.939 
that I want to show you what's going on
on<00:00:39.000> paper<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.470> identify<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
on paper here so we can identify the

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.410 
on paper here so we can identify the
parts<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.579> take<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> apart<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.270> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
parts when we take it apart because it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.040 
parts when we take it apart because it's
a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.570> hard<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.070> we've<00:00:44.489> got<00:00:44.699> our

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
a little hard to see so we've got our

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
a little hard to see so we've got our
try<00:00:46.050> I've<00:00:46.260> sawed<00:00:46.589> down<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.129> Chuck<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
try I've sawed down the Chuck down the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.360 
try I've sawed down the Chuck down the
middle<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.540> we've<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:49.530> our<00:00:49.650> jaws<00:00:49.949> here

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
middle here and we've got our jaws here

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.770 
middle here and we've got our jaws here
they<00:00:50.519> tighten<00:00:50.850> down<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> whatever<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.629> want

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
they tighten down and whatever we want

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.970 
they tighten down and whatever we want
to<00:00:51.870> grip<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.290> which<00:00:52.650> might<00:00:52.830> be<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
to grip right here which might be a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130 
to grip right here which might be a
drill<00:00:53.280> bit<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.580> driver<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.660> something<00:00:55.019> like

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
drill bit or driver bit something like

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
drill bit or driver bit something like
that<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.010> how<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that and this is how they do that this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.850 
that and this is how they do that this
is<00:00:57.059> part<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> drill<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
is part of the drill here and then this

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.680 
is part of the drill here and then this
is<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.070> nut<00:00:59.370> which<00:00:59.610> runs<00:00:59.909> around<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> outside

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
is a nut which runs around the outside

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.329 
is a nut which runs around the outside
now<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> tighten<00:01:02.100> down<00:01:02.220> a

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
now if you think when you tighten down a

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.150 
now if you think when you tighten down a
nut<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> bolt<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.050> direction<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.739> usually

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
nut on a bolt the direction is usually

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.690 
nut on a bolt the direction is usually
down<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.149> axis<00:01:06.660> of<00:01:06.840> rotation<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.430> case

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
down the axis of rotation in this case

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870 
down the axis of rotation in this case
when<00:01:09.660> you<00:01:09.780> tighten<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.320> nut<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.460> movement

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
when you tighten this nut the movement

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.630 
when you tighten this nut the movement
of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> bolt<00:01:12.300> is<00:01:12.509> at<00:01:13.080> an<00:01:13.259> angle<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:14.160> down<00:01:14.399> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of the bolt is at an angle not down the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.330 
of the bolt is at an angle not down the
axis<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> rotation<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.440> movement<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> down

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
axis of rotation it the movement is down

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670 
axis of rotation it the movement is down
like<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.899> very

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
like this and up like this very

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
like this and up like this very
interesting<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.399> you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.940> thread

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
interesting and you can see the thread

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270 
interesting and you can see the thread
isn't<00:01:21.570> flat<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.160> an

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
isn't flat here but it's also at an

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.060 
isn't flat here but it's also at an
angle<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.869> pretty<00:01:25.080> cool<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> turn

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
angle it's pretty cool so when you turn

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.749 
angle it's pretty cool so when you turn
the<00:01:26.220> nut<00:01:26.399> these<00:01:27.210> two<00:01:27.479> jaws<00:01:27.780> move<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.830> grip

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the nut these two jaws move in and grip

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
the nut these two jaws move in and grip
whatever<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.390> between<00:01:30.690> here<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.619> let's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
whatever is in between here so now let's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
whatever is in between here so now let's
take<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:31.950> apart<00:01:33.860> we've<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:36.229> we've<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
take it apart we've got we've got the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.969 
take it apart we've got we've got the
jaws<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.979> front<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:39.619> I'm<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.860> take

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
jaws up front here and I'm going to take

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.089 
jaws up front here and I'm going to take
this<00:01:41.099> off<00:01:41.599> this<00:01:42.599> is<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.990> nut<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.410> hopefully

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
this off this is that nut and hopefully

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.249 
this off this is that nut and hopefully

is this thrust bearing right here when
you're<00:01:53.489> tightening<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.060> Chuck<00:01:54.479> you're

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you're tightening down the Chuck you're

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.979 
you're tightening down the Chuck you're
moving<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.500> jaws<00:01:55.739> that<00:01:56.459> direction<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:59.449 
moving the jaws that direction down the
slope<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.440> tighten<00:01:58.709> down<00:01:58.739> on<00:01:59.039> whatever<00:01:59.190> you're

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
slope to tighten down on whatever you're

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.130 
slope to tighten down on whatever you're
tightening<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.539> that<00:02:00.720> means<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.050> you're

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
tightening and that means that you're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.900 
tightening and that means that you're
going<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.410> force<00:02:01.739> the<00:02:01.890> opposite<00:02:02.340> direction<00:02:02.610> on

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
going to force the opposite direction on

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.089 
going to force the opposite direction on
the<00:02:03.000> nut<00:02:03.989> right<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.679> thing<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> you're

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
the nut right here the thing that you're

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.520 
the nut right here the thing that you're
tightening<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.149> thrust<00:02:06.420> bearing<00:02:06.869> helps

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
tightening so this thrust bearing helps

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
tightening so this thrust bearing helps
this<00:02:07.679> nut<00:02:07.979> move<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.729> easier<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this nut move a little easier when it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
this nut move a little easier when it
gets<00:02:09.780> under<00:02:10.020> load<00:02:10.259> I'm<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> actually

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
gets under load I'm going to actually

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.510 
gets under load I'm going to actually
pop<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.120> one<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> jaw<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
pop out one of the jaw so you can see it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:24.710 
pop out one of the jaw so you can see it
to<00:02:14.520> take<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.879> off<00:02:18.650> here<00:02:19.650> comes<00:02:22.459> done<00:02:23.720> there's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
to take this off here comes done there's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.530 
to take this off here comes done there's
the<00:02:24.930> jaw<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.030> threads<00:02:27.330> right

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the jaw so you can see the threads right

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190 
the jaw so you can see the threads right
on<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.840> there<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.450> tapered<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.989> like

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
on it there and then the tapered in like

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.900 
on it there and then the tapered in like
this<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.800> how<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> movement

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
this so this is how this is the movement

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.520 
this so this is how this is the movement
and<00:02:33.239> that's<00:02:33.390> how<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> grips<00:02:33.870> down<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.319> your

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and that's how it grips down on your

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.979 
and that's how it grips down on your
your<00:02:35.099> drill<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.239> here's<00:02:36.390> another<00:02:36.569> keyless

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
your drill bit so here's another keyless

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.599 
your drill bit so here's another keyless
chuck<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.379> one's<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> lot<00:02:37.709> bigger<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.220> has<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
chuck this one's a lot bigger it has the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.360 
chuck this one's a lot bigger it has the
same<00:02:38.790> jaws<00:02:39.090> same<00:02:39.840> action<00:02:40.260> but<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.129> has<00:02:41.250> this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
same jaws same action but this has this

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.790 
same jaws same action but this has this
cool<00:02:41.579> feature<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.969> if<00:02:42.569> you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
cool feature that if you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.470 
cool feature that if you
this<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.190> machine<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.850> your<00:02:44.270> drill<00:02:44.450> bit

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
this in your machine and your drill bit

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.120 
this in your machine and your drill bit
gets<00:02:44.780> stuck<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.410> drill<00:02:45.590> bits<00:02:45.740> going<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.950> put<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
gets stuck the drill bits going to put a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.920 
gets stuck the drill bits going to put a
big<00:02:46.340> torque<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.090> opposite<00:02:47.540> direction<00:02:47.630> of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
big torque in the opposite direction of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.550 
big torque in the opposite direction of
rotation<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.100> happens<00:02:49.460> in<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.940> case

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
rotation and what happens in this case

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.010 
rotation and what happens in this case
is<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.800> tightens<00:02:52.280> when<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.210> get<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> torque

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
is it tightens when you get a torque

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.500 
is it tightens when you get a torque
which<00:02:54.350> might<00:02:54.650> dislodge<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.490> drill<00:02:55.700> bit<00:02:55.910> it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
which might dislodge the drill bit it

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.620 
which might dislodge the drill bit it
tightens<00:02:57.500> its<00:02:57.710> grip<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.190> drill<00:02:58.490> bit<00:02:58.670> which

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
tightens its grip on the drill bit which

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.390 
tightens its grip on the drill bit which
is<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.990> pretty<00:03:00.530> cool<00:03:00.740> feature<00:03:00.800> it's<00:03:01.190> really

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
is a pretty cool feature it's really

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.870 
is a pretty cool feature it's really
smart

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
smart

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.940 
smart
here's<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.450> keyed<00:03:02.810> Chuck<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.740> use<00:03:03.920> a

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
here's a keyed Chuck you have to use a

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.010 
here's a keyed Chuck you have to use a
key<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> tighten<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.850> well<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.750> do<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.930> by

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
key to tighten it well you can do it by

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.960 
key to tighten it well you can do it by
hand<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.350> suppose<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.100> key<00:03:07.280> allows<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.850> to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
hand I suppose but the key allows you to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.480 
hand I suppose but the key allows you to
tighten<00:03:08.270> down<00:03:08.300> a<00:03:08.420> lot<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:09.680> get<00:03:09.830> more<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.280> lot

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
tighten down a lot to get more a lot

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.430 
tighten down a lot to get more a lot
more<00:03:10.550> torque<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.150> that's<00:03:11.330> because<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:12.200> gear

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
more torque and that's because the gear

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160 
more torque and that's because the gear
reduction<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.280> key<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.390> sleeve<00:03:14.720> here

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
reduction of the key to the sleeve here

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.780 
reduction of the key to the sleeve here
it's<00:03:15.560> about<00:03:15.740> three<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.550> case

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it's about three to one in this case

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
it's about three to one in this case
which<00:03:17.030> means<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.390> get<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.570> 3<00:03:17.660> times<00:03:18.170> torque

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
which means you get a 3 times torque

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.990 
which means you get a 3 times torque
advantage<00:03:18.920> from<00:03:19.070> what<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.370> you're<00:03:19.730> putting

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
advantage from what you you're putting

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.330 
advantage from what you you're putting
out<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.300> hand<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:21.140> what<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.860> caller<00:03:22.160> is

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
out of your hand to what the caller is

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.570 
out of your hand to what the caller is
putting<00:03:22.670> out<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.680> jaws<00:03:25.360> pretty<00:03:26.360> cool
