huge amount of preparation before the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.720 
huge amount of preparation before the
race<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> good<00:02:32.810> bunch<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.140> blokes<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.770> good

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
race a good bunch of blokes and good

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.040 
race a good bunch of blokes and good
teamwork<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.210> know<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.660> be<00:02:35.780> patient

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
teamwork you know and be patient

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.680 
teamwork you know and be patient
sometimes<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:38.180> know<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.390> got<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.570> know

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
sometimes you you know you got to know

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.170 
sometimes you you know you got to know
when<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> go<00:02:39.770> flow<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.400> know<00:02:40.520> when<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.760> go<00:02:40.880> fast

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
when to go flow and know when to go fast

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.490 
when to go flow and know when to go fast
and<00:02:41.450> that's<00:02:41.570> probably<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.990> hardest<00:02:42.290> thing<00:02:42.350> to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
and that's probably the hardest thing to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.340 
and that's probably the hardest thing to
learn<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:43.610> diesels<00:02:44.060> only<00:02:44.450> three<00:02:45.080> leader

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
learn the diesels only three leader

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.290 
learn the diesels only three leader
everyone<00:02:45.860> else<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.460> know<00:02:46.490> got<00:02:46.730> up<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.090> six

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
everyone else is you know got up to six

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.440 
everyone else is you know got up to six
litre<00:02:47.510> v8<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.700> new<00:02:49.850> technology

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
litre v8 so it's just the new technology

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.090 
litre v8 so it's just the new technology
that<00:02:50.480> Diesel's<00:02:50.960> coming<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.500> use<00:02:51.680> half<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
that Diesel's coming and we use half the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.530 
that Diesel's coming and we use half the
fuel<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.460> they<00:02:52.610> use<00:02:52.910> there's<00:02:53.390> less

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
fuel that they use there's less

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.600 
fuel that they use there's less
greenhouse<00:02:53.810> gases<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.620> making<00:02:54.980> diesel<00:02:55.430> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
greenhouse gases in making diesel you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.950 
greenhouse gases in making diesel you
know<00:02:55.730> we've<00:02:55.970> got<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.210> lot<00:02:56.360> more<00:02:56.510> torque<00:02:56.750> down

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
know we've got a lot more torque down

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.580 
know we've got a lot more torque down
low

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
low

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.990 
low
like<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.160> that's<00:02:58.430> where<00:02:58.670> it'll<00:02:58.820> come

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
like so that that's where it'll come

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.780 
like so that that's where it'll come
into<00:02:59.180> its<00:02:59.300> own<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.630> sand<00:02:59.870> dunes<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.790> just

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
into its own in the sand dunes it's just

00:03:01.790 --> 00:04:56.000 
into its own in the sand dunes it's just
as<00:03:01.910> it's<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.240> easy

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.710 

Australia<00:04:57.010> definitely<00:04:57.610> paces<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.360> quickest

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
Australia definitely paces the quickest

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.260 
Australia definitely paces the quickest
andhaka<00:04:59.050> all<00:04:59.860> fast<00:05:00.280> because<00:05:00.700> it<00:05:00.820> hasn't<00:05:01.060> got

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
andhaka all fast because it hasn't got

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.470 
andhaka all fast because it hasn't got
any<00:05:01.480> districtís<00:05:02.290> if<00:05:02.860> like<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> frontrunner

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
any districtís if like a frontrunner

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.960 
any districtís if like a frontrunner
doing<00:05:05.140> in<00:05:05.200> that<00:05:05.350> patient<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:05.920> know<00:05:06.490> why

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
doing in that patient that know why

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.090 
doing in that patient that know why
generally<00:05:07.330> finish<00:05:07.600> in<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.780> race<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:08.650> we<00:05:08.890> know

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
generally finish in the race so we know

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.920 
generally finish in the race so we know
the<00:05:09.340> how<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.550> pace<00:05:10.030> ourselves

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
the how to pace ourselves

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.260 
the how to pace ourselves
that's<00:05:11.500> our<00:05:11.680> probably<00:05:12.160> most<00:05:12.430> strongest<00:05:12.910> point

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
that's our probably most strongest point

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.540 
that's our probably most strongest point
because<00:05:13.810> this<00:05:13.960> is<00:05:14.140> still<00:05:14.410> brand<00:05:14.710> new<00:05:14.890> car<00:05:15.190> and

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
because this is still brand new car and

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.540 
because this is still brand new car and
they<00:05:15.970> finished<00:05:16.270> just<00:05:16.570> before<00:05:17.160> drag<00:05:18.160> will<00:05:18.370> come

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
they finished just before drag will come

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.590 
they finished just before drag will come
over<00:05:18.730> this<00:05:18.970> wife

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
over this wife

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.470 
over this wife
so<00:05:20.580> disgust<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.790> know<00:05:21.910> much<00:05:22.120> better<00:05:22.150> than

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
so disgust you know much better than

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.750 
so disgust you know much better than
dust<00:05:22.780> yet<00:05:23.050> cars<00:05:23.470> just<00:05:23.860> little<00:05:24.220> tiny<00:05:24.370> things

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
dust yet cars just little tiny things

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.950 
dust yet cars just little tiny things
you<00:05:24.940> know<00:05:25.110> final<00:05:26.110> about<00:05:27.040> their<00:05:27.390> it's<00:05:28.390> not<00:05:28.660> cars
