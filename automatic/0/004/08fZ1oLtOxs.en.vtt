00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.460
 no no no 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.420
 and more 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.039
 and how do you feel about the society that is 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.839
 is shaping between you riquelme 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.150
 I think I've always said that society 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.850
 it's been a while since I think this semester 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 places are starting to give a little 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.629
 are beginning to the results of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.070
 knowledge that was given in that mind the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.050
 past and I think that in this we are going to be able to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.550
 give a little more efficiency to those 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.010
 societies that are being created and the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 boy says in these first dates 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.809
 he knows we have to improve a lot but 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 I think putting a balance that was 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.610
 our previous to this we have changed 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.100
 we're playing a lot better 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.449
 we feel in the idea we are a little more 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.519
 protagonist inside playing field and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:11.549
 I think that's why three parties have 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:13.010
 won two is very nice recording 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.370
 people 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.540
 always motivates him to try to continue 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.150
 maintaining levels and one can in what 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.920
 possible to improve it so let's go work 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.260
 with that day to day to try to 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.550
 all parties return the affection 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.560
 of the people of the throne field game that 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.020
 I always say that the best way for 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.750
 swells and because they squeeze they resisted in your 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.920
 twitter and no more followers start from 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.659
 new 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 6 together with the people from whom we take 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.979
 that initiative to continue with 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.560
 with the message that we talked about in the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.299
 commercial and I like the idea of ​​doing it 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 I said ah apart a whole new beginning 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.259
 then what is the interior meter that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.659
 it was not good at all I said the same as 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.030
 we start again from scratch as the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.399
 first good match I started from scratch with 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 the twitter with everything from scratch to see if 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.840
 changed things also in what 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.520
 football I think the idea for now 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.960
 has been more than good and speaking of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.090
 start from scratch how was your first 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.520
 contact with the soccer ball go 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.910
 tearing 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.640
 the tiny little boy already has 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.770
 a photo where they exist in a crib in the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.620
 my old man's bed with 18 pilots 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.700
 around so imagine that it was coming 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.660
 the joy of living so that it would 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.970
 to can help 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.610
 yes brother my old my grandfather economy 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.760
 flight we come a long dynasty must of 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.230
 have played football and some goal 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.290
 important and good always mention the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.650
 of rating as the most important 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.439
 to your career but in childhood some 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.630
 goal of some time with football and that 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.790
 remember a lot 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.379
 in childhood 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.200
 do not play much in inferior 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.849
 generally the substitute did not need 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.069
 that always arrived at the end of the year 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.349
 handle free in games and told you 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.569
 new project future project that does not 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.799
 always in front always always in front of 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.530
 any power made but always 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.840
 front and well I did not have for there are many 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.519
 lower playing opportunities and 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.760
 when I had it I think I played 15 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.400
 matches in the fifth division had 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.159
 he created 11 12 goals and it would not be a reserve 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.629
 you debuted a goal and already another game already 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.220
 taste first and never 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.799
 so play fast the process of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.269
 come because come to mouth 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.030
 first because you are looking for interest to me that 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.159
 the most important thing no further than if one 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.150
 could choose to choose these two teams 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.250
 also the team has to be 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.680
 interested in one in a good one when 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.510
 came up he came up with the idea that the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.069
 possibility is not wrong I wanted to tell 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.140
 with me and coaches and badly Carlos 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.180
 bianchi could not at any time 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.310
 I think it's one of the maximum affirms 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.650
 that a player has to reach a team 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.360
 like mouth and with a carlos cano well in 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.670
 the head and to finish the fan that 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.800
 know a little outside of football to 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 the goals 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.340
 your passions we know that you like the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.490
 movie theater 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.230
 recommend 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.600
 a movie that you like a lot of 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.790
 dogs and we also see that you have many 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.060
 tattoos yes yes I like a little bit of all 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.010
 the tattoos the movies the dogs in the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.180
 Good movies usually on Thursdays 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.129
 I always go with my friends 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.269
 or with my lady my friends are going 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.120
 mixing but as is the day of 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.070
 premieres then it's good so let's go to 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.460
 cinema with time it was modified 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.840
 everything but my daughter the dogs the times 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.030
 the football of the town is adapting 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.820
 but once a week I'm going to define 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.259
 the dogs something that already comes from family 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.270
 and then when he met my lady 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.919
 we agreed that we were both the same and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.130
 like a little bit was magnified 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.130
 plus 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.620
 two
