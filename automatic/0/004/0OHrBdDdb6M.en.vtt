00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.240 
about that there's obviously a lot of
things<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.810> still<00:00:22.050> clean<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.130> got<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
things to still clean up but we got a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.679 
things to still clean up but we got a
lot<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.430> young<00:00:23.730> guys<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.300> getting<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> lot

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689

lot of young guys that are getting a lot
of<00:00:24.750> reps<00:00:25.050> right<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:25.800> didn't<00:00:26.010> get

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
of reps right now that they didn't get

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.620 
of reps right now that they didn't get
in<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> fall<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.699> think<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.390> good

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630

in the fall so I think it's really good
for<00:00:27.840> us<00:00:27.900> our<00:00:28.109> depth<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:29.519> better<00:00:29.699> than

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
for us our depth is so much better than

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.490 
for us our depth is so much better than
it<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.480> feel<00:00:30.990> good<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.470> progress

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it was so feel good about the progress

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.190 
it was so feel good about the progress

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
of battle in the trenches a little bit
kind<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.809> each<00:00:37.290> side<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.980> yeah

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
you know we always we always start up

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.799 
you know we always we always start up
front<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.800> third<00:00:41.520> downs<00:00:41.790> short<00:00:42.480> yardage

third down and goal line and and those
types<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.110> more

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
types of things that as we get more

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.110 
types of things that as we get more
confident<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.129> magnified<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
confident it's also magnified because I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.369 
confident it's also magnified because I
mentioned<00:00:48.570> these<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.780> guys<00:00:48.870> before<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.200> got

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
mentioned these two guys before we got

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
mentioned these two guys before we got
great<00:00:49.559> depth<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.980> every<00:00:50.190> position<00:00:50.370> except<00:00:50.969> why

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
great depth at every position except why

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.700 
great depth at every position except why
not<00:00:51.300> we're<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.750> thin<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.170> wideout<00:00:52.350> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
not we're really thin at wideout this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
not we're really thin at wideout this
spring<00:00:53.070> partly<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.210> move<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.539> guys

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
spring partly because we move some guys

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
spring partly because we move some guys
over<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.989> defense<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:56.969> probably

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
over to defense you know it's probably

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.209 
over to defense you know it's probably
not<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.360> best<00:00:57.480> interest<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> spring<00:00:58.469> ball<00:00:58.649> but

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
not the best interest of spring ball but

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.410 
not the best interest of spring ball but
I'm<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.430> worried<00:00:59.609> about<00:00:59.640> winning<00:01:00.090> spring

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
I'm not worried about winning spring

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.369 
I'm not worried about winning spring
ball<00:01:00.600> worried<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:00.930> what's<00:01:01.079> gonna<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
ball worried about what's gonna be the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
ball worried about what's gonna be the
best<00:01:01.530> person<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.920> fall<00:01:02.160> especially<00:01:02.460> because

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
best person to fall especially because

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
best person to fall especially because
we<00:01:03.059> got<00:01:03.180> five<00:01:03.449> incoming<00:01:04.110> freshman<00:01:04.530> wide

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
we got five incoming freshman wide

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.750 
we got five incoming freshman wide
receivers<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.309> feel<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.610> good

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
receivers that we feel a little good

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
receivers that we feel a little good
about<00:01:05.939> coming<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.840> problem<00:01:07.470> will

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
about coming in so that problem will

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440 
about coming in so that problem will
solve<00:01:07.710> itself<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.150> why<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
solve itself in time but that's why we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.580 
solve itself in time but that's why we
also<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.110> emphasis<00:01:10.470> on

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
also have a little bit more emphasis on

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.200 
also have a little bit more emphasis on
running<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> ball<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.970> being<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
running the ball right now for being a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.640 
running the ball right now for being a
little<00:01:12.420> thin<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> defensive<00:01:13.200> line<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
little thin on the defensive line you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
little thin on the defensive line you
had<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.070> playmakers<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.970> didn't

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
had some playmakers there they didn't

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.960 
had some playmakers there they didn't
