00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 of course I want you too 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.230
 in short the internet function of sony 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.330
 introduce xperia set one and go though 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.330
 we're talking about the browser chrome and 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.869
 open my page and that is www.mc point 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.999
 It takes a long time to load 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 and that's why you see the loading bar like 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.460
 are over wlan in the network the device becomes 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 supports going from gps edge umts 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.000
 hsdpa hsupa lte and wlan 802.11 abgn 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.510
 so now we are here when the imc 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 de 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.730
 and you can of course by pinch to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 zoom zoom in that is natural as 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 browser dependent here on the device 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.640
 comes chrome as a browser i could 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 of course, there are more stock exchanges in place 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 Goalkeeper loading 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.540
 otherwise we have here but factory 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.460
 first, no other browser with it 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.869
 I already told you to pinch to zoom 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.189
 Of course you can also double-click 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.460
 then do my news man behind pic 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.859
 nic 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.719
 and then of course the text will be like that 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.609
 unbroken on the on the display 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.009
 fits and that you can read it well 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.929
 and that's not a mobile customized now 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.899
 page despite the display so big 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.969
 actually, that lyrics well on it 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.560
 can read 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.560
 yes that's with such a certain 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.189
 size but then ok let's go 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.340
 on a mobile the side the world to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.600
 For example look at what it looks like as 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.490
 the already mobile adapted 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.109
 they are asked here if you are direct 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.909
 want to change the language because the page 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.450
 now it is in English whether we are 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.659
 want to translate and so on 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 you can read the article states and here 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.049
 You see , he keeps asking that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.270
 No one can be translated Yes 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.020
 Let's translate myself now 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.020
 sometimes interesting 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.880
 So if you read the text if 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.009
 you can read it then well 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.630
 practically because in part it will be fine 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.670
 translated but these are of course the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.360
 one or the other , of course , we spoke there 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.070
 if you look here for example 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.590
 she became different in june 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.220
 Marketing positions at the companies 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.490
 as the one appointed and the one that is here 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.370
 not correct 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.800
 Before that she was a tv reporter and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.860
 Producer be you notice it is 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.050
 not very well translated but it works 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.970
 if you do not understand English then 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.350
 can you use this here so we look 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.730
 Let's see the function up here 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.440
 you the three points the three points 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.390
 of course always mean settings 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.459
 you can choose sides as favorites here 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.070
 Add a new one to a new tab 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.400
 open incognito tabs open bookmark 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.560
 give other equipment we view this 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.660
 at times 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.250
 grab them on tabs to see them 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.780
 have opened on your computer 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.220
 Of course that would mean that you have electricity 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.050
 used on a computer 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.400
 Here you have the course on page 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.910
 I could search desktop version 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.260
 display additional settings 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.739

 and jump or resp 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.489
 cool animated close other tabs here 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.269

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.459
 still the possibility here of course just 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.180

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.870
 of course not cancel 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.590
 that's what the app looks like for the first time 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.940
 Recommended videos can be more here 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.729

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.050
 Settings do not click again 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.280
 on the video of interviewed and we 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.970
 Look again briefly for the quality 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.970
 on the device 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.709
 up here you see we look in hd me 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:25.709
 Of course I still have to distribute the whole thing 

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:29.399
 and save view the picture quality 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:37.069
 in hd very cool duty looks very good 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:39.509
 but the sound is on this device 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.549
 Not so good with the video 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.619
 I think why we look 

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:46.619
 us in the multimedia part again 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:49.610

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.610
 Sound is there again
