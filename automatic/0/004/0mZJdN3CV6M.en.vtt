bump<00:01:12.910> stops<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.600> for<00:01:13.840> auto<00:01:14.080> racing<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:15.160> is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
bump stops so for auto racing this is

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.910 
bump stops so for auto racing this is
super<00:01:15.729> important<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.390> control<00:01:17.050> how<00:01:17.710> much

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
super important to control how much

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
terrain they prepare a special sticky

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.650 
terrain they prepare a special sticky
tire<00:01:32.830> for<00:01:33.190> us<00:01:33.280> that<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:33.970> can<00:01:34.149> run<00:01:34.300> at<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.479> higher

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
tire for us that we can run at a higher

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.630 
tire for us that we can run at a higher
pressure<00:01:34.960> but<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:35.770> got<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.920> super<00:01:36.369> sticky

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
pressure but it's got a super sticky

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.700 
pressure but it's got a super sticky
compound<00:01:36.850> that's<00:01:37.570> key<00:01:37.960> for<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.410> type<00:01:38.560> of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
compound that's key for the type of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.200 
compound that's key for the type of
racing<00:01:39.009> we're<00:01:39.190> doing<00:01:39.399> before<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.850> have<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.119> go

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
racing we're doing before you have to go

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.240 
racing we're doing before you have to go
fast<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.810> slow<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:43.990> car<00:01:44.289> is<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.530> custom

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
fast and slow so this car is a custom

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.609 
fast and slow so this car is a custom
chassis<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.509> part<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.020> custom

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
chassis and as part of the custom

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.710 
chassis and as part of the custom
chassis<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.039> we<00:01:48.250> do<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.149> engine<00:01:49.570> is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
chassis that we do is the engine is

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.139 
chassis that we do is the engine is
offset<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.530> passenger<00:01:50.979> side<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.580> it's

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
offset to the passenger side and it's

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.330 
offset to the passenger side and it's
also<00:01:52.330> angled<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.009> actually

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
also angled so that it's actually

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.490 
also angled so that it's actually
pointing<00:01:54.550> toward<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.209> driver's<00:01:55.630> seat<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.440> to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
pointing toward the driver's seat so to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.499 
pointing toward the driver's seat so to
do<00:01:56.709> this<00:01:56.890> what<00:01:57.429> we've<00:01:57.580> done<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.880> offset<00:01:58.390> it

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
do this what we've done is offset it

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.820 
do this what we've done is offset it
from<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.690> differential<00:01:59.349> because<00:01:59.560> you've<00:01:59.679> got

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
from the differential because you've got

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.460 
from the differential because you've got
a<00:01:59.860> big<00:02:00.179> suspension<00:02:01.179> coming<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.630> down<00:02:01.750> and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
a big suspension coming up and down and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.919 
a big suspension coming up and down and
it<00:02:02.860> also<00:02:03.009> offsets<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.759> weight<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.720> car

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
it also offsets the weight so the car

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.440 
it also offsets the weight so the car
has<00:02:04.959> a<00:02:05.200> perfect<00:02:05.709> 50/50<00:02:06.429> balance<00:02:06.729> for<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.270> rear

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
has a perfect 50/50 balance for the rear

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.960 
has a perfect 50/50 balance for the rear
and<00:02:07.690> left<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> right

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.820 

right<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.690> next<00:02:15.900> thing<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.350> we're<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
right the next thing is we're on the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.160 
right the next thing is we're on the
cockpit<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> two<00:02:18.420> passenger<00:02:18.930> car

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
cockpit so this is a two passenger car

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.250 
cockpit so this is a two passenger car
it's<00:02:19.740> very<00:02:19.950> tight<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.050> not

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
it's very tight this is this is not

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.330 
it's very tight this is this is not
