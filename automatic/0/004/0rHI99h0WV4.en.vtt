one piece 691 the king of the land of
death<00:00:02.879> just<00:00:03.780> like<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.259> other<00:00:04.500> chapters<00:00:05.460> well

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.970

might<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:09.660> been<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.050> few<00:00:10.320> pages<00:00:10.500> shorter<00:00:10.860> than

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570

feeling<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> those

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
feeling that be one or two more of those

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.790

a whole new way now cuz law opened up

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.010 
a whole new way now cuz law opened up
the<00:00:31.199> entire<00:00:31.550> mountain<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:33.000> his<00:00:33.180> cut<00:00:33.450> he's

won't be able to replace doflamingo

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.580 
won't be able to replace doflamingo

doflamingo does that's interesting

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
doflamingo does that's interesting
doflamingo<00:01:03.059> first<00:01:03.629> raga<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.140> he<00:01:04.229> has<00:01:04.350> a

sad past apparently no that's I'm sure

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.530 
sad past apparently no that's I'm sure
that's<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.110> people<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.619> saying<00:01:07.830> but

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
that's what people will be saying but

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.789 
that's what people will be saying but
that's<00:01:09.540> interesting<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.170> he<00:01:10.350> says<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that's interesting because he says you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
that's interesting because he says you
know<00:01:10.920> he<00:01:11.520> even<00:01:11.850> tells<00:01:12.000> smoker<00:01:12.450> tell<00:01:13.110> him<00:01:13.290> tell

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
know he even tells smoker tell him tell

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
know he even tells smoker tell him tell
him<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.340> no<00:01:14.520> way<00:01:14.670> he<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> replace

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
him that there's no way he can replace

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.960 
him that there's no way he can replace
him<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:17.040> strength<00:01:17.369> alone<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
him just with strength alone so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.280 
him just with strength alone so
apparently<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> something<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.930> smoker

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
apparently this is something that smoker

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.070 
apparently this is something that smoker
might<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.560> about<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.729> guess

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
might know about to I don't know I guess

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.780 
might know about to I don't know I guess
vice<00:01:22.080> admirals<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.890> high<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.400> people<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
vice admirals and high up people in the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
vice admirals and high up people in the
Murrays<00:01:24.060> might<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.840> more<00:01:25.080> about

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
Murrays might know a little more about

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.780 
Murrays might know a little more about
the<00:01:25.350> shichibukai<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:26.040> average<00:01:26.460> people

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the shichibukai than average people

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.370 
the shichibukai than average people
would<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.360> guess<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:27.990> sense<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.290> he

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
would so I guess I make sense that he

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
would so I guess I make sense that he
might<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.610> yeah<00:01:30.060> she<00:01:30.270> knew<00:01:30.360> Cooney's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
might know but yeah she knew Cooney's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.609 
might know but yeah she knew Cooney's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.800 
getting in everyone's running of course
oro<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.220> gone<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> wrong<00:01:32.700> way<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.420> let

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
oro had gone the wrong way but that let

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.760 
oro had gone the wrong way but that let
him<00:01:33.840> meet<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.200> everyone<00:01:34.320> else<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.740> i

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
him meet up with everyone else so i

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
him meet up with everyone else so i
guess<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.939> he

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
guess it's a good thing because he

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
guess it's a good thing because he
probably<00:01:36.450> would<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.750> run<00:01:37.020> straight<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> she

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
probably would have run straight to she

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.830 
probably would have run straight to she
no<00:01:37.920> kuni<00:01:38.189> i<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.700> i<00:01:38.880> saw<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.540> joke

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
no kuni i don't know i saw this joke

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
no kuni i don't know i saw this joke
online<00:01:40.229> i<00:01:40.259> said<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.680> zorro<00:01:40.920> was<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> navigator

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
online i said of zorro was the navigator

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
online i said of zorro was the navigator
they<00:01:42.270> probably<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.899> ended<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.259> at

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
they probably would have ended up at

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
they probably would have ended up at
rafiqul<00:01:43.799> by<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.100> i<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.119> that's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
really funny but anyway apparently a few

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
really funny but anyway apparently a few
countries<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.600> no<00:01:48.720> kuni<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:49.290> really

that will be the end of him I don't

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.039 
that will be the end of him I don't
think<00:03:25.639> he'll<00:03:25.879> last<00:03:26.150> through<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.780> mean

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
think he'll last through that I mean

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.479 
think he'll last through that I mean
it's<00:03:27.169> possible<00:03:27.290> he'll<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.739> absorb<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.220> rest

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
it's possible he'll just absorb the rest

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.189 
it's possible he'll just absorb the rest
of<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.790> shi<00:03:28.909> no<00:03:28.940> kuni<00:03:29.359> i<00:03:29.540> guess<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.049> could<00:03:30.169> be

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
of the shi no kuni i guess that could be

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.509 
of the shi no kuni i guess that could be
the<00:03:30.379> way<00:03:30.470> they<00:03:30.590> get<00:03:30.739> rid<00:03:30.889> of<00:03:30.919> it<00:03:31.040> if<00:03:31.190> he<00:03:31.310> just

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
the way they get rid of it if he just

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.890 
the way they get rid of it if he just
absorbs<00:03:31.879> it<00:03:31.970> all<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.239> get<00:03:32.389> bigger<00:03:32.569> and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
absorbs it all and get bigger and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.080 
absorbs it all and get bigger and
stronger<00:03:33.109> but<00:03:33.979> i<00:03:34.310> don't<00:03:34.489> know<00:03:34.549> i<00:03:34.579> don't<00:03:34.760> see

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
stronger but i don't know i don't see

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.050 
stronger but i don't know i don't see
