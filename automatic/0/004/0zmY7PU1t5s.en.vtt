 independent producers when buying them 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.000
 the African palm of a demonstration 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.180
 well that the peasants can overcome 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.800
 and room plus a cooperative with a lot 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.870
 pride we decide is an example here 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.409
 in the water valley and in all of Honduras 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.659
 It was 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.119
 wherever you want, we always represent 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.039
 like the peasants really 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.500
 we need state support for

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.770
 tons of product per hour 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.459

 full to create a good process 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.600
 as long as the fiber 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.799
 come out dry and have enough level 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.799
 for paying then
