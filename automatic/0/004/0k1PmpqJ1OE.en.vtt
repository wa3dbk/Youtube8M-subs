00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello, everyone, what are you waiting for? 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.790
 great as they say with flamenca and me 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.220
 because we are in fair time and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 I wanted to teach how to make this hairstyle that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 It seems very complicated but I promise that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 it is not and that way you can earn a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.049
 you can do what you can do 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 the hairstyle yourselves at home I do not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 I am a professional so the day the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 body teaches doing it a bit in my way 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 ok with my tricks but I do not know 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.300
 they officiate as a nation or more or less than 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.980
 also and nothing you can not only use this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 hairstyle to get to fairs but that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.579
 as we have to leave lengths that are 10 and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 the 20s 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 you can use it also if you had now 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.329
 some communion or some wedding or what 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.370
 so I do not expect you to like it and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 where to play the good tutorial we are going to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.329
 start and what we are going to need is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.510
 a comb worth skewers of this type 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.129
 quotes are worth I have these and I have 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.260
 you are also very finite and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.140
 transparent combines 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.200
 by guillermo demonio 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.360
 and normal ones and how can you not 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.330
 missing a typical accessory is worth I go to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.400
 use this red flower but also 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.590
 you can use comb and what you have 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.330
 ok let's start doing some 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.830
 stripes could it do to the middle if 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.430
 You want but I'll do to the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.110
 a side 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.759
 I know I have done some stripes but it has 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 that being one of them was far away 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.110
 I have a little diagonal 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 and now what we are going to do is what 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.490
 would be fringe areas with 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.180
 already collected areas worth 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.180
 and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 I'm going to make a kind of the ear and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 this I'm going to throw back and what 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.960
 same on this side 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.310
 and now what I'm going to do is pick me up 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.380
 a pigtail wants back it's worth it so that 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 turn around and I'm going to wet all this hair 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.790
 very much with water is very very wet and 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.710
 I'm going to throw myself a good goop of 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.540
 Gomina wanted to be the first to love the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.450
 water on this side and then a little 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.510
 towards this side it's worth then I already have 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.610
 as you can see the pretty wet bangs and 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.610
 with gel so I'm going to comb it 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.349
 we ask it a little bit like backwards it's worth 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.090
 on the part of the most separated things 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.090
 to comb back well 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.250
 and now I'm going to place my hand on the line 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.800
 As you can see he's in line, I open the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.250
 Angular finger as you see and I come 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.740
 down 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 once determined down I'll 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.500
 to turn the comb so I will hold this 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 curl that has formed 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.580
 I remove the comb 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.680
 and now I'm going to remove the fingers of this 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.070
 way forward 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.460
 instead of going to do like that there and to 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.460
 in front of 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.840
 and now I'm going to place a clamp 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:13.060
 so much in the wave that has formed 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.680
 as in the beginning as you see it has 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 formed here another wave if I wanted 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.510
 take advantage to put another track 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:30.950
 without action before turning the comb 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.120
 I hold it right so I can stand it here 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.120
 and I was going back 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.050
 ah 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.340
 and the subjects 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.190
 I'm going to put another clamp here for 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.190
 mark the time a little 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:05.180
 and so we're going to leave it bad we're going to 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.999
 ventilated combed back and I'm going to 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.349
 place only two fingers this time 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:14.550
 open a little bit of and not down I turn the 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.810
 hair comb 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.810
 the objects 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.699
 I'm going to comb this back 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:36.470
 there 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:40.540
 I'm going to put that pizza and the neutral and 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.540
 I'm going to put on this side now 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.470
 richard silver 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.230
 and now let's take a tour towards 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.660
 a good side I'm going to do it towards 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.400
 the right side and what I 'm going to do is 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:02.139
 to let go of my hair and it comes to catch me 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.139
 a pigtail to one side 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.569
 We want to make a fish braid from 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.569
 life 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.400
 we hold it down here with a rubber band 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.400
 of transparent 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.750
 we are going to define it 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.970
 let's throw some lacquer 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.200
 because I have many layers and they come out 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.200
 quite 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:49.479
 and now to 0 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.960
 Y 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.699
 Y 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.210
 and we are going to hold it with marquillas de 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.210
 the demons 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.630
 we throw some lacquer for the collected 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.630
 it would be like that 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.710
 and let's wait for it to dry 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.990
 We are going to try to see you 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.790
 first reign and then already make up or 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.140
 made so that it gives time to dry and a 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.090
 Once it is dry we will remove the 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.980
 clamp carefully and the 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.200
 bad wave finally like I'm not going to 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.170
 place the flower you can place it here at 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.090
 side if you want but I'm going to put it 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.700
 here on top because I have a lot of friends 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:59.130
 that they place the flower here so nothing 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.130
 easy with a fork we put it 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.680
 that would make the hairstyle 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.930
 so nothing girls I hope that I have 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.570
 easy result and you enjoy this 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.860
 fair time or send a kiss and we 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.860
 we see in the next video chao
