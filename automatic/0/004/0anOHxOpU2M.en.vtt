than<00:03:12.820> just<00:03:13.030> eight<00:03:13.239> years<00:03:13.540> ago<00:03:13.720> shooting<00:03:14.650> isn't

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
than just eight years ago shooting isn't

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.220 
than just eight years ago shooting isn't
terribly<00:03:15.280> precise<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.510> game's<00:03:16.720> definitely<00:03:17.200> a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
terribly precise the game's definitely a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.310 
terribly precise the game's definitely a
bit<00:03:17.410> short<00:03:17.799> thing<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.549> yes<00:03:19.390> gun<00:03:19.840> has<00:03:20.079> its

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
bit short thing is yes gun has its

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.500 
bit short thing is yes gun has its
shortcomings<00:03:20.769> but<00:03:21.250> its<00:03:21.400> gameplay<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:22.120> just

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
shortcomings but its gameplay is just

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.599 
shortcomings but its gameplay is just
good<00:03:22.750> enough<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.470> let<00:03:23.590> its<00:03:23.739> character<00:03:24.310> shine

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
good enough to let its character shine

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.420 
good enough to let its character shine
and<00:03:24.940> character<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.170> where<00:03:26.410> gun<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:27.070> right<00:03:27.280> on

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and character is where gun is right on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.760 
and character is where gun is right on
target<00:03:28.170> failure

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
target failure

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.839 
target failure
not<00:03:29.950> an<00:03:30.100> option

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.390 

yeah
