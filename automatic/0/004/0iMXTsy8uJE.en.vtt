two videos in our series we concentrated

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.230 
two videos in our series we concentrated
on<00:00:10.830> our<00:00:11.130> dorsiflexion<00:00:11.759> right<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.150> our

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
on our dorsiflexion right in our

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.270 
on our dorsiflexion right in our
stability<00:00:12.480> through<00:00:12.929> our<00:00:13.049> core<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.920> if<00:00:14.130> you

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
stability through our core so if you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160 
stability through our core so if you
remember<00:00:14.580> we've<00:00:15.299> gotten<00:00:15.570> our<00:00:15.630> dorsiflex

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
remember we've gotten our dorsiflex

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.330 
remember we've gotten our dorsiflex
position<00:00:16.560> where<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> bottom<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.070> our<00:00:17.130> foots

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
position where the bottom of our foots

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.859 
position where the bottom of our foots
parallel<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> ground<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.690> actually

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
parallel to the ground and we actually

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.290 
parallel to the ground and we actually
use<00:00:19.260> stabilization<00:00:20.010> she<00:00:20.490> jumped<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
use stabilization she jumped off of that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.929 
use stabilization she jumped off of that
foot<00:00:21.539> rotate<00:00:22.380> under<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.100> catch<00:00:23.490> ourselves

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
foot rotate under and catch ourselves

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
foot rotate under and catch ourselves
without<00:00:24.060> letting<00:00:24.510> ak4<00:00:24.869> fall<00:00:25.170> forward<00:00:25.650> right

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
without letting ak4 fall forward right

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
without letting ak4 fall forward right
so<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> reason<00:00:26.730> why<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.630> no

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
so the reason why we do this it's no

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.210 
so the reason why we do this it's no
