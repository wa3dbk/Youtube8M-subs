maybe<00:01:19.690> I<00:01:19.780> should<00:01:19.930> design<00:01:20.170> either<00:01:20.350> like<00:01:20.880> that's

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
maybe I should design either like that's

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.380 
maybe I should design either like that's
how<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.090> learn<00:01:22.270> how<00:01:22.420> to

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
gripped by this guy yeah I always like

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.470 
gripped by this guy yeah I always like
to<00:02:46.380> scrape<00:02:46.890> off<00:02:47.069> these<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.700> cards<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.330> so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
to scrape off these little cards just so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.289 
to scrape off these little cards just so
I<00:02:48.510> don't<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.840> anything<00:02:49.019> sticking<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
I don't have anything sticking up and

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.850 
I don't have anything sticking up and
scrape<00:02:51.299> down<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.540> sides<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.200> well<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
scrape down the sides really well so the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.580 
scrape down the sides really well so the
grip<00:02:53.040> tape<00:02:53.220> doesn't<00:02:53.610> peel<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:55.290> for

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
grip tape doesn't peel up and then for

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.850 
grip tape doesn't peel up and then for
the<00:02:55.680> trucks<00:02:56.040> again<00:02:56.879> I'm<00:02:57.330> skating<00:02:57.720> Thunder<00:02:58.560> hi

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
the trucks again I'm skating Thunder hi

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.580 
the trucks again I'm skating Thunder hi
and<00:02:59.810> these<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.349> believe<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.769> size<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:03.590> 147

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and these are I believe the size is 147

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.390 
and these are I believe the size is 147
because<00:03:05.459> those<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.910> what<00:03:05.940> fit<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:07.400> 7.75

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
because those are what fit the 7.75

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.059 
because those are what fit the 7.75
width<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> board<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:10.200> then<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> wheels

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
width of board and then for the wheels

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.920 
width of board and then for the wheels
I'm<00:03:11.430> skating<00:03:11.700> bones<00:03:12.120> Street<00:03:12.720> Tech<00:03:12.930> formula

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.470 

with<00:03:16.930> bones<00:03:17.200> Reds<00:03:17.740> bearings<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.640> always<00:03:19.240> like

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
with bones Reds bearings I always like

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.840 
with bones Reds bearings I always like
Street<00:03:20.050> tech<00:03:20.230> formula<00:03:20.680> because<00:03:20.980> they<00:03:21.130> do<00:03:21.190> not

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
Street tech formula because they do not

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.750 
Street tech formula because they do not
flat<00:03:22.390> spot<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:23.050> cannot<00:03:23.590> flat<00:03:23.950> spot<00:03:24.220> them<00:03:24.430> or

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
flat spot you cannot flat spot them or

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.780 
flat spot you cannot flat spot them or
at<00:03:24.940> least<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.360> haven't<00:03:25.720> been<00:03:26.080> able<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.350> yet<00:03:26.790> so
