week huh what's going on here well you
did<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.950> beautiful<00:01:57.160> job<00:01:57.429> on<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:57.940> Wow<00:01:58.149> let's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
did a beautiful job on this Wow let's

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.630 
did a beautiful job on this Wow let's
look<00:01:58.539> at<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.530> we<00:01:59.649> have<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.950> color-coded

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
look at that and we have the color-coded

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.820 
look at that and we have the color-coded
buttons<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.269> front<00:02:01.539> doors<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.649> each

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
buttons in the front doors so each

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.859 
buttons in the front doors so each
player<00:02:03.099> can<00:02:03.489> start<00:02:03.789> their<00:02:03.940> own<00:02:04.090> guy<00:02:04.420> up<00:02:04.660> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
player can start their own guy up and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.960 
player can start their own guy up and
then<00:02:05.470> we<00:02:05.739> can<00:02:05.920> always<00:02:06.159> convert<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.610> back<00:02:06.640> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
then we can always convert it back the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.300 
then we can always convert it back the
coin<00:02:07.239> up<00:02:07.390> if<00:02:07.599> he<00:02:07.720> wants<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:08.709> he<00:02:08.830> always<00:02:08.979> has

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
coin up if he wants to so he always has

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.869 
coin up if he wants to so he always has
that<00:02:09.489> option<00:02:11.400> actually<00:02:12.400> come<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.670> with<00:02:12.819> the

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
that option actually come in with the

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.540 
that option actually come in with the
back<00:02:13.060> door<00:02:13.300> wow<00:02:14.110> did<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.530> i<00:02:14.680> refilled<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
back door wow did you i refilled the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.350 
back door wow did you i refilled the
bottom<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.950> probably<00:02:18.400> did<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.909> did<00:02:19.120> so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
bottom of this you probably did I did so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.530 
bottom of this you probably did I did so
many<00:02:19.569> on<00:02:19.840> can't<00:02:20.800> remember<00:02:21.190> well<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> see<00:02:22.420> you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
many on can't remember well I see you

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.559 
many on can't remember well I see you
put<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.750> new<00:02:22.900> power<00:02:23.170> supply<00:02:23.409> in<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
put a new power supply in it and the

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.509 
put a new power supply in it and the
amplifier<00:02:26.170> has<00:02:26.500> been<00:02:26.680> rebuilt<00:02:27.099> with<00:02:27.250> all<00:02:27.400> new

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
amplifier has been rebuilt with all new

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.490 
amplifier has been rebuilt with all new
capacitors<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.659> with<00:02:28.810> every<00:02:29.019> x-men

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
capacitors we do that with every x-men

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.559 
capacitors we do that with every x-men
board<00:02:29.800> Chris<00:02:30.760> does<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.209> he<00:02:31.360> does<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
board Chris does that he does a

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.449 
board Chris does that he does a
wonderful<00:02:31.840> job<00:02:32.080> getting<00:02:32.980> these<00:02:33.250> new

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
wonderful job getting these new

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.300 
wonderful job getting these new
capacitors<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.599> are<00:02:34.720> heavy<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.010> high

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
capacitors in that are heavy and high

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.640 
capacitors in that are heavy and high
rated<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.450> they'll<00:02:37.629> never<00:02:37.810> leak<00:02:38.110> again<00:02:38.440> and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
rated so they'll never leak again and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.550 
rated so they'll never leak again and
ruin<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.069> board<00:02:39.370> without<00:02:40.360> those<00:02:40.750> capacitors

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
ruin that board without those capacitors

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.070 
ruin that board without those capacitors
thus<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.299> amplifier<00:02:43.299> won't<00:02:43.540> work<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.930> will

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
thus the amplifier won't work you will

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.440 
thus the amplifier won't work you will
lose<00:02:44.290> your<00:02:44.470> stereo<00:02:44.890> sound<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.850> course<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.300> have

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
lose your stereo sound of course we have

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.699 
lose your stereo sound of course we have
the<00:02:46.569> chassis<00:02:46.930> only

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
the chassis only
