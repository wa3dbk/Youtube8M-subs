Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and we are here again with Karon Kay

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.410
and her husband Dave, and we are in Spokane,
still.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.180
And, I don’t know if you could see the kids
in the mirror, they’re hiding out.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.030
Hi…Hi guys.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.679
We are here because Dave built Karon a gorgeous
cabinet, and you have to see what’s inside,

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:38.860
ooh, look at that, oh my gosh, this is filled
with all of Karon’s gorgeous jewelry, and

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.990
most of it, you’ve made, and your sister,
right?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.200
(K) My sister and I have made most of it.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.860
(C) Wouldn’t you guys just die to have a
Dave in your life?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.340
That can build you one of these great cabinets?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.050
(K) No, no, no, he’s mine.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.180
(C) He is yours.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.920
*Laughing** Okay, it has to be a different
Dave, but don’t you want a cabinet like

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.969
this, it’s awesome.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.950
We have to show you this cool cabinet that
Dave has built for Karon, and look what’s

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.440
inside, look, it’s got all these skinny
drawers, and oh, my, gosh...guys, you wouldn’t

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.260
believe… she has worked so hard, I see tutorials
all over the place in here.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.950
Let’s see, some Mica Shift is in here, what
else?

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.130
(K) The Rose cane.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.220
(C) Oh, Rose cane, gorgeous.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.530
(K) Snowman.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:42.890
(C) Oh, and a little Snowman, what else you
got… oh Pandora beads, oh nice big giant

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.890
ones…

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.910
I’m wearing my bracelet too, see?

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.940
(K) Are you…oh you are.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.470
(C) We got kinda the same thing going on here,
alright, what else?

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.240
(K) Let’s see, Butterfly wings?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.030
(C) Ooh, pretty color combination, oh, look
at that, looks like she’s put a little…

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.470
tiny little rivet in there.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.910
(K) I do, I use rivets on all of those so
that they last longer when you put them on

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.910
a necklace.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.910
(C) Good idea.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.000
(K) I did the same thing with the leaves over
there.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.230
C) The thin… anything thin?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.370
(K) You know what, I’ll bet they’re up
here.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.769
(C) She’s got drawers and drawers, any of
you guys that are beaders would go nuts for

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:26.879
this stuff….oh, oh, oh, Roses and Calla
Lilies, and what else?

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.989
A Parrot Tulip…

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.010
(K) Hibiscus.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.040
(C) Oh it’s a Hibiscus, you know why I said…that
happened, some of you, that have done the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.870
tutorial, the inside base is a tear drop shape,
she had the tear drop flipped over, so that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.400
the point was at the bottom instead of at
the top and it ended up making the shape of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.550
the flower a Hibiscus shape, so if you wanna
make Hibiscus with that tutorial, flip it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.550
over.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.550
(K) There you go.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.550
(C) Alright…

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.910
(K) There should be some little leaves over
there.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.680
(C) Oh, there’s… no, there’s some...there’s
just treasures beyond what you could imagine…

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
(K) More Hibiscus.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680
(C) More Hibiscus…

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.989
(K) Different color.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.709

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.200
