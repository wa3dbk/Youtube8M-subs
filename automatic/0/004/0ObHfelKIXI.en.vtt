uh that feature only works when the
device<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.149> plugged<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> could<00:00:49.440> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
device is plugged in so I could just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.340 
device is plugged in so I could just
take<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.129> um<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.329> again<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
take that up um so now again this is a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.610
