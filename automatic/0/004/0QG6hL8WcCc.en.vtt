the character color of the car so we

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.909 
the character color of the car so we
gave<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.699> a<00:04:02.849> look<00:04:03.060> we<00:04:03.329> gave<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.919> bamboo

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
gave it a look we gave it the bamboo

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.860 
gave it a look we gave it the bamboo

when<00:04:15.659> it<00:04:15.689> was<00:04:15.840> being<00:04:16.019> restored<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.530> was<00:04:16.650> told

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
when it was being restored I was told

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.099 
when it was being restored I was told
well<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.489> won't<00:04:17.760> fit<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> column<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
well it won't fit the column of the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.249 
well it won't fit the column of the
Volkswagen<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.789> said<00:04:21.180> well<00:04:21.299> what<00:04:22.019> if<00:04:22.139> we

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
Volkswagen so I said well what if we

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.320 
Volkswagen so I said well what if we
remove<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> column<00:04:22.919> right<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:23.729> that<00:04:24.090> was<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
remove the column right so that was the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.240 
remove the column right so that was the
answer<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.750> remove<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> column<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.979> gave

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
answer we remove the column and it gave

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.159 
answer we remove the column and it gave
me<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.430> opportunity<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.810> steering

horsepower<00:04:40.429> it<00:04:41.299> moved<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.659> car<00:04:41.839> well<00:04:42.049> I

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
horsepower it moved the car well I

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.169 
horsepower it moved the car well I
wanted<00:04:42.799> just<00:04:42.979> a<00:04:43.039> little<00:04:43.339> bit<00:04:43.489> more<00:04:43.699> sense<00:04:43.999> to

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:44.179 
wanted just a little bit more sense to

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:47.289 
wanted just a little bit more sense to
it<00:04:44.419> so<00:04:44.749> I<00:04:44.779> had<00:04:45.289> as<00:04:45.889> part<00:04:46.279> of<00:04:46.309> the<00:04:46.429> restoration

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:47.299 
it so I had as part of the restoration

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:50.889 
it so I had as part of the restoration
I<00:04:47.329> had<00:04:47.899> the<00:04:48.199> engine<00:04:48.860> rebuild<00:04:49.699> as<00:04:49.969> a<00:04:50.689> wood

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:50.899 
I had the engine rebuild as a wood

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.600 
I had the engine rebuild as a wood
higher<00:04:51.049> performance<00:04:51.679> would<00:04:52.239> expect<00:04:53.239> if<00:04:53.419> a

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
higher performance would expect if a

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.859 
higher performance would expect if a
1776<00:04:55.610> CC<00:04:56.209> engine<00:04:56.749> which<00:04:57.349> has<00:04:57.559> bigger<00:04:57.860> piston

00:04:58.859 --> 00:04:58.869 
1776 CC engine which has bigger piston

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:01.929 
1776 CC engine which has bigger piston
increases<00:04:59.869> the<00:04:59.959> horsepower<00:05:00.439> to<00:05:00.949> about<00:05:01.610> 18

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
increases the horsepower to about 18

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.850 
increases the horsepower to about 18
horsepower<00:05:02.179> and<00:05:02.719> it's<00:05:02.899> all<00:05:03.019> for<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.349> for

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
horsepower and it's all for that for

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.979 
horsepower and it's all for that for
that<00:05:03.889> kind<00:05:04.009> of<00:05:04.219> horses<00:05:04.729> on<00:05:04.909> a<00:05:04.969> car<00:05:05.599> like<00:05:05.779> this

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:05.989 
that kind of horses on a car like this

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:09.309 
that kind of horses on a car like this
it's<00:05:06.259> very<00:05:06.529> light<00:05:07.629> it's<00:05:08.629> you<00:05:08.869> can<00:05:09.049> feel<00:05:09.199> the

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
it's very light it's you can feel the

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.069 
it's very light it's you can feel the
significance<00:05:10.129> in<00:05:10.369> the<00:05:10.879> power<00:05:11.179> of<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.779> engine

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:12.079 
significance in the power of the engine

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:15.850 
significance in the power of the engine
as<00:05:12.229> it<00:05:12.589> pulls<00:05:12.829> the<00:05:13.039> car<00:05:13.569> so<00:05:14.569> this<00:05:14.779> car<00:05:15.019> is<00:05:15.289> not

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
as it pulls the car so this car is not

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.600 
as it pulls the car so this car is not
obviously<00:05:16.489> a<00:05:17.289> muscle<00:05:18.289> car<00:05:18.499> it's<00:05:19.069> a<00:05:19.219> cruising

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
obviously a muscle car it's a cruising

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.699 
obviously a muscle car it's a cruising
current<00:05:19.969> and<00:05:20.299> that's<00:05:20.360> what<00:05:20.599> I<00:05:20.629> use<00:05:20.839> before<00:05:21.229> I

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:21.709 
current and that's what I use before I

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:25.419 
current and that's what I use before I
attend<00:05:22.399> shows<00:05:22.699> and<00:05:23.179> it's<00:05:24.079> a<00:05:24.319> pleasure<00:05:25.159> to

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:25.429 
attend shows and it's a pleasure to

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.489 
attend shows and it's a pleasure to
drive<00:05:25.579> and<00:05:25.849> on<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.539> road<00:05:26.719> with<00:05:27.409> the

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:27.499 
drive and on the road with the

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.129 
drive and on the road with the
performance<00:05:28.009> gains<00:05:28.279> that<00:05:28.459> we<00:05:28.610> had<00:05:28.849> we<00:05:29.689> enjoyed

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
performance gains that we had we enjoyed

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.279 
performance gains that we had we enjoyed
the<00:05:30.409> poor<00:05:30.739> engine<00:05:31.249> especially<00:05:31.489> going<00:05:32.059> uphill

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
the poor engine especially going uphill

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.689 
the poor engine especially going uphill
the<00:05:33.289> reaction<00:05:33.649> I<00:05:33.679> usually<00:05:34.039> get<00:05:34.159> from<00:05:34.249> people

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
the reaction I usually get from people

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
wasn't sure if I was going to restore it

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.429 
wasn't sure if I was going to restore it
to<00:05:51.409> a<00:05:51.439> hot<00:05:52.219> rod<00:05:52.489> or<00:05:52.879> restore<00:05:53.629> it<00:05:53.749> to<00:05:53.899> a<00:05:53.929> classic

I like both but I really do enjoy the
classic<00:05:58.219> look<00:05:58.429> I'm<00:05:58.639> very<00:05:58.939> satisfied<00:05:59.239> with

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:00.019 
classic look I'm very satisfied with

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:02.949 
classic look I'm very satisfied with
that<00:06:00.679> my<00:06:00.829> vision<00:06:01.069> came<00:06:01.459> through<00:06:01.729> we<00:06:02.449> described

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:02.959 
that my vision came through we described

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.379 
that my vision came through we described
which<00:06:03.079> restored<00:06:03.589> to<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:03.889> classic<00:06:04.459> look<00:06:04.699> with

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
which restored to a classic look with

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.449 
which restored to a classic look with
the<00:06:05.539> white<00:06:05.719> walls<00:06:06.019> those<00:06:06.409> of<00:06:06.649> the<00:06:07.219> wheel

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:07.459 
the white walls those of the wheel

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.609 
the white walls those of the wheel
matching<00:06:07.969> the<00:06:08.299> paint<00:06:08.569> of<00:06:08.719> the<00:06:08.749> car<00:06:09.019> the

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:09.619 
matching the paint of the car the

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.370 
matching the paint of the car the
dashboard<00:06:10.219> that<00:06:10.369> is<00:06:10.639> from

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
dashboard that is from

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.070 
dashboard that is from
earlier<00:06:11.710> years<00:06:12.390> so<00:06:13.390> I'm<00:06:13.600> really<00:06:13.810> satisfied

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
earlier years so I'm really satisfied

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.980 
earlier years so I'm really satisfied
that<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:14.920> vision<00:06:15.280> I<00:06:15.370> had<00:06:15.580> in<00:06:15.700> my<00:06:15.820> mind<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.750> came

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
that the vision I had in my mind it came

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:26.150 
that the vision I had in my mind it came
to<00:06:17.170> fruition

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:36.129
