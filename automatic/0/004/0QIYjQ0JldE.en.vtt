00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.459 
she'll always issue with the 10k attack
above<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> though<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:06.929> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.289> if<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
above that though so if you get if you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.590 
above that though so if you get if you
really<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> good<00:02:08.190> HP<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.880> recovery<00:02:09.270> you

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
really have a good HP in recovery you

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.969 
really have a good HP in recovery you
can<00:02:09.720> keep<00:02:09.840> tanking<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.350> over<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.770> over<00:02:10.830> again

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
can keep tanking it over and over again

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
can keep tanking it over and over again
if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> need<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.300> don't

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
if you need to but I really don't

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
if you need to but I really don't
recommend<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:12.990> if<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.410> get<00:02:13.530> orbit

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
recommend that because if you get orbit

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.309 
recommend that because if you get orbit
rolled<00:02:14.120> with<00:02:15.120> no<00:02:15.330> hard<00:02:15.540> orbs<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.990> you're

rolled with no hard orbs and you're

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.990 
rolled with no hard orbs and you're
probably<00:02:16.500> pretty<00:02:16.740> much<00:02:16.920> gonna<00:02:17.040> die<00:02:17.220> bonder

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
probably pretty much gonna die bonder

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.130 
worked ving like I know it could have
been<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.970> lot<00:03:18.180> more<00:03:18.270> combos<00:03:18.630> near<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.959> top

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
been like a lot more combos near the top

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.690 
been like a lot more combos near the top
but<00:03:19.380> there's<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.770> many<00:03:19.830> red<00:03:20.190> jumbled<00:03:20.640> up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
but there's just so many red jumbled up

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.259 
but there's just so many red jumbled up
that<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.000> would<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.450> freaked<00:03:21.690> out<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:23.370> I'll

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
that it would do it freaked out but I'll

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.430 
that it would do it freaked out but I'll
