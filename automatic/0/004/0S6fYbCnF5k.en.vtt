00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.940
 hi to all with that cups 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.830
 mobile.fr we are at ricoh what to 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.070
 the occasion of the ifa 2013 and I under 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.830
 the eyes the new steroid stairway 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.029
 is still part of the range 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.760
 rather high-end back 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.470
 finally morgan 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.880
 it smells in wikio that's still the way of 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.110
 range despite the specter rather 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.420
 interesting then we will spend on it 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.869
 we have what we have a 5 inch screen seduced 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.680
 ps 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.840
 hdc 1280 by 720 it is compatible h + 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.410
 no 4g on this device but h more 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.450
 on android 4.2.1 a quad processor 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.940
 core 1.2 gigabyte hertz 13 megapixel to 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.230
 level of optics and 5 megapixels at 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.550
 the front rather interesting if you 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.920
 want to take small ones 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.420
 photos with the front camera we have 16 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 gigabytes of internal memory with possibility 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.800
 to add up to 32 more via 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.900
 microsd a gig of ram is gorilla 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.540
 the ice on the screen and it's up to 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.089
 just about everything I've gipa under 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.800
 eyes the capacity of the battery it is 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.059
 will put in one sees will send to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.710
 the safety specifications article 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.790
 will be empty I think we have some 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.880
 when we talked about it ok then this 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.360
 terminal it will be available pretty much 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.680
 around 250 280 euros in these waters 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.270
 in fact we have not yet 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.549
 we are a price range but this 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.860
 will be pretty much that imagine that kind of 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.950
 this kind of tahiti is a device that 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.760
 actually does not think of a galaxy 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.590
 s right this kind of terminal so with 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.270
 here is the little logo ico audio output 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.950
 front camera down we had everything 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.020
 sensitive we will see a little better 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.750
 the screen choice of but you'll see them a 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.039
 shortly after on the right we have a button 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:46.450
 on / off lock unlock jack 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.219
 3.5 volume button and the rating is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.579
 removable to access the rest for 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:55.000
 insert the sim card and micro sd 13 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.860
 megapixels on the back the led flash the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.850
 loudspeaker justice and also because 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.299
 there is interesting about this 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.159
 apparatus 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.149
 it's this art of a little bit about 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:08.190
 slices and if we were to have fun a 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.490
 little we would do that and that's it 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.490
 than 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.310
 yes not much to say it's just 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.959
 that it's a little bit inspired what but 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.209
 to me it does not bother me I find it 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.690
 nice and we'll say it's more of a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.930
 good thing 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.370
 so let's move up interface like 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.489
 usual with Ricoh is rather 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.560
 android pretty crude 1 you'll see 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.720
 that's where I had this drawer that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.720
 allows access to different data 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.870
 here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
 okay 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.900
 here you have the buttons is pressed 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.900
 who is working here like that 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.000
 we can make a call on the saq which 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.530
 appears web browser etc 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.730
 we will not necessarily linger too much there 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.760
 you have after it's true that at yes that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.130
 we have products that sometimes have a design 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.750
 a bit 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.070
 which lacks originality but more 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.240
 more so the products are a little 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.970
 more interesting I find for example 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.140
 especially stairway which is mostly 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.770
 interesting is the price compared 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.030
 to the specs 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.800
 and there I find that the quality of 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.450
 manufacturing is pretty good it's a 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.620
 device that looks pretty good 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.960
 for the rest behind it's it 's 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.190
 classic android 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.930
 yeah what kind of device I have when 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.850
 even look forward to testing them because the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.850
 Level level finally feeling in hand 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.070
 it's pretty good we have good specs 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.220
 screen that seems to me rather rather not 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.220
 wrong 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.750
 so that's good to see during a test in 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.690
 anyway that was for our little one 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.230
 taking in hand the yes koster or and that's it 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.230
 see you soon
