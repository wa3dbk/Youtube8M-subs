00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
wasn't in one or fair to all black ops

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670 
wasn't in one or fair to all black ops
but<00:01:27.150> there's<00:01:27.479> recoil<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.990> battle<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
but there's recoil in battle so if you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.020 
but there's recoil in battle so if you
guys<00:01:28.799> came<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.369> black<00:01:29.610> ops<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.909> went

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
guys came from black ops and went

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
guys came from black ops and went
straight<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.630> fairy<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.500> should<00:01:31.710> be

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
straight to one or fairy you should be

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
straight to one or fairy you should be
able<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> burst<00:01:32.340> fire<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.820> he<00:01:32.939> did<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.210> black

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
able to burst fire like he did in black

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
able to burst fire like he did in black
ops<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> manage<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> recoil<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:35.670> now

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
ops just to manage the recoil a bit now

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
ops just to manage the recoil a bit now
some<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> things<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.740> about

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
some of the things I don't like about

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
some of the things I don't like about
the<00:01:38.130> game<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.430> far<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> maps<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.299> search

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the game so far the maps and search

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
the game so far the maps and search
industry<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.520> surprising<00:01:42.030> since<00:01:42.150> my

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
industry and that's surprising since my

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.819 
industry and that's surprising since my
channel<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> only<00:01:42.960> set<00:01:43.229> industry<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
channel is only set industry but the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.360 
channel is only set industry but the
thing<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.100> session<00:01:44.700> destroy<00:01:44.850> you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
thing about session destroy you

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.180 
thing about session destroy you
they<00:01:46.210> need<00:01:46.420> bigger<00:01:46.750> maps<00:01:47.050> these<00:01:47.470> maps<00:01:47.710> are<00:01:47.860> far

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
they need bigger maps these maps are far

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.280 
they need bigger maps these maps are far
too<00:01:48.220> small<00:01:48.460> for<00:01:48.820> session<00:01:49.150> destroy<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.990> spawns

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
too small for session destroy the spawns

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.380 
too small for session destroy the spawns
are<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:50.620> close<00:01:50.860> together<00:01:51.040> for<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.550> free<00:01:51.910> example

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
are so close together for a free example

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.840 
are so close together for a free example

you'll<00:01:59.170> get<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.410> flashed<00:01:59.710> from<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.730> get-go<00:02:00.940> as

whole other team waiting for you right

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.330 
whole other team waiting for you right
there<00:02:07.420> there's<00:02:08.320> no<00:02:08.500> way<00:02:08.680> you<00:02:08.740> can<00:02:08.950> implement

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
there there's no way you can implement

strike on to that map I mean I try to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.660 
strike on to that map I mean I try to
flank<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.100> doesn't<00:02:12.280> work<00:02:12.520> because

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
flank but it just doesn't work because

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.760 
flank but it just doesn't work because
the<00:02:13.240> maps<00:02:13.510> are<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.930> small<00:02:14.260> there<00:02:14.440> aren't<00:02:14.650> any

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the maps are so small there aren't any

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.890 
the maps are so small there aren't any
flank<00:02:15.100> crews<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.120> take<00:02:16.240> inserts

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
flank crews that you can take inserts

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.270 
flank crews that you can take inserts
from<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> get-go<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.950> face<00:02:18.130> them

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
from the get-go because you face them

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.980 
from the get-go because you face them
head-on<00:02:18.550> head<00:02:18.880> straight<00:02:19.210> away<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.600> hardly

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
head-on head straight away so I hardly

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.660 
head-on head straight away so I hardly
get<00:02:20.200> around<00:02:20.470> them<00:02:20.680> properly<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.550> of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
get around them properly this is one of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.580 
get around them properly this is one of
my<00:02:21.760> favorite<00:02:22.090> maps<00:02:22.240> village<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:23.410> decent

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
my favorite maps village it's decent

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.320 
my favorite maps village it's decent
this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.130> decent<00:02:24.490> size<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.000> actually<00:02:25.150> have

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
this is decent size so you actually have

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.480 
this is decent size so you actually have
space<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.020> run<00:02:26.170> around<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.590> bit<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.340> can

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
space to run around a bit so you can

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.730 
space to run around a bit so you can
think<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:28.000> where<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.480> want<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.930> instead<00:02:29.650> of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
think of where you want to go instead of

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.960 
think of where you want to go instead of
just<00:02:29.830> hitting<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> team<00:02:30.310> head<00:02:30.520> on<00:02:30.670> but

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
just hitting the team head on but

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.670 
just hitting the team head on but
hopefully<00:02:31.390> they<00:02:31.540> bring<00:02:31.720> us<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.050> TLC<00:02:32.530> with

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
hopefully they bring us on TLC with

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.230 
hopefully they bring us on TLC with
bigger<00:02:32.890> maps<00:02:33.130> because<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.670> maps<00:02:33.940> are<00:02:34.060> just

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
bigger maps because these maps are just

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.850 
bigger maps because these maps are just
far<00:02:34.420> too<00:02:34.450> small<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:35.020> search<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.290> destroy<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
far too small for search and destroy and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.920 
far too small for search and destroy and
Tamil<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.730> guys<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:37.180> if<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.360> play<00:02:37.540> session

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
Tamil you guys think if you play session

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.570 
Tamil you guys think if you play session
of<00:02:38.020> Sri<00:02:38.230> how<00:02:38.680> are<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:38.830> guys<00:02:39.070> enjoyed<00:02:39.400> the
