00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.899 

now<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.840> saltwater<00:00:01.260> aquarium<00:00:01.469> must<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> lot

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
now a saltwater aquarium must have a lot

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.630 
now a saltwater aquarium must have a lot
of<00:00:02.939> water<00:00:03.270> flow<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.810> recommend<00:00:04.560> 14<00:00:05.069> times<00:00:05.430> an

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
of water flow I recommend 14 times an

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.030 
of water flow I recommend 14 times an
hour<00:00:05.790> at<00:00:05.970> least<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.680> the<00:00:07.680> best<00:00:07.859> way<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
hour at least and the best way to

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.950 
hour at least and the best way to
provide<00:00:08.400> water<00:00:08.639> flow<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.660> saltwater

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
provide water flow in a saltwater

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.290 
provide water flow in a saltwater
aquarium<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> water<00:00:11.070> pump<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:12.120> that's

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
aquarium is with a water pump so that's

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.640 
aquarium is with a water pump so that's
a<00:00:12.389> water<00:00:12.570> pump<00:00:12.780> there<00:00:12.990> that's<00:00:13.200> jetting<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
a water pump there that's jetting the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.810 
a water pump there that's jetting the
water<00:00:13.830> towards<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.340> front<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.730> aquarium

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
water towards the front of the aquarium

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
water towards the front of the aquarium
and<00:00:15.299> then<00:00:15.809> agitating<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> surface<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
and then agitating the surface and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.470 
and then agitating the surface and
that's<00:00:18.300> called<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> horizontal<00:00:20.480> distribution

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
that's called a horizontal distribution

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
that's called a horizontal distribution
of<00:00:21.960> oxygen<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.490> vertical<00:00:24.029> so

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of oxygen and this is vertical so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.089 
of oxygen and this is vertical so
they're<00:00:24.570> basically<00:00:24.779> bubbles<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.890> put

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
they're basically bubbles that you put

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.870 
they're basically bubbles that you put
into<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> aquarium

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
into the aquarium

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000 
into the aquarium
now<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> bubbles<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> high<00:00:28.710> surface

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
now the bubbles have got a high surface

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.700 
now the bubbles have got a high surface
tension<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.480> only<00:00:30.660> actually<00:00:31.199> aerate<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
tension so they only actually aerate the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920 
tension so they only actually aerate the
water<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> bubble<00:00:32.489> pops<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.570> even

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
water when the bubble pops so even

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.360 
water when the bubble pops so even
though<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> looks<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.739> you've<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> lot<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
though it looks like you've got a lot of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.330 
though it looks like you've got a lot of
oxygen<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> aquarium<00:00:36.420> quite<00:00:37.200> often<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
oxygen in the aquarium quite often the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
oxygen in the aquarium quite often the
aquariums<00:00:38.879> run<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.300> weak<00:00:39.690> air<00:00:39.989> stones

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
aquariums run with weak air stones

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.979 
aquariums run with weak air stones
actually<00:00:40.829> lack<00:00:41.730> oxygen<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> low

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
actually lack oxygen and have a low

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.490 
actually lack oxygen and have a low
dissolved<00:00:43.320> oxygen<00:00:43.590> levels<00:00:44.219> now<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.420> far<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
dissolved oxygen levels now as far as a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.799 
dissolved oxygen levels now as far as a
saltwater<00:00:47.100> aquarium<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.760> concerned<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
saltwater aquarium is concerned the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.600 
saltwater aquarium is concerned the
bubbles<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.500> quite<00:00:49.739> annoying<00:00:50.010> because

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
bubbles can be quite annoying because

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240 
bubbles can be quite annoying because
they<00:00:50.940> pop<00:00:51.239> salt<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:52.199> over<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.829> top<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
they pop salt all over the top of the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799 
they pop salt all over the top of the
aquarium<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> extremely<00:00:54.600> annoying

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
aquarium which can be extremely annoying

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
aquarium which can be extremely annoying
and<00:00:55.199> increase<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:55.649> maintenance<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and increase your maintenance with a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
and increase your maintenance with a
freshwater<00:00:57.120> aquarium<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.320> isn't<00:00:58.530> such

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
freshwater aquarium it really isn't such

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.160 
freshwater aquarium it really isn't such
an<00:00:59.100> issue<00:00:59.250> with<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> saltwater<00:01:00.570> aquarium

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
an issue with a saltwater aquarium

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
an issue with a saltwater aquarium
that's<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:02.070> issue<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.120> providing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that's when it is an issue so providing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
that's when it is an issue so providing
good<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:03.989> flow<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.439> power<00:01:04.769> heads<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
good water flow with power heads that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.880 
good water flow with power heads that
are<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> agitate<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> surface<00:01:06.890> is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
are going to agitate the surface is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.469 
are going to agitate the surface is
going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> lower<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.520> surface<00:01:08.939> tension<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
going to lower your surface tension and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
going to lower your surface tension and
allow<00:01:09.780> good<00:01:10.080> gas<00:01:10.350> exchange<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.040> allow<00:01:11.250> good

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
allow good gas exchange and allow good

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.789 
allow good gas exchange and allow good
oxygen<00:01:11.820> levels<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.439> thing<00:01:13.619> that's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
oxygen levels but one thing that's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.679 
oxygen levels but one thing that's
really<00:01:14.040> annoying<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> have

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
really annoying is that when you have

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
really annoying is that when you have
the<00:01:15.840> bubbles<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.240> good

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the bubbles like this and you have good

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.020 
the bubbles like this and you have good
water<00:01:18.659> flow<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.610> happens

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
water flow like this then what happens

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.770 
water flow like this then what happens
is<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.140> bubbles<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.390> their<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
is the bubbles don't find their way to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
is the bubbles don't find their way to
the<00:01:24.990> top<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> aquarium<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the top of the aquarium like that and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
the top of the aquarium like that and
just<00:01:26.490> pop<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> water<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just pop out of the water because the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
just pop out of the water because the
water<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> moving<00:01:29.070> around<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.520> lot<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
water is moving around a lot more the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.080 
water is moving around a lot more the
bubbles<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.079> swept<00:01:31.500> away<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.610> create

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
bubbles get swept away and then create

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
bubbles get swept away and then create
micro<00:01:33.689> bubbles<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.259> micro<00:01:35.189> bubbles<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.670> very

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
micro bubbles and micro bubbles are very

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
micro bubbles and micro bubbles are very
annoying<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.229> tiny<00:01:37.530> tiny<00:01:37.920> tiny

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
annoying that's we these tiny tiny tiny

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.969 
annoying that's we these tiny tiny tiny
little<00:01:38.460> specks<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.030> bubble<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.740> water

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
little specks of bubble in the water

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
little specks of bubble in the water
which<00:01:41.220> discolors<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> water<00:01:42.270> makes<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> look

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
which discolors the water makes it look

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050 
which discolors the water makes it look
not<00:01:43.619> clear<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.250> actually<00:01:44.520> tiny<00:01:44.790> little

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
not clear but it's actually tiny little

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
not clear but it's actually tiny little
bubbles<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.770> micro

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bubbles if you think you do have micro

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.590 
bubbles if you think you do have micro
bubbles<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:48.000> hard<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
bubbles it can be very hard because it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840 
bubbles it can be very hard because it
looks<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.869> dust<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:50.130> basically<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.549> get<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
looks like dust you basically just get a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.639 
looks like dust you basically just get a
glass<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.360> water<00:01:51.570> put<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> somewhere<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
glass of water put it somewhere in the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
glass of water put it somewhere in the
sunlight<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.090> those<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.509> specks<00:01:54.869> go

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
sunlight and if those little specks go

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.209 
sunlight and if those little specks go
up<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> pop<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:57.630> they're<00:01:57.869> definitely

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
up and pop out then they're definitely

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
up and pop out then they're definitely
micro<00:01:59.219> bubbles<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> settle<00:02:00.810> on

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
micro bubbles if they go and settle on

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
micro bubbles if they go and settle on
the<00:02:01.079> bottom<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.619> they're<00:02:01.770> particles<00:02:02.100> if

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the bottom then they're particles if

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.569 
the bottom then they're particles if
they<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.090> particles<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.750> recommend<00:02:04.140> using

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
they are particles I recommend using

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.399 
they are particles I recommend using
using<00:02:05.579> polly<00:02:05.820> filter<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.320> will

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
using polly filter because that will

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.290 
using polly filter because that will
sort<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> worst<00:02:09.119> thing

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
sort that out and then the worst thing

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.820 
sort that out and then the worst thing
you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.629> do<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> water<00:02:10.410> pump<00:02:10.619> like

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you can do is have a water pump like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.680 
you can do is have a water pump like
this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.420 
this
and<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:11.960> have<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.260> bubbles<00:02:12.620> coming<00:02:13.040> up<00:02:13.190> and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
and then have the bubbles coming up and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.540 
and then have the bubbles coming up and
hitting<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.240> water<00:02:14.990> pump<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:16.070> shooting

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
hitting the water pump and then shooting

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.090 
hitting the water pump and then shooting
out<00:02:16.700> because<00:02:17.690> that's<00:02:17.930> when<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.320> get<00:02:18.440> heaps<00:02:18.830> of

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
out because that's when you get heaps of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.700 
out because that's when you get heaps of
micro<00:02:19.520> bubbles<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.260> micro<00:02:21.260> bubbles<00:02:21.440> are

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
micro bubbles and micro bubbles are

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.860 
micro bubbles and micro bubbles are
extremely<00:02:22.340> annoying<00:02:22.580> once<00:02:23.330> again<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
extremely annoying once again in a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.810 
extremely annoying once again in a
freshwater<00:02:24.200> aquarium<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:25.250> not<00:02:25.490> such<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
freshwater aquarium it's not such a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.920 
freshwater aquarium it's not such a
drama<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> can<00:02:27.710> see<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:28.660> you've<00:02:29.660> got<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
drama so you can see here you've got the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.770 
drama so you can see here you've got the
water<00:02:30.110> pump<00:02:30.440> that's<00:02:30.680> shooting<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.130> water<00:02:31.310> and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
water pump that's shooting the water and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.960 
water pump that's shooting the water and
agitating<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.870> surface<00:02:33.460> then<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.490> can<00:02:34.790> see

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
agitating the surface then you can see

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.020 
agitating the surface then you can see
across<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.330> back<00:02:35.660> you've<00:02:35.900> got<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.170> air<00:02:36.320> stone

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
across the back you've got the air stone

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.090 
across the back you've got the air stone
so<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> air<00:02:38.300> stone<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.870> not<00:02:39.440> creating

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
so the air stone is not creating

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.730 
so the air stone is not creating
anywhere<00:02:40.490> near<00:02:40.730> as<00:02:40.880> much<00:02:40.910> surface<00:02:41.740> agitation

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
anywhere near as much surface agitation

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.230 
anywhere near as much surface agitation
you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:42.980> see<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> surface<00:02:43.730> up<00:02:43.910> here<00:02:44.120> is

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
you can see the surface up here is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.330 
you can see the surface up here is
really<00:02:44.480> quite<00:02:44.810> flat<00:02:45.160> compared<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
really quite flat compared to the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.730 
really quite flat compared to the
surface<00:02:46.730> over<00:02:46.910> here<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.960> water<00:02:48.260> pumps<00:02:48.620> are

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
surface over here so water pumps are

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.470 
surface over here so water pumps are
definitely<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> better<00:02:49.520> way<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.790> doing<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.300> for

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
definitely a better way of doing it for

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.770 
definitely a better way of doing it for
a<00:02:51.050> freshwater<00:02:51.350> aquarium<00:02:52.660> powerheads<00:02:53.660> are

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
a freshwater aquarium powerheads are

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.660 
a freshwater aquarium powerheads are
totally<00:02:54.170> fine<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.710> be<00:02:55.160> careful<00:02:55.520> in

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
totally fine and be careful in

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.340 
totally fine and be careful in
situations<00:02:56.300> like<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.660> where<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> inlet<00:02:57.320> of

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
situations like this where the inlet of

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.410 
situations like this where the inlet of
your<00:02:57.590> filter<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.100> quite<00:02:58.880> close<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.330> the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
your filter is quite close to the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.090 
your filter is quite close to the
bubbles<00:02:59.750> these<00:03:00.050> ones<00:03:00.260> are<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.560> going<00:03:00.860> up<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
bubbles these ones are not going up the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.220 
bubbles these ones are not going up the
inlet<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.300> can<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.570> annoying<00:03:02.780> as<00:03:03.050> well

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
inlet but that can be annoying as well

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.810 
inlet but that can be annoying as well
because<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.560> can<00:03:03.860> get<00:03:04.040> micro<00:03:04.370> bubbles<00:03:04.520> all

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
because that can get micro bubbles all

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.990 
because that can get micro bubbles all
through<00:03:05.090> your<00:03:05.500> aquarium<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.640> basically<00:03:07.910> a

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
through your aquarium so basically a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.550 
through your aquarium so basically a
micro<00:03:08.300> bubbles<00:03:08.450> don't<00:03:08.750> really<00:03:09.140> affect<00:03:09.230> that

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
micro bubbles don't really affect that

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.710 
micro bubbles don't really affect that
fish<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:09.950> much<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:11.210> find<00:03:11.420> them<00:03:11.510> annoying

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
fish that much I just find them annoying

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.480 
fish that much I just find them annoying
because<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.290> like<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.740> like<00:03:13.070> nice

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
because I like to have like nice

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.120 
because I like to have like nice
crystal-clear<00:03:14.090> water<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.830> micro

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
crystal-clear water and the micro

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.620 
crystal-clear water and the micro
bubbles<00:03:16.250> will<00:03:16.520> avoid<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:18.230> horizontal

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
bubbles will avoid that so horizontal

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.940 
bubbles will avoid that so horizontal
distribution<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.720> oxygen<00:03:21.170> meaning<00:03:21.830> you've

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
distribution of oxygen meaning you've

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.800 
distribution of oxygen meaning you've
got<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.070> pump<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.580> agitates<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.270> top<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.690> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
got a pump that agitates the top of the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.650 
got a pump that agitates the top of the
water<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.350> by<00:03:25.250> far<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.550> most<00:03:25.880> effective<00:03:26.480> way

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
water is by far the most effective way

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.690 
water is by far the most effective way
of<00:03:26.690> doing<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.160> definitely<00:03:28.370> have

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
of doing it you can definitely have

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.400 
of doing it you can definitely have
combinations<00:03:29.420> where<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.720> have<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> pump<00:03:30.230> and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
combinations where you have the pump and

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.430 
combinations where you have the pump and
you<00:03:31.220> have<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.550> air<00:03:31.700> stone<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.330> lot<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.140> people

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
you have the air stone a lot of people

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.340 
you have the air stone a lot of people
like<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.860> air<00:03:33.980> stone<00:03:34.280> for<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.640> look<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:35.060> it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
like the air stone for the look that it

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.970 
like the air stone for the look that it
creates<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.790> once<00:03:38.000> again<00:03:38.150> for<00:03:38.810> freshwater<00:03:39.080> air

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
creates so once again for freshwater air

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.550 
creates so once again for freshwater air
stones<00:03:40.430> are<00:03:40.640> totally<00:03:41.030> acceptable<00:03:41.560> for

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
stones are totally acceptable for

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.940 
stones are totally acceptable for
saltwater<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.730> think<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.120> um<00:03:44.950> water

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
saltwater I really think that um water

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.690 
saltwater I really think that um water
pumps<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.550> go<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.050> situations<00:03:48.050> like<00:03:48.260> this

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
pumps of the go so situations like this

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.160 
pumps of the go so situations like this
with<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.850> pump<00:03:50.150> there<00:03:50.360> which<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.630> magnitude

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
with that pump there which is magnitude

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.050 
with that pump there which is magnitude
to<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.410> back<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.739> aquarium<00:03:51.950> called<00:03:52.820> an<00:03:52.910> a

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
to the back of the aquarium called an a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.420 
to the back of the aquarium called an a
coral<00:03:53.390> reef<00:03:53.480> circulator<00:03:56.590> 2600<00:03:57.590> that<00:03:58.190> thing

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
coral reef circulator 2600 that thing

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.449 
coral reef circulator 2600 that thing
only<00:03:58.550> runs<00:03:58.880> on<00:03:59.090> four<00:03:59.420> watts<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.260> would<00:04:01.040> be<00:04:01.220> my

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
only runs on four watts and would be my

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.870 
only runs on four watts and would be my
a<00:04:01.730> very<00:04:02.540> economical<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:03.350> buy<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.489> run<00:04:04.670> so

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
a very economical to buy and to run so

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.550 
a very economical to buy and to run so
that<00:04:05.030> would<00:04:05.180> be<00:04:05.330> my<00:04:05.480> favourite<00:04:05.930> choice<00:04:06.140> and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
that would be my favourite choice and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.009 
that would be my favourite choice and
aim<00:04:07.190> slightly<00:04:07.820> up<00:04:07.970> like<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.360> one<00:04:08.600> so<00:04:08.870> it's

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
aim slightly up like this one so it's

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.320 
aim slightly up like this one so it's
getting<00:04:09.200> plenty<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.680> surface<00:04:09.890> agitation<00:04:10.700> so

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
getting plenty of surface agitation so

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.090 
getting plenty of surface agitation so
I've<00:04:11.450> got<00:04:11.630> very<00:04:11.870> low<00:04:12.050> surface<00:04:12.350> tension<00:04:12.950> so

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
I've got very low surface tension so

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.340 
I've got very low surface tension so
I've<00:04:13.640> got<00:04:13.790> heaps<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.480> oxygen<00:04:14.989> in<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.140> water

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
I've got heaps of oxygen in the water

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.500 
I've got heaps of oxygen in the water
that<00:04:15.680> would<00:04:16.130> be<00:04:16.310> my<00:04:16.459> first<00:04:16.730> choice<00:04:17.090> for<00:04:17.120> both

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
that would be my first choice for both

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.200 
that would be my first choice for both
freshwater<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.440> saltwater<00:04:19.280> aquariums<00:04:20.000> and

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
freshwater and saltwater aquariums and

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.890 
freshwater and saltwater aquariums and
those<00:04:20.539> pumps<00:04:20.960> don't<00:04:21.140> heat<00:04:21.530> up<00:04:21.710> at<00:04:21.919> all<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.630> over

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
those pumps don't heat up at all so over

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.030 
those pumps don't heat up at all so over
here

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
here

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.470 
here
again<00:04:25.340> we've<00:04:25.520> got<00:04:25.610> some<00:04:25.790> bubbles<00:04:25.940> coming<00:04:26.420> out

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
again we've got some bubbles coming out

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.360 
again we've got some bubbles coming out
here<00:04:27.020> we've<00:04:27.530> got<00:04:27.680> very<00:04:27.920> good<00:04:27.980> surface

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
here we've got very good surface

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.270 
here we've got very good surface
agitation<00:04:29.120> here<00:04:29.530> then<00:04:30.530> over<00:04:30.830> here<00:04:30.860> we've<00:04:31.160> got

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
agitation here then over here we've got

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.910 
agitation here then over here we've got
the<00:04:31.400> return<00:04:31.730> pump<00:04:32.230> that's<00:04:33.230> blistering<00:04:33.800> out

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
the return pump that's blistering out

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.800 
the return pump that's blistering out
over<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.490> very<00:04:35.030> very<00:04:35.300> good<00:04:35.570> surface

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
over here so very very good surface

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.580 
over here so very very good surface
agitation<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:38.210> horizontal<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.230> best<00:04:39.410> way

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
agitation so horizontal is the best way

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.260 
agitation so horizontal is the best way
of<00:04:39.620> providing<00:04:40.070> surface<00:04:40.610> agitation<00:04:41.240> and

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
of providing surface agitation and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.170 
of providing surface agitation and
vertical<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.360> also<00:04:44.690> an<00:04:44.810> option<00:04:45.730> so<00:04:46.730> 14<00:04:47.150> times

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
vertical is also an option so 14 times

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.220 
vertical is also an option so 14 times
an<00:04:47.570> hour<00:04:47.690> for<00:04:47.990> saltwater<00:04:48.260> aquariums<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:50.230> sort

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
an hour for saltwater aquariums and sort

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.090 
an hour for saltwater aquariums and sort
of<00:04:51.260> at<00:04:51.380> least<00:04:51.530> six<00:04:51.980> times<00:04:52.190> now<00:04:52.550> for<00:04:54.100> freshwater

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
of at least six times now for freshwater

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.410 
of at least six times now for freshwater
aquariums<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.710> stay<00:04:57.710> away<00:04:58.010> from<00:04:58.040> air<00:04:58.880> stones

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
aquariums and stay away from air stones

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.110 
aquariums and stay away from air stones
in<00:04:59.840> saltwater<00:05:00.260> so<00:05:01.160> once<00:05:01.370> again<00:05:01.490> if<00:05:01.820> your<00:05:01.940> air

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
in saltwater so once again if your air

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.450 
in saltwater so once again if your air
stone<00:05:02.390> is<00:05:02.630> actually<00:05:03.200> able<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.620> go<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
stone is actually able to go to the

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.670 
stone is actually able to go to the
surface<00:05:04.700> like<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.420> pop<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:05.870> means<00:05:06.470> you

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
surface like that and pop that means you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.470 
surface like that and pop that means you
do<00:05:06.860> not<00:05:06.890> have<00:05:07.430> enough<00:05:07.670> water<00:05:07.730> flow<00:05:08.180> in<00:05:08.360> your

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
do not have enough water flow in your

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.970 
do not have enough water flow in your
aquarium<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.140> I<00:05:09.650> would<00:05:09.920> recommend<00:05:10.160> adding<00:05:10.940> a

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
aquarium and I would recommend adding a

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.430 
aquarium and I would recommend adding a
pump<00:05:12.980> like<00:05:13.190> this
