00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 in this regatta sure today we 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.960
 are in a nursery the nurseries 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.670
 of saint lambert near attigny then 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.290
 saint lambert in the department of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 ardennes on the crests prÃ©ardennaises 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.219
 we have a professional with us a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 nurseryman who engages in transplantation 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.750
 crown and we'll see together how 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.180
 do we do to graft crown 25 15 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 because I put 21 10 and there is 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.090
 added refers you to how it is 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.489
 face to face have yielded these are 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.050
 varieties that old varieties that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.960
 people or do not necessarily know 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.000
 no and they want to keep this variety 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.489
 for different reasons it's 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.430
 just a sentimental reasons the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.260
 caylar of grandfather or grandmother 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 sarah because mister pie opens 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.489
 the cake as we say in the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 ardennes and the nurseryman grafts him 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.730
 as a professional who is not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 exceptional in the eyes of people it is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.969
 a variety that they amateurs come to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 to lead then that's how people 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.519
 find exactly the same variety 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.519
 that they were going 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.240
 yes if I 'm going to prune the grafts so 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.610
 these grafts preserved them we cut 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.740
 branches at month two months of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.820
 january that's why the buds 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 are not starting at all and has 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.570
 preserved in sand to the northeast 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.729
 then well now we're going to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.880
 grafted so we make coffee without 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.110
 crown and have made a simple one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.810
 graph in crown is a simple kiss 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 here we see well here it is clear 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.409
 we will do it 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 improve it a little bit that's all for 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.360
 we have better contact with the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.500
 rootstock 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.539
 we leave 5 buds and then we go 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.220
 to pose on the graft 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.670
 then the rootstock is what the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.869
 rootstock it's a here it's a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.159
 intermediate so that's a variety of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.340
 plum tree that grows well right 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:13.170
 and then that was grafted in escutcheon it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.380
 two years ago now we're doing a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.739
 feint a simple cleft have some corsican 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.079
 we will lift a little bit here 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:27.780
 which will allow to drag the graft 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:32.940
 between the corsican and the woods this is it 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.070
 it's just finished I 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.900
 put the adhesive vigan so that the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.180
 graft can take into account the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.070
 rootstock is tight this is good 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.070
 well here it is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 so we put putty 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.890
 so the rest has grafted mosquitoes had 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.670
 done to hide all the peel we 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:06.000
 did for patty between yedder 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.750
 let's graft a graft 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 the strike is over 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.350
 so we do crown grafting 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.510
 quite late in the season because precisely 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.220
 the bodies yelle the acef in the door 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.930
 transplant that helps take off Scotland 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.160
 we could not take off Corsican 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.080
 in January because we would not have 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.120
 no sap yet in the portrait 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.730
 and then a term in time women 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.720
 and at 8 15 May 15 we are a little bit 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.190
 late this year but so when that 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.250
 done on May 15th this is what is 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.770
 important is also the weather 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.810
 must be nice yes way when he 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.750
 has excluded from transplant and when he is 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.360
 happy when it rains as well from the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.830
 cleft-cleft graft that the 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.110
 cif discussed during the summer 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.600
 meadow you are beautiful you are beautiful in everything 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.350
 that's a job we need 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.350
 order the weather
