00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
exactly how it started well where we

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
exactly how it started well where we
showed<00:01:16.259> those<00:01:16.439> guys<00:01:16.650> arguing<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.250> that

showed those guys arguing about that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
showed those guys arguing about that
space<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.320> chicane

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
space up there was in the the chicane

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
space up there was in the the chicane
enter<00:01:20.460> loop<00:01:20.670> part<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> racetrack<00:01:21.869> at

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
enter loop part of the the racetrack at

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
enter loop part of the the racetrack at
the<00:01:22.140> bus<00:01:22.320> stop<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.640> coming

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the bus stop there and this was coming

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.529 
the bus stop there and this was coming
out<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.909> only<00:01:27.030> speculate

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
out of there so we can only speculate

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.480 
out of there so we can only speculate
but<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.830> something<00:01:29.070> along

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
but got to think that something along

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.969 
but got to think that something along
those<00:01:29.670> lines<00:01:29.789> took<00:01:30.299> place<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.680> feeling

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
those lines took place I have a feeling

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
those lines took place I have a feeling
think<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.520> drove<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:32.970> racetrack

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
think you just drove off the racetrack

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
think you just drove off the racetrack
into<00:01:33.780> those<00:01:33.899> tires<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> feeling<00:01:35.549> Joey

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
into those tires I have a feeling Joey

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
into those tires I have a feeling Joey
