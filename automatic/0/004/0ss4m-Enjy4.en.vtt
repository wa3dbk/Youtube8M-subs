00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
there so yeah because you're you're much

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
there so yeah because you're you're much
more<00:01:04.799> popular<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.220> Europe<00:01:06.119> than<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
more popular in Europe than in the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.370 
more popular in Europe than in the
United<00:01:07.020> States<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:09.600> music<00:01:09.990> scene<00:01:10.200> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
United States I think the music scene in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
United States I think the music scene in
the<00:01:10.409> States<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.860> much<00:01:11.490> smaller<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.119> like

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
hardcore punk and stuff like that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.530
