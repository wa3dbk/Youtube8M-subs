00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.959
 because then they fight with this new Bochum guy with these new ones 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.129
 Expressions that he likes them with selects AP when they overhear the biometric 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.629
 risk 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.629
 of income for lack of longevity 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.609
 this spontaneous is for the speech 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.000
 the biometric risk of income due to longevity 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.019
 that sounds like a novel beginning of GÃ¼nter Grass 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.019
 January is from Europ 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.929
 At the age of 4 you did not succeed in tearing enough language for old-age poverty 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.330
 great or 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.860
 there must be so many new ones from Doveren 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.600
 because in the lower classes say we get different 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 discriminating, too clear 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.350
 Wisniewski precariat say 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.630
 they do not have precariat dynamite the underclass does not notice if we over 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.180
 to speak 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.080
 they are not allowed to cover anymore or say idiots they have to say who 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.560
 Destroy Lungs 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.370
 d 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.880
 that is very elegant from the label and its layers there is no other one in this one 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.540
 is there income loss then i 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.580
 and whoever talks like that is not stupid he is mentally challenged 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.750
 in times when workers are no longer dismissed or released 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.390
 He extremely mentally challenged employees 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.490
 earlier when the impossible was called the impossible one used to call it the impossible 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.080
 Squaring the circle 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.310
 today the first grand coalition 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.079
 After that, the latte makes meaningful compromises, as should a footballer go 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.180
 Handballer could not agree on which part of the body you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.760
 can not touch over 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 or that one must then decide his sport or 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600
 there are so many there is no compromise minimum wage what should there 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.000
 Compromises either make them go for people to work 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.330
 So they can either live on the reward they get 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.970
 Minimum wage or her south asshole 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 OK but combative 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.630
 In the end, change must also be said so I say honestly 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.710
 even to offer 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.510
 we do not say that clean singing housewife 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.140
 Rank we say always say that parliamentary democracy 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.620
 and who for the new price target for Roth the register social pack 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.729
 Nokia 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.729
 but still the ashes here 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.409
 about location for the eye of the educational distance 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.789
 because Nokia fulfills his task 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.109
 The job of Nokia is not to create jobs or to 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.149
 The task of Nokia is to provide for that 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:38.329
 Nokia shares the biometrics as they are short on Gomez for lack of succession 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.129
 demand eternity to minimize 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.129
 that is the task explained 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.359
 we have this is demographic problems Germany the German 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.929
 that's pretty much the worst thing to happen 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.879
 what else can happen to the planet before the climate catastrophe 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.040
 Willi German abroad, the Africans already said as the Germans about 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.439
 Silver only became spatial 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.589
 The Swiss see completely different way by the way 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.139
 the Swiss say I want the German death house she clearly continues saying it 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.649
 there are too many Germans in Switzerland Herten in Switzerland could talk 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.790
 Percent say that there is an alienation from too many German in 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:20.679
 Switzerland 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.679
 which hinted practically in Switzerland the dead 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.389
 especially about the two colleagues now comes the chef from Switzerland
