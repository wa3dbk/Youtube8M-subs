00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.919
 hello good data friends welcome a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.749
 time more to my channel this time heading 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.610
 infected let's talk about this way of 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:11.100
 game but first of all I have to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.350
 tell you a couple of things the first will be 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.270
 a silent phone will be afa love that I leave you 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.800
 the doubt is a good departure for that reason what 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.529
 I say so you can also look at the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 gameplay and the second thing I wanted 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 say it is being cut to half the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 game because it was just the game is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.409
 a good sex you have a strip cables like that 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.970
 which is therefore going to cut a 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.340
 little bit in the middle but nothing happens 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.590
 can hardly be appreciated just in case 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 some smartass and if you appreciate it is worth 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.699
 that does not give good importance 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 let's talk about the modified and lies 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.109
 zero is a question to you as 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.629
 you play this game mode it's worth it 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.269
 there are different ways to play it and I 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.910
 I think the best thing is with friends and have 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.190
 a clear strategy how bad I 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 I usually get together with the most bosses 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.019
 that are a couple of colleagues and we always 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.839
 they end up killing and we have never taken 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.249
 a woman cleans a day for the illusion 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.780
 I had made them we were did the trick 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.970
 of the insertion you want it to be since 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.800
 attentive happy but really getting out 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.230
 Grace 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.210
 we have never taken out we just did it is a 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.760
 once again it must be said and good 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.080
 I wanted to talk to you about how to play this 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.910
 game mode because there are two ways to 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.970
 play it right now as you are watching 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.190
 I'm playing phrases or 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.200
 good to copaco is unimportant 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.690
 really and if the departure of yes no 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.140
 can you have fun having fun 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.760
 to enemies normally in this mode 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.560
 more than looking for you at 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.650
 enemies want you to be found 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.210
 so at the end of the game, more or 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.620
 less good a little later you will see 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.540
 how do I stay in a fixed place because 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.870
 they all come to me I say what am I going to 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.090
 go if they are going to come 5 or 6 and they are going to 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.950
 kill clearly then that is one aspect 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.600
 I wanted to try because in this game 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.610
 in this mode play that have a lot 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.860
 be careful because then because they have a 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 throwing knife that some can 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.930
 get lucky and kill you to take it for ass 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.880
 and you also have forgiveness of the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.740
 infected the tactical knife and already 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.480
 you know that I already tried this topic 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.010
 previously 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.620
 in this game the command is 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.900
 incorporated and with tactical knife is already 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.190
 the chaos because they kill you even if you're 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.800
 quite far, they kill you 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.860
 unfortunately several and good as 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.830
 you are seeing around here I already have as the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.900
 fixed area is worth here I've already fixed 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.550
 where the enemies come to me and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.500
 I see that they go up to the allies to 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.120
 them and I say good then then already 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.330
 we know what we have to do good 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.370
 here the game will be cut as you see 543 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.020
 etcetera and well here the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.970
 game and I see that the enemies come 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.770
 here this I do not know if to call it campeÃ³ 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.210
 because it really is to stay at a point 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.460
 fixed waiting for others to come 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.990
 I believe that camps is as if I fix 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.280
 on the map are all those behind 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.890
 of me waiting for him to come but 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.510
 we do not leave it and of course I do 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.070
 I was nervous is saying good to me 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.140
 I'm going to take out the fashion it looks like 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.970
 pretty clear they do not have knives 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.680
 thrown because I'm covering me with 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.450
 the car if everything does not go wrong the case 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.850
 is this I'm out of vouchers and I do not 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 you fuck I run out of bullets bad stuff 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.960
 plus another good I take off the magnum 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.450
 etcetera and taking advantage of this 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.220
 this court also wanted to say to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.470
 what weapons do you also consider 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.600
 not to get us out of fashion I think that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.910
 the best weapons or not the stryker or the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.760
 type 95 before the app 90 and then other 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.830
 weapons like the current barreto that 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.020
 they have the barrier I do not know exactly how 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.850
 they are called and good as you see here bad 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.420
 I'm lucky I think I think I remember 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.890
 two had 23 x I have 2 left 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 I had a hard line and I had one left but 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.540
 good and what I said I told a variant 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.910
 which is the adhered rasa saco for city 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.130
 another variant would be to stay in seated 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.800
 Well, with colleagues or without colleagues, 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.940
 character is where they are 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.010
 saying good let's wait for 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.750
 come that we are five here is going to be 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.270
 quite difficult that they notice me as 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.100
 better I'm lucky but there are maps like 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.630
 for example I think it's arcade in 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.250
 the mall that everyone is 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.840
 Be left behind the burger guard 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.550
 they are going to give for eggs you are not going to take out 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.990
 there the masita you take it out I think it's 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.450
 quite difficult I think that there you 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.860
 You get specialist and thank you as much 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.390
 important I think it's going a bit 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.410
 back and then hold the position that 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.720
 is what I have done but in this case 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.830
 I had bad luck in the game and good 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.410
 here you will see what 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.590
 of death I'm going to make sure you take it now 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.630
 that throws says I just nailed and 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.920
 good people I hope you liked it 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.660
 I hope that in your comments as 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.340
 judge you the infected way that we 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.560
 will help everyone quite a lot 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.820
 thanks for how the channel is going and 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.810
 see you in the next one that I employ and 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.810
 Greetings and see you next time
