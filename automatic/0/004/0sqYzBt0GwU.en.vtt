00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
interesting thing about this to me is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
interesting thing about this to me is
the<00:01:04.619> fact<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> he<00:01:05.010> says<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> anti-hero

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the fact that he says the anti-hero

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
the fact that he says the anti-hero
which<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> something<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:07.979> Black

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
mean he was mostly a black and white

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.850

bill<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.140> most<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.710> did

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bill and for most of that but they did

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.039 
bill and for most of that but they did
give<00:01:26.070> him<00:01:26.250> some<00:01:26.520> motives<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.030> reasoning<00:01:27.450> more

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
give him some motives and reasoning more

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
give him some motives and reasoning more
than<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.530> man<00:01:28.790> Superman<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:30.030> did
