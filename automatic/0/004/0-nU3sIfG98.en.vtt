00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 when you sit at your desk 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.890
 there quickly a socket needs because 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.509
 a laptop ley is or you just yours 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 you have to load the phone 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.889
 Same problem as me too 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 there are no nice ones 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.559
 power strips now you have several 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.370
 possibilities either he lays down 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.080
 simply not standard 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.789
 multiple sockets on yours 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 desk laid the cable across 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.490
 through the room, or if he so a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 extension cable on your 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 desk I see all the solutions 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.410
 they are especially great and practical 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.660
 not really either 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.720
 That's why it's about power today 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 cubana lockenkopf today it works 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 around a power strip the thing has 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.140
 on a dice surface of the power cable 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.820
 on four cube surfaces in sockets 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.410
 connections of which three are usable 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.870
 and on the last cube, two 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.820
 USB ports all 2.1 amps 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.610
 that also means that can spend 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.770
 this weird usb power supply will fall off 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.180
 somehow always microbe and lie 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.559
 if you ask yourself why it falls 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.210
 actually a socket connection 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 way, well , somehow the thing has to be yes 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 also on your desk 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.399
 for this a funny little football 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 put in that with a lot of violence in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.239
 a socket connection purely 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 must unscrew and then with solid 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 supplied adhesive tape on your 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 fix your desk if you can 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.470
 Now panic has about your electricity bill 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 I can reassure you though two 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 usb connectors are installed pulls the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.840
 power cube 0 watts if nothing 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 is inserted so at least says 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 My electricity meter is the only one 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 Criticism I really found 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 have that been quite strong and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.250
 thick cable but what then 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 bearable is all in all 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 her for under 20 euros a very 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 he also dices practical plugs 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.630
 An Amazon link looks extremely good 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.159
 Of course you can find it in below 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 the video description 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.130
 you have a completely different solution for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.899
 this sound problem or fandet 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.219
 just write the video great then write 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.659
 but just a comment or gives 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.600
