00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:15.909
 we are at the beginning of a new era in the drive technology of vehicles 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.309
 Here is an overview from today until tomorrow the criticism you chief technician 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.009
 At present we already have alternatives as has often been part of 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.899
 Trilogy witnessed so Fire River Gold Corp. 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.999
 Hybrid vehicles and gas supplier market 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.149
 in the near future, the editor will have vehicles on the market and if Werner 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.149
 Hydrogen and fuel cells on 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.150
 an existing alternative Silver Trust vehicles 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.480
 We already have more than 3000 vehicles on the Austrian market 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.530
 around 250 gas stations 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.390
 where you can refuel natural gas 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 the advantage is the lower emissions especially for co2 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.590
 then disadvantage 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 higher acquisition costs and the vehicle offer is still somewhat successful 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 there is a kind of code of alternative with prospects for the future 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.350
 Hybrid vehicles shot from the area over their series turned to the 1 6 Bender 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.140
 with all its advantages and disadvantages one can 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.450
 big distances 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.479
 more or less long distances drive electrically on the other side 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.259
 but has the disadvantage that makes my second Andrew the day before to the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.000
 Mountain routes at high speed 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.120
 extra ballast on the power tabs and more off 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.120
 Consumer prices have also been without a hybrid 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.229
 That's what a car battery looks like in the future 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.290
 Electric vehicles that have many times honored at 12 these batteries on board 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.430
 we are already at the problem 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.310
 the extra weight the batteries will weigh several hundred kilos 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.070
 Interrupting it is relatively high up to ten thousand euros 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.200
 Nevertheless, the electric vehicles will be an alternative for the future 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.760
 less electricity can alternatively be generated environmentally friendly 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.960
 they make a good contract for the relief of the environment and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 reduce consumption at the same time 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.199
 very environmentally friendly alternative is the fuel cell 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.660
 the big advantage there is no emissions 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.720
 by the fuel cell the big disadvantage one needs hydrogen for 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.759
 the company 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.909
 Knight Hydrogen must be produced in large quantities 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.319
 currently not environmentally friendly 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.609
 and a hydrogen filling station network, too 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:30.539
 be there 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.340
 Price go all developments in this direction 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.349
 if you look at female fuel cell reduction in the future 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.999
 has two crime scenes 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.910
 all drive alternatives 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.669
 League South occupied 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.889
 Prof virop fuel cell We will become electric hydrogen in the future 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:52.040
 to achieve a significant relief for gasoline and diesel 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.810
 and also in the future only for traffic
