00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
 today I want to start this video sent a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.469
 greetings to lords love to la lore ya 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.240
 Claudia Landaveri who left me a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.860
 comment asking for more crafts 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.539
 recycling and sent me a greeting from 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 peru well thank you very much for your 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.500
 greeting and with your request to mind today I 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.300
 I bring this video that is about 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.950
 recycle the cans eyebrows that we have left 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 everywhere and that I have two ideas 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.490
 for idea number 1 we need a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.050
 large and smaller ones can the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.460
 small are tuna fish and if you want to know 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.500
 how to remove the smell that I leave in the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.270
 video information too 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.030
 we need paper to decorate our 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.460
 cans if you notice the cans have 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.220
 a small edge and when putting the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.260
 paper the edge is seen through the paper 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.930
 If you do not care, you can leave it like that 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.910
 but if you like you can do like me and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.250
 put a cardboard strip around the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 can this board is thick as 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 the cereal boxes 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.680
 and it looks perfect like the same level 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.700
 of the can already the edge is no longer seen so much 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.700
 rather it is no longer seen 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.910
 stick the cardboard strip around the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.220
 can you help with a little bit of 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.840
 tape to help the cardboard to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 stay in place in what dries 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.530
 then decorate it on the outside with the paper 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.530
 that you have chosen 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.359
 and also decorate it inside 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.000
 to add a little more detail 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.000
 I'm going to use one of these scissors 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 they have the edge as well as with different 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.940
 figures I'm going to use this paper that is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.760
 I metallic gray metal and it makes me 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.660
 the combination between pink and gray or silver 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 It looks super nice 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.319
 for the bottom of the can I put a circle 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 which is from fomi but you can use fabric 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.370
 or paper 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.100
 and for decoration I'm going to put a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.870
 plastic gem decorates your other cans and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.780
 that's how they should stay and that's how it is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.590
 how it should not stay because after 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.590
 you have a lot to clean 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.560
 Now that you have decorated the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.680
 let's hit one with another one side 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.780
 place the way you want in my case 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.550
 I'm going to put them as a ladder but 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.500
 you can put them as you want everything 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.760
 around you can put two then with the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.760
 3/4 whatever you want 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.550
 and continuing with the issue of recycling if 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.650
 you do not have these these little balls is 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.090
 plastic burns you can see the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 video that I made of the butterflies of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.150
 plastic that are made with the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.100
 recycled plastic that ended for the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.990
 trash you just paint it does this 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.390
 figure that you want and walt recycles if you 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.760
 serves as decoration to locate them as 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.590
 you want to stick them and let it dry very 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.100
 well before moving them that's how I 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.100
 is mine 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.050
 avoid already liking this idea and obviously 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.780
 if it resists if it stays in its place but 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.860
 you are going to put very heavy things for 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.630
 the idea number 2 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.730
 I'll teach you first how to power 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.190
 make the holes in the cans of a 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.770
 very easy way and that the cans do not 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.630
 they lose their shape 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.760
 with something inside that stays in its 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.960
 place and if you can not help with a 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.060
 little sticky tape 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.290
 and you will find it very easy to cross the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.350
 can with the nail 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.490
 then you need a piece of wood 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.140
 that covers the plate that will be used 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:00.400
 in this case I am going to use 2 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.400
 painting if you like 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.160
 and then decorate your cans once more 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.590
 I'm going to use paper because I like the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.360
 decoration of this paper 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.400
 but you can use paint too 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.010
 but for the use I'm going to give you my 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.419
 paper for me is perfect and I'm going 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.419
 to join simply with adhesive tape 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.440
 and I'll tell you why you chose Color 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.970
 because I had a belt and it 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.220
 broke and the one in this color that's fine 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.260
 nice because I want to never reuse it 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.050
 you know what the 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.180
 things so do not throw everything 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.620
 It will serve as a handle for 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.379
 to be able to take my letters from a place to 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.419
 other that yes the glue that I'm going to 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.729
 use here is a bit strong because 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.650
 I do not want everything to fall apart and while 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.060
 the glue dries I'm going to put this is 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.069
 a tack or thumbtack I think 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.659
 it is also called for decoration and 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:00.150
 obviously to keep the belt in 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.150
 its place or in this case the handle 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.870
 Now we need four screws that 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.510
 are more or less the thickness of the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.580
 little board that we are using and with the 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.470
 pencil marks the hole you made 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.610
 first with the nail to know where 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.610
 are you going to put the screw 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.220
 first locate it and make the path with 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.200
 the screw and with the screwdriver so that 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.910
 easier after you put the can 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.760
 I recommend doing the four first 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.950
 holes and then locate them 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.710
 screw the screw inside 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.740
 then locate it in the wood locate your 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.449
 beats in the wood rather 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.000
 and face as much as you can with your 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.169
 hand and then with your screwdriver is 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.030
 a little bit difficult that's why I recommend you 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.289
 that the hole is not so far down 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.289
 so you can spin it 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.159
 and finally I'm going to put you 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.020
 cachuelas which I remove in the 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.360
 tip be very careful you're going to 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.319
 remove because the tip flies by all 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.319
 sides and is very dangerous 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.880
 and that is how it is in the end I put them 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.860
 white paper before putting the screw 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.610
 I did not record it but I put white paper 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.620
 so they are short 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.599
 Well, those are friends and some are expected 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.520
 of them you liked let me know 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.199
 Which one did you like the most 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.150
 do not forget to subscribe if you already did 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.830
 thank you very much I also recommend you 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.810
 see the list of recycling videos that 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.550
 I have already know that we tell you of good 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.550
 nice and see you in the next video
