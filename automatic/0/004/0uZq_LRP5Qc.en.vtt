00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.479
 Follow 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 tan 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 anglo 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:01.800
 ana 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:03.790
 in cm 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.580
 There is such a thing 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.290
 Primary secondary 3 from the 5th fret 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.610
 Yeah 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.610
 Ehsan's game 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.990
 The rest is no 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.630
 par 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 I have this 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.840
 3 or less 15 frets 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.040
 Or 11 less fret 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.409
 Either way 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.710
 So I like this 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.760
 3 cases 15 frets 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.450
 choking 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.820
 It's pretty hard, is n't it ? 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:53.700
 It may not go to here The finger may only go this 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.909
 But Choking that is in such a feeling 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.310
 This is the hammering 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:07.130
 Though it is such a high quality, high hammering is not twice 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.130
 The first time is the second ring of the chalking is the sale ring 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.340
 This is 65 out of 2 houses 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.930
 pa 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.930
 car 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.769
 The last one is 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 It started with f minor because it's a f minor song 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.940
 Because f minor last does 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.940
 w 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.190
 It is one fret of 6 strings 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.710
 Around here 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 If you look around here , it looks like it 's kinda cool and old-fashioned and royal 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.700
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.850
 Even if I play around here, I can play some phrases 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.120
 And pull in Oru little bridge child of Tteyuu 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.840
 Hmmm 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.840
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.950
 This time when there is only one 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:27.319
 Sometimes I can hear this 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.319
 It is not also not the feel Well makes the little I mean now point of view
