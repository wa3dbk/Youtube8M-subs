00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.730
 Hello dear you, I love you Benzins Mintec professionals this time with one again 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.679
 small cage key the function which I will introduce now and one notices 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.369
 Easter 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.380
 should be known to protect the old Mac lawn 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.090
 Nevertheless, it shows up because there are certainly new mac-user BZ what users 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.630
 the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.250
 only this feature is not 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.740
 one that is also a bit hidden is an operating system and said 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.650
 not directly 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.970
 apparent 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.720
 it's about what I mean 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.570
 on Beckett or start up at a certain time 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.100
 our time 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.880
 the same too as I leave my Mac down respectively 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.090
 sleep at a certain time 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.490
 how to do that is easy 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.820
 you go to system settings 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.700
 Here you choose to save energy 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.850
 there was a godfather here in the Geeste 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 that is time spent 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.080
 because you only get up 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.340
 and here you can see 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.490
 2 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.510
 Things that you can click on and even stop states or hibernation 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.440
 I'll agree on that 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.080
 there are then more choices and then 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 Weekdays at the words weekends 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.900
 every day on Tuesdays 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.350
 Wednesdays Thursdays and so on how to choose when the whole 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.330
 should take place and of course the time that means if you are here for 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.040
 Example on Monday 37 enters the bend Mac 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.070
 On Mondays every Monday to the 37 high quality or the hibernation finished 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.109
 That's nice if you for example 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.679
 Mother to 37 is always under Meg then quickly started up in the 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.999
 Anmarsch makes the emails can look or other things in the morning 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.479
 I do not know what 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.900
 For example, you can switch off correctly at 4 and experience 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.370
 up at the desired time and is-data ready 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.970
 Of course you have to be concerned 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.529
 if you have a password now 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.229
 that you have to enter the login at the moment, it will not be 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.950
 exceed if you do not have a password 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.640
 then he drives right up completely and is ready for use 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.259
 Son the next song that you can put here is either 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:28.589
 Enable hibernation, initiate hall-neustadt or turn off the Mac 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.480
 SG can also be selected again 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.660
 when the whole so on which day the whole should take place and held the 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.059
 Polzei twang should take place 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.759
 so the Mac simply means down to a prescribed percentage 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.919
 or the idle state is activated or restarted 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.989
 Of course you have to be concerned again 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.310
 Programs like Safari and nothing has this warning when closing 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.789
 several taps 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.399
 that has shut down that or shut down in the 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:04.699
 Hibernation or the new states hindered and SMO the Mac is not new 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:05.650
 started 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.159
 BZ what he can be driven under case 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.989
 why do I use this feature, for example 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.219
 if I 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.599
 As I said in my beginning, for example, for tomorrow is mine 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.989
 If I want to have girls then I can just set that up in the morning 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.969
 when I get up and I had to get up in the 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.760
 Hibernation graced the cramped 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.590
 and I do not have to do it right here in its original state 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.149
 So have a nice touch 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.549
 even more important actually it is ready for me iViP 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.990
 when I take a picture 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.030
 Programmers under oath he lies I can just say that my way 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.160
 but what do I know 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.470
 "If I have the state of mind or shut down the walls 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.099
 should 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.569
 ten minutes earlier or so 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.239
 he does that and then the recording starts you have programmed 1 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.300
 really really useful I do not have to have it all the time but have 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.189
 can him too 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.190
 to have closed 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.680
 Under closed gas has closed the display business 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.830
 Roman Mac Book it is only important that an external monitor is connected 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.810
 otherwise if the hibernation is stopped the Apple MacBook covered again 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.939
 goes into the original state 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.259
 these are so use 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.290
 the BIS will 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.579
 and fields 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.469
 the IEC for this feature user 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:21.879
 if you still have other percent suggestions what you do with it or we do that 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.960
 used to write that through in the comments 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.409
 I have to say now that I am now 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.270
 first the next time I will not make any more videos because I'm on Saturday 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.240
 This week I am away and Bocholt has no internet I can on a request 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.930
 "I can not revise yet 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.200
 Example Internet have 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.289
 There must now take the lie 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.909
 So then that too super 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.099
 So what am I supposed to say? I am now calling the spell until I could 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.330
 to teach something new 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.180
 and I want to watch too
