00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
better loot and stuff the second sneak

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.100 
better loot and stuff the second sneak
peek<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.520> archer<00:00:53.879> towers<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
peek is about the archer towers which is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
peek is about the archer towers which is
a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.370> annoying<00:00:56.910> for

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
a little bit a little bit annoying for

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.569 
a little bit a little bit annoying for
me<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:59.090> that<00:01:00.090> means<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:01.160> archer<00:01:02.160> towers

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
me because that means that archer towers

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
me because that means that archer towers
shoots<00:01:03.210> twice<00:01:03.629> faster<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:04.920> still<00:01:05.519> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
shoots twice faster so they still have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.270 
shoots twice faster so they still have
the<00:01:05.880> same<00:01:06.060> damage<00:01:06.390> per<00:01:06.720> second<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.950> they

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the same damage per second but they

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
the same damage per second but they
should<00:01:08.549> twice<00:01:09.270> faster<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> means<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.350> when

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
should twice faster that means that when

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.000 
should twice faster that means that when
i<00:01:11.100> use<00:01:11.430> full<00:01:11.790> Archer<00:01:12.210> champion<00:01:12.720> leagues<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
i use full Archer champion leagues that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820 
i use full Archer champion leagues that
means<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.729> archers<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.390> die<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.900> much

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
means that my archers will die a much

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.210 
means that my archers will die a much
faster<00:01:17.130> than<00:01:17.970> before<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.470> update<00:01:19.950> because

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
faster than before that update because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.609 
faster than before that update because
that<00:01:20.970> means<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.630> archers<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.380> die

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that means that my archers will die

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.210 
that means that my archers will die
twice<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.369> fast<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> means

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
twice as fast which is so that means

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.789 
twice as fast which is so that means
that<00:01:26.490> i'm<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> lose<00:01:27.299> trophies<00:01:27.799> anyways

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that i'm going to lose trophies anyways

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.490 
that i'm going to lose trophies anyways
that's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.939> bit<00:01:30.030> annoying<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.600> now

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that's a little bit annoying but now

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's a little bit annoying but now
