00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
to get some terminologies sorted out

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
to get some terminologies sorted out
let's<00:00:14.580> say<00:00:14.730> you're<00:00:14.910> sitting<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.299> your<00:00:15.480> horse

seeing his inside eyelash or is inside
nostril<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> reason<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.430> calling<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
nostril and the reason I'm calling it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the inside of that neutral position if

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
the inside of that neutral position if
you<00:01:12.930> were<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.260> ask<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.430> minus<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.950> flexion

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you were to ask for a minus one flexion

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.929 
you were to ask for a minus one flexion
and<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:18.979> you're<00:01:19.979> next<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> rail<00:01:20.729> but

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and you're you're next to the rail but

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.820 
and you're you're next to the rail but
your<00:01:21.090> inside<00:01:21.659> leg<00:01:21.930> you're<00:01:22.229> tracking<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
your inside leg you're tracking to the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
your inside leg you're tracking to the
left<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.400> left<00:01:23.790> leg<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> facing<00:01:24.780> toward

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
left so your left leg is facing toward

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
left so your left leg is facing toward
the<00:01:25.080> inside<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.979> ring<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> were<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the inside of the ring so if you were to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.109 
the inside of the ring so if you were to
ask<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.600> minus<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.460> would<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.729> bringing

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
ask for minus one you would be bringing

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.859 
ask for minus one you would be bringing
the<00:01:30.240> horse's<00:01:30.600> head<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.590> inch<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.189> right

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
the horse's head one inch to the right

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.039 
the horse's head one inch to the right
so<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.590> flexion<00:01:35.369> left<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.119> right<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.780> what's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so this flexion left or right is what's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.380 
so this flexion left or right is what's
going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> allow<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> learn<00:01:38.549> an<00:01:38.759> exercise

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
going to allow you to learn an exercise

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.450 
going to allow you to learn an exercise
that<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:40.590> control<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that will give you more control over the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
that will give you more control over the
horse's<00:01:41.909> shoulders<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:42.930> that's<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
horse's shoulders now that's that's the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.069 
horse's shoulders now that's that's the
when<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> talk<00:01:44.939> about<00:01:45.090> flexion<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
when I talk about flexion that's the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
when I talk about flexion that's the
degree<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:46.890> talking<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.340> I'm

bit toward the other hand you don't

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.119 
bit toward the other hand you don't
cross<00:02:45.750> over<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.170> withers<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.859> bring<00:02:46.980> it

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
cross over the withers but you bring it

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.000 
cross over the withers but you bring it
toward<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.639> other<00:02:47.879> hand<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:49.109> that<00:02:49.319> when<00:02:49.799> your

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
toward the other hand so that when your

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.430 
toward the other hand so that when your
hand<00:02:50.549> is<00:02:50.730> turned<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.569> your<00:02:51.750> fingernails<00:02:52.260> are

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
hand is turned and your fingernails are

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.860 
hand is turned and your fingernails are
pointed<00:02:52.799> up<00:02:52.920> toward<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.370> face<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.690> drew

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
pointed up toward your face if you drew

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.899 
pointed up toward your face if you drew
an<00:02:54.959> imaginary<00:02:55.530> diagonal<00:02:56.340> line<00:02:56.519> from<00:02:56.549> your

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
an imaginary diagonal line from your

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.210 
an imaginary diagonal line from your
baby<00:02:57.120> finger<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:58.290> would<00:02:58.439> go<00:02:58.680> toward<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
baby finger it would go toward the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.369 
baby finger it would go toward the
opposite<00:03:00.090> hip<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.629> that's<00:03:00.780> why<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.109> rain

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
opposite hip and that's why that rain

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.530 
opposite hip and that's why that rain
effect<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.950> called<00:03:02.189> an<00:03:02.310> indirect<00:03:03.150> rain

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
effect is called an indirect rain

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.420 
effect is called an indirect rain
because<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> action<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.099> rain<00:03:05.220> goes

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
because the action of the rain goes

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.929 
because the action of the rain goes
toward<00:03:05.760> your<00:03:05.879> opposite<00:03:06.510> hip<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.739> if<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.459> turn

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
toward your opposite hip so if you turn

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.619 
toward your opposite hip so if you turn
one<00:03:08.970> wrist<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.220> support<00:03:12.030> with

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
one wrist like that and you support with

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.899 
one wrist like that and you support with
the<00:03:12.810> other<00:03:13.019> rain<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.159> that<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> horse<00:03:14.639> doesn't

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
the other rain so that the horse doesn't

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.179 
the other rain so that the horse doesn't
Bend<00:03:15.090> its<00:03:15.269> neck<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.139> can<00:03:16.319> get<00:03:16.470> flexion<00:03:16.950> left

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
Bend its neck you can get flexion left

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.819 
Bend its neck you can get flexion left
or<00:03:17.370> flexion<00:03:17.849> right<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.810> as<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.260> learn<00:03:19.590> how<00:03:19.650> to

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
or flexion right so as you learn how to

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.559 
or flexion right so as you learn how to
turn<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.400> horses<00:03:20.639> shoulders<00:03:21.209> that's<00:03:21.419> the

turn the horses shoulders that's the
first<00:03:21.810> thing<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.139> need<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.410> learn<00:03:22.799> how<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.010> do

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
first thing you need to learn how to do

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.159 
first thing you need to learn how to do
how<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.639> flex<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.239> horse<00:03:24.449> at<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.629> pole<00:03:24.870> either

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
all the horse does is closes that space

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.020 
all the horse does is closes that space
between<00:03:45.870> his<00:03:46.560> head<00:03:46.949> and<00:03:47.159> his<00:03:47.370> neck<00:03:47.400> underneath

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
between his head and his neck underneath

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.180 
between his head and his neck underneath
where<00:03:48.659> the<00:03:48.780> throat<00:03:49.019> latches<00:03:49.440> on<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.709> bridle

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
where the throat latches on the bridle

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.949 
where the throat latches on the bridle
so<00:03:50.669> that's<00:03:50.849> not<00:03:51.030> what<00:03:51.180> we're<00:03:51.329> looking<00:03:51.659> for<00:03:51.690> we

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
so that's not what we're looking for we

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.330 
so that's not what we're looking for we
don't<00:03:52.049> want<00:03:52.229> to<00:03:52.290> use<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.590> action<00:03:53.099> of<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
don't want to use that action of the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.369 
don't want to use that action of the
rain<00:03:53.519> where<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.849> wiggle<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.329> fingers<00:03:54.810> you

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
rain where you wiggle your fingers you

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.409 
rain where you wiggle your fingers you
want<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.680> turn<00:03:55.859> your<00:03:56.040> entire<00:03:56.159> wrist<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.239> bring

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
your hand a little bit closer toward the

your hand a little bit closer toward the
other<00:03:59.879> hands<00:04:00.359> here<00:04:00.479> that<00:04:00.720> indirect<00:04:01.199> action

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
other hands here that indirect action

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.629 
other hands here that indirect action
then<00:04:02.970> once<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.199> can<00:04:04.859> position<00:04:05.190> your<00:04:05.400> horse

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
then once you can position your horse

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.189 
then once you can position your horse
either<00:04:05.879> in<00:04:06.510> flexion<00:04:07.169> that's<00:04:07.889> plus<00:04:08.250> one<00:04:08.549> or

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
either in flexion that's plus one or

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.439 
either in flexion that's plus one or
counter<00:04:10.199> flexion<00:04:10.739> that's<00:04:10.919> minus<00:04:11.790> one<00:04:11.940> you

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
counter flexion that's minus one you

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.899 
counter flexion that's minus one you
have<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.379> ability<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:13.889> move<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.430> shoulders

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
have the ability to move the shoulders

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.330 
have the ability to move the shoulders
in<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.150> opposite<00:04:15.690> direction<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.620> let's<00:04:17.190> say

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
in the opposite direction so let's say

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.129 
in the opposite direction so let's say
you're<00:04:17.579> circling<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.239> left<00:04:18.570> which<00:04:18.900> means

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
you're circling to the left which means

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.069 
you're circling to the left which means
your<00:04:19.289> left<00:04:19.500> leg<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.220> inside<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:21.239> you

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
your left leg is on the inside and you

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.959 
your left leg is on the inside and you
wanted<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.380> counter<00:04:22.800> flex<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.250> horse<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.789> with

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
wanted to counter flex the horse so with

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.450 
wanted to counter flex the horse so with
your<00:04:24.150> right<00:04:24.750> wrist<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.560> would<00:04:25.710> unlock<00:04:26.279> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
your right wrist you would unlock the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.410 
your right wrist you would unlock the
door<00:04:26.669> unlock<00:04:27.210> the

door unlock the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.510 
door unlock the
door<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.020> then<00:04:28.710> if<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.980> wanted<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.340> make<00:04:29.490> a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
door and then if you wanted to make a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.010 
door and then if you wanted to make a
corner<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:31.230> would<00:04:31.380> use<00:04:31.590> your<00:04:31.740> two<00:04:32.160> hands<00:04:32.970> as<00:04:33.420> a

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
corner you would use your two hands as a

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.280 
corner you would use your two hands as a
unit<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.850> would<00:04:36.030> take<00:04:36.330> your<00:04:36.510> two<00:04:36.870> hands

bring them in the direction you want to

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.610 
bring them in the direction you want to
turn<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.790> horse's<00:04:42.270> shoulders<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:43.380> if<00:04:43.470> we're

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
turn the horse's shoulders so if we're

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.070 
turn the horse's shoulders so if we're
circling<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.430> left<00:04:44.670> we<00:04:45.330> have<00:04:45.510> right

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
circling to the left we have right

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.260 
circling to the left we have right
flexion<00:04:46.800> -<00:04:47.220> one<00:04:47.400> flexion<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.090> right

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
flexion - one flexion to the right

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.830 
flexion - one flexion to the right
counter<00:04:48.870> flexion<00:04:49.410> your<00:04:50.190> left<00:04:50.640> hand<00:04:51.030> comes<00:04:51.690> to

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
counter flexion your left hand comes to

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.920 
counter flexion your left hand comes to
the<00:04:52.020> left<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.800> your<00:04:52.950> left<00:04:53.250> hip<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.940> your<00:04:54.630> right

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
hand comes very close to the withers so

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.410 
hand comes very close to the withers so
the<00:04:57.480> two<00:04:57.720> hands<00:04:58.170> move<00:04:59.120> equidistant<00:05:00.120> maybe

the two hands move equidistant maybe

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.990 
the two hands move equidistant maybe
three<00:05:00.780> or<00:05:00.810> four<00:05:00.930> inches<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.640> direction

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
you want to lead the shoulders so it's a

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.290 
you want to lead the shoulders so it's a
good<00:05:05.910> way<00:05:06.120> for<00:05:06.150> riders<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.020> learn<00:05:07.650> about
