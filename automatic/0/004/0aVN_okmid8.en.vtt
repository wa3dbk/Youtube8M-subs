00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.340
 vs you have many options for example 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.200
 if you are going to open a new project 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.360
 you can pick up a blank project and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.370
 portal videos and images capture a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 the camera through a camera or the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.580
 your computer screen 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.350
 we go to none of these options where 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.510
 already has a project ready 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 I already showed in other others the video 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.449
 what do we do to cut 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 save etc 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.849
 here in this video specifically we 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 Let's play with some special effects. 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.880
 Let's see what special effects we 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.680
 we have available here 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.899
 here in this bar you can see that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.219
 we already have some available 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 I call special effect despite that 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 in fact are the supplies you can 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.219
 add a rectangle 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.450
 slowly add a rectangle or 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.579
 the entire palette you can place a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 rectangle here in it you can 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.079
 put a text for example suppose 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.920
 you take a text here I want 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.050
 feel watching throughout the video or here 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 put in the whole video come and click 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.760
 on here 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.400
 and said text for example test video 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.189
 which will appear in all of the video 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 she does not like the test video 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.299
 of color does not come here in properties 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 here I can change the color of the text and 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.979
 cosmo from the source of the text for example 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.560
 I can look at it or change it for some 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.850
 The source I found the best and I'll 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.439
 put here is that way here and here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.810
 I can change when the text can 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.259
 put for example brown for example 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.150
 look you see how you have then got 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.250
 how to make some edits right away 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.320
 here you can add music in 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 any moment of the video you can 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.530
 play and show with the moment that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.079
 do you want this text at a time when 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.180
 You do not want to go down. 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.250
 in this video specifically we will see 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 some special effects without being 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.600
 exactly add an object here are 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.040
 the objects that you can add which 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.689
 are the special effects available to us 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.579
 we have several or we will put some 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.170
 here to take the test 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.850
 we are gradually picking up the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.759
 Look, let's go here first, the people. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.759
 will stay here twice in this one right 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.770
 and twice here and so what goes 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 he will open this third 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.800
 here and here you will add the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.350
 effects 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.240
 for example let's little perspective a 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.920
 video and place it on the entire 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.740
 puts it so it will put this 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.430
 I did not like this perspective. 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.690
 I did not want him to be the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.550
 gradually going to another 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.070
 The perspective you can do is 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.980
 play and edith effects right 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.660
 in properties to iacc you add 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.190
 you can put, for example, I do not want 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.830
 this perspective I want it to start from 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.980
 zero and goes up to 30 from start to finish 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.350
 of the video you can do that looks you 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.840
 come here put it at the beginning it goes 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.680
 That way then, look, he'll go. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.820
 increasing the interesting perspective is 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.300
 cool because it dynamizes a little video 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.760
 Let's go another option here, let's go because you 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.790
 want that other option that rotation 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.870
 then the rotation you come here in rotation to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.610
 same thing 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.630
 first let's go there it's in the third 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.240
 band then the rotation and you will place 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.160
 in full video you can rotate 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.720
 Okay, I do not want him to stay. 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.910
 I do not want it to go slowly for you. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.780
 does the same thing on properties and here 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.800
 you can put it from 0 30 for example 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:35.820
 cool play and start from scratch 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:36.690
 look there it goes the rotation and some 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.970
 options 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.350
 really do not know to in comment that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.580
 but sometimes you have to use always 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.110
 appears hand 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.600
 a situation that we will need 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.310
 use it there for speaking in rotation of me 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.560
 asked and in the comments in another 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.150
 video as you do to turn heads 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.320
 down the video is already recorded that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.420
 he works back 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.730
 It's here we click here in 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.800
 green text over 90 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.820
 so here you put it in two ways 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:07.170
 Can you turn it around? 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.580
 head down came back normally not 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.810
 see another option here 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.799
 other effect let's mouth I want this 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.660
 here is skill 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.620
 so I put here that I put in the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.540
 whole wall let's see how it looks 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.430
 He gave 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.080
 Because I did it wrong, it was not going there. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.730
 which I have to do double-click 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:35.300
 in the video here transformes skill 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.560
 on the whole pallet ok people I got 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.990
 too much to figure out what to do 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.090
 this all the time added the effect 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.550
 special and never worked here now 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.240
 it works it 's possible now I want it 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.730
 that those who are little by little also 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.950
 you can play on change properties 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:57.620
 here too the 0 30 and little by little also 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.360
 will do this 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.270
 at first it goes at the same time 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.770
 tilting on one side and on the other goes 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.140
 changing perspective on all sides 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.140
 video looks really cool 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.260
 so we have in other effects also 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.970
 huh 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.680
 we will see that another effect here in the 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.960
 Some truth, I am too. 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.640
 Knowing I like to share 5 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.890
 learn because I think people 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.190
 They will help us to discover new 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.640
 ways we use this video 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.520
 publisher of another option applied two 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:39.230
 times here always look at the third guide 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.820
 we zoom here I applied that in the 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.280
 It decreases, so it 's because you 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.350
 have to navigate to configure that comes here 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.120
 in setting up what will happen 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.390
 the video has decreased so you have to 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.370
 configure in a way that eliminates them 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.000
 for 70 but can only be put through 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.780
 example I want from 100 to 150 per 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:08.690
 example increase or decrease 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:10.730
 so stay here and increase it with the 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.900
 situation that I will use you will know 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.570
 What situation are you going to use? 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.920
 this kind of effect is actually only 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.540
 I'm showing you what effects are 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.410
 available here nor available 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.540
 for us 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:26.600
 the mirror let's see what a 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:31.050
 friend mistake in the whole talent see what 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.090
 happens with the entire palette 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.590
 Looks like it introduces a 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.539
 here below as if it were 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.520
 a mirror as if it were a mirror 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.220
 Let's see if we can just leave. 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.930
 take this previous effect that we will see 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.840
 if we can do configure it 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.919
 in a way that we visualize a 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.310
 greater utility for him 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:59.030
 Let's see if I put 10 and 10 here as 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.030
 if it were a mirror 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:24.960
 even though we're going down here because 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:37.259
 I put here I put here 50 50 50 and 51 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:39.389
 mirror the mirror is funny right then 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:40.800
 People just to show you why 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.810
 Sometimes we pick up to be able to 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.599
 find out how it puts the effect on me 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.830
 especially in this case 

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.880
 video edited wanting a place 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.590
 different. 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.300
 no use you click here not you 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.039
 clicked ac click here and still have to 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.719
 fall twice here to appear 

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.159
 third abba if this 

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:59.130
 third way you will not be able to 

00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:02.129
 edit the special effect spirit this 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.889
 that I wanted here today a test in the 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:06.629
 next to maybe I'll put some 

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:08.190
 more interesting effect something 

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:09.690
 that I was gradually discovering if 

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.400
 You want to put it there too. 

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.129
 comment then save invitation 

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.229
 indicate to me what is accepted because it is good 

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.789
 that we will share information 

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:20.300
 thank you so much for your attention until 

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.300
 next
