00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.849

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.780
 plate 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.980
 that's how our strawberries look 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.319
 damaged and stuffed with wireframe here 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.060
 You can also fill them with the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.189
 prince but nothing else you have to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.500
 leave it a little thicker because if 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.659
 not what is going to be is going to put liquid 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.730
 and then it's going to look a little bad because 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.730
 it's going to melt down the sides it's going 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.200

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.440

 which also offers us a little bit 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.970
 more crooked than the others so there 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.040
 have to try to accommodate them because there is 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.840
 this tutorial is very easy but the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.450
