00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.170
 transferred to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:42.850
 we have a lot of documents that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.160
 and with the help of every kind 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.300
 current radio and other analyzes 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.300
 shows them up 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.670
 full time creating stuff on on this 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.710
 background claim such things all this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.400
 it was written where by the 17th century and later 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.260
 it's just that you just have to think and to 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 Fortunately, he correctly guessed 6 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.739
 enough idiots who 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.380
 can believe it 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.810
 and people who at least know something 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.460
 I can't believe it, that is, until 1 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.850
 seriously discuss this should not 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.470
 theory let's say the world conspiracy 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:21.250
 falsification number well what is it this 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.410
 very interesting, probably, but I think that 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.200
 if you take fiction so 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.410
 called that at the level of all their don 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.900
 Marian them there and other things such a scientific 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.820
 literature 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.380
 Now, after all, the issue of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.960
 whether tom should study history as its 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.660
 protect the extent here I am the other day 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.350
 wrote in a literary newspaper 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.590
 startling statement of one 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 famous politician 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.910
 modern 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.000
 Now historians are trying to present 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.170
 that in 1500 some year it's just 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.140
 the era of Ivan the Terrible who will 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.869
 trying to teach that in 1500 some 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.570
 was something they had to, there was nothing 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.600
 all this intrigues well as you can guess 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.880
 for feline us these are what nobody 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.750
 will say but the trouble is something else 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.950
 a humorous text would say 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.860
 smiley matching 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.350
 relationship unfortunately not so far from 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.880
 of what happens at all with 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.030
 historical science from historical 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 of education 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.340
 university and school history programs 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.850
 shrinking a lot like me 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.410
 university professor 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.720
 in particular we have to meet 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.519
 students who come from school they 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.220
 don't know it at all very sad 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.829
 because we don't know us on 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.860
 every second word of kvan political 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.380
 figure is patriotism now good words 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.600
 but how can you be a patriot without knowing 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.060
 a patriot what if you don't know the story 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.120
 own homeland and unfortunately from 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.530
 provisions such well, if not at the level 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.970
 comic chernomyrdin understand but 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.890
 all the same she is very anxious 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.130
 I, in particular, am doing this 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.040
 the problem of promoting historical knowledge 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.810
 struggle with their distortions for so many years 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.050
 Here I have such a book here she 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.660
 lies the history of russia 1 to st. petersburg 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.000
 last chapter iii ends last 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 Part A ends with a chapter learning 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.920
 learn not to put it must be very 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.860
 seriously study because unfortunately 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.630
 falsification of history is very old 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.510
 Well, since we can not review all 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.970
 history of falsification of the distortion of history 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:02.220
 then let's do two words about what happened 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:06.060
 Ivan the terrible Ivan Vasilich the terrible 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.720
 which is devoted here is my book which 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.380
 before you lies he was in many 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.150
 relationship man exclusively 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.799
 interesting and we still have time 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.540
 let's talk but he was big at the same time 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.600
 master 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.600
 remaking the story he personally 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.470
 and under his leadership but personally 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.930
 repeat with my own hand 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.390
 participated in peace perry scripture in 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.310
 remake of Russian history with him was 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.350
 written so-called power book 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.770
 where is the whole Russian history from the ancient 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.360
 Since times was written not such what she 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.700
 that is, there was no 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.470
 specific fragmentation has always been 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.570
 autocracy and always 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.980
 united statesmen you 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.110
 were his direct ancestors 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:01.120
 which of course is wrong he rewrote under his 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.390
 leadership what to say but with his direct 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.830
 participation of the whole world history 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.850
 a huge batch was purchased 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.590
 wonderful paper from france and 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.410
 brought the paper on which they wrote 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.730
 the french kings on this paper were 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.730
 written 10 volumes of world history 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:25.510
 and each text was accompanied by 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.990
 miniatures gorgeous picture here 10 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.050

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.300
 10 ton resistor was dedicated to start it 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.860
 the kingdom and here it is he did not leave without 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.200
 attention with your own hand 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.300
 crossing out what is written there did 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.750
 Note to the pictures wrote whole new 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.060

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.280
 comma as they say but during this time 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.460
 while rewrote this thousand pages 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.280
