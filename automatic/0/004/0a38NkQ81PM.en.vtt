00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.940
 the microblogging applications like 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.010
 can be in this case twitter which is what 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.720
 that we are going to study reinforce what 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.090
 would services like mail 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.920
 electronic instant messaging 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.680
 other social networks online courses 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.780
 etcetera among some of the advantages 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 It should be noted that they develop 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.789
 student's ability to synthesize and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.580
 forcing or forcing him to detect what 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.879
 important and thus eliminating what is 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.769
 more superfluous is not invasive or is not so 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.239
 invasive to privacy like other 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.309
 networks since the twitter profiles 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.930
 they have very little information 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.450
 user since it has a little space 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.700
 to put your personal data except 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.490
 that they include them already later in their tweets 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.950
 and then it also allows us 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.250
 see a twitter account without having to 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.940
 have none created and then also 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.920
 favors what would be the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.770
 communication between the communications 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.900
 student and the teacher from among 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.240
 different uses that we can give him then 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.950
 It should be noted as a daily class in 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.290
 which could be summarized what is 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.150
 done every day there is a practice that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.700
 consists of asking one or two students 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.030
 that each day summarize the basic points 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.410
 of the class allowing the rest to see 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.050
 those points refute sharing them or 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.550
 just so good to know them later 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.740
 also favors direct contact 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.200
 among students and between students and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.570
 teachers and then you can also 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.910
 you can use then to inform mode 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.190
 of bulletin board indicating therefore by 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.040
 example a classroom change 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.130
 a professor's delay the subject that 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.650
 is going to give the next day or reminders 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.830
 of type exams dates exams or 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.530
 task delivery dates also what 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.740
 we could use to announce events 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.540
 how can they be congresses or seminars 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.760
 associating them for example a link to 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.520
 they 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.530
 then they can also be worth to 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.050
 create debates among students can be 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.420
 encourage from questions as a 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.979
 series of debates among them also with 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.110
 the advantage that there is associated with a 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.070
 specific hashtag will facilitate the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.510
 collection of classification of those 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.120
 tweets being able at any time 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.150
 recover them 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 the teacher also through the account 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.560
 of the subject could for example 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.200
 if you create a specific account you can 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.870
 see all the interactions that have 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.569
 had these students then also they 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.829
 can use as a forum for doubts 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.010
 using a specific hashtag to 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.010
 this then especially so for doubts 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.760
 concrete or individual as 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.170
 interesting as it would be the mention 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.450
 leaving the published information 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.950
 as a forum that subsequently 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 may be consulted by others 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.060
 mates clicking on that hashtag then 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.379
 for more personal questions as 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 could be used for example 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.480
 direct messages for it would be 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.819
 necessary in this case that the teacher or 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.200
 the associated account of the subject 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.120
 I also followed the students 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.980
 both followed then we can also 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.290
 join additional materials like links 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.940
 Articles or videos allowing you to learn 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.760
 more to the students on some topic 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.040
 specific and then we will also get 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.290
 encourage student participation 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.900
 thus promoting for example that they look for 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.150
 and contribute materials for the course 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.760
 or additional information 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.769
 then also favors the extension of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 classroom beyond what is the classroom 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.170
 physical receiving even contributions 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.019
 both external professionals and 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.540
 other teachers or alumni we 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.730
 will also support students 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.349
 external self-taught today we can 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.780
 follow other teachers or 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.120
 professionals on twitter well to be 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.220
 up to date on the latest in teaching and 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.590
 catch new ideas for example or about 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.620
 the last of a specific subject of the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.290
 subject will be able to track hashtags and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.780
 current events by selecting fis or 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.540
 specific foods so that 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.730
 class can follow them you can create a 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 face for a class eg mode 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.400
 of hashtag with which to publish the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.049
 task alerts events or new classes 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.870
 They can also connect with other 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.359
 classes of other teachers or parents for 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.090
 increase communication and build 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.009
 a community in such a way that it 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.630
 bring students to the 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.729
 professionals to the different 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.490
 professionals and create well 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:37.550
 for a more open community beyond 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.550
 of what the classroom itself would be 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.020
 ah
