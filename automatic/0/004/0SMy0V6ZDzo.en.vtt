00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
it was really pretty quick I was able to

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.350 
it was really pretty quick I was able to
be<00:00:52.780> productive<00:00:53.309> immediately<00:00:54.309> when<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.030> first

be productive immediately when I first

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.060 
be productive immediately when I first
started<00:00:55.809> finishing<00:00:56.230> with<00:00:56.649> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
started finishing with it

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.090 
started finishing with it
I<00:00:57.100> loved<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.270> visibility<00:00:58.930> how<00:00:59.379> you<00:00:59.440> could<00:00:59.829> see

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
I loved the visibility how you could see

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.880 
I loved the visibility how you could see
you<00:01:00.610> can<00:01:00.790> see<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.239> much<00:01:01.390> more<00:01:01.710> sometimes<00:01:02.710> you

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
you can see so much more sometimes you

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.499 
you can see so much more sometimes you
get<00:01:02.980> in<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.160> situation<00:01:03.399> to<00:01:03.850> where<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.239> can't

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
get in a situation to where you can't

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.540 
get in a situation to where you can't
always<00:01:04.720> run<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.050> hub<00:01:05.350> off<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.800> your<00:01:05.950> toe<00:01:06.160> end<00:01:06.369> you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
always run a hub off of your toe end you

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.609 
always run a hub off of your toe end you
have<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:06.729> run<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> hub<00:01:07.180> off<00:01:07.330> your<00:01:07.509> heel<00:01:07.720> end<00:01:07.990> but

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
have to run a hub off your heel end but

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.950 
have to run a hub off your heel end but
then<00:01:08.800> you're<00:01:08.979> in<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.250> position<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:10.600> where<00:01:10.750> you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
then you're in a position to where you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.410 
then you're in a position to where you
can't<00:01:11.259> have<00:01:11.710> your<00:01:11.890> board<00:01:12.160> you<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.300> have

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
can't have your board you have to have

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.999 
can't have your board you have to have
your<00:01:13.509> board<00:01:13.750> right<00:01:13.899> off<00:01:14.020> your<00:01:14.170> rear<00:01:14.410> tire<00:01:14.649> and

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
your board right off your rear tire and

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.279 
your board right off your rear tire and
an<00:01:15.640> older-style<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.450> came<00:01:16.660> out<00:01:16.869> and

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
an older-style that came out and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.290 
an older-style that came out and
sometimes<00:01:18.070> you'd<00:01:18.190> have<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.430> lean<00:01:18.610> forward<00:01:19.119> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
sometimes you'd have to lean forward and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.510 
sometimes you'd have to lean forward and
look<00:01:20.170> at<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.740> see<00:01:20.890> if<00:01:20.920> you're<00:01:21.160> running<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
look at it and see if you're running the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.340 
look at it and see if you're running the
hub<00:01:21.700> right<00:01:21.940> this<00:01:22.270> one<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:22.600> just<00:01:22.780> kind<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:23.080> you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
hub right this one you just kind of you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.010 
hub right this one you just kind of you
can<00:01:23.500> put<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.010> right<00:01:24.040> there<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:25.869> see

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
can put it right there and you can see

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.420 
can put it right there and you can see
the<00:01:26.140> material<00:01:26.260> being<00:01:26.680> delivered<00:01:27.010> and<00:01:27.310> how

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
the material being delivered and how

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.670 
the material being delivered and how
much<00:01:27.580> you're<00:01:27.729> cutting<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:29.380> the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
much you're cutting and it's the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.169 
much you're cutting and it's the
visibility<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.400> very<00:01:30.460> very<00:01:30.970> nice

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.649 

the<00:01:36.630> 140<00:01:37.409> m2<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:38.189> quite<00:01:38.969> a<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> power<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the 140 m2 has quite a bit of power I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
the 140 m2 has quite a bit of power I
mean<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.289> got<00:01:40.439> V<00:01:40.590> HP<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:42.210> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
mean it's got V HP I like the how you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.319 
mean it's got V HP I like the how you
can<00:01:42.479> adjust<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:43.130> hydraulic<00:01:44.130> functions<00:01:44.329> from

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
can adjust your hydraulic functions from

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.389 
can adjust your hydraulic functions from
fine<00:01:45.659> coarse<00:01:46.049> medium<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.039> say<00:01:47.310> you're

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
fine coarse medium you know say you're

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.800 
fine coarse medium you know say you're
chasing<00:01:47.759> scrapers<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> want<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.539> course

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
chasing scrapers you want it on course

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.240 
chasing scrapers you want it on course
you<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.109> it<00:01:49.170> real<00:01:49.289> fast<00:01:49.469> cuz<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.069> go<00:01:50.189> up

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you want it real fast cuz you can go up

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
you want it real fast cuz you can go up
and<00:01:50.399> finishing<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> want<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.719> slow

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and finishing you kind of want it slow

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.959 
and finishing you kind of want it slow
real<00:01:52.350> slow<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.890> bump<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.219> here<00:01:53.399> bump<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> there

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
real slow so bump it here bump it there

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.999 
real slow so bump it here bump it there
I've<00:01:54.659> noticed<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.679> difference

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I've noticed a little bit of difference

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.399 
I've noticed a little bit of difference
the<00:01:56.520> H<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.539> know<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.990> you're

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the H is you know when you're you're

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
the H is you know when you're you're
finishing<00:01:58.829> something<00:01:59.670> real<00:02:00.149> critical

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
finishing something real critical

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.419 
finishing something real critical
airport<00:02:01.109> runway<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.890> something<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
airport runway or something like that

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.010 
airport runway or something like that
where<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.179> tight<00:02:03.420> tolerances

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
where you have really tight tolerances

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
where you have really tight tolerances
the<00:02:04.799> hydraulics<00:02:05.310> are<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.700> less

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the hydraulics are a little less

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.839 
the hydraulics are a little less
responsive<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> MS<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.459> tend

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
responsive than the MS and and you tend

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.410 
responsive than the MS and and you tend
