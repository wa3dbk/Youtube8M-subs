00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 Ha ha ha 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.350
 No N 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 I wonder if I lost my way 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.280
 Things that appear occasionally 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.280
 Such a deep fog gar 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.380
 Somewhere before 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.860
 That's it 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.350
 I used to be a bird that resembles you a long time ago 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.390
 Or it was a stormy day 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.049
 I will not get lost 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.049
 It had enriched the signpost from the task was 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.179
 However 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.500
 Mouse wjan 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 I will not be in sari 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.380
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.510
 I was surrounded by the mist before I knew it 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.760
 Bounty to teach the way 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.700
 I myself 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.700
 I even lost my place 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.410
 I saw it in the fog 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.410
 Despair was only Tsu 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.720
 But 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:03.890
 At that time 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 I met a migratory bird like you are now 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.420
 He seeks paradise 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.420
 It has been done far from the east 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.750
 I wondered 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.970
 I wonder if I get lost 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.970
 Aren't you scared of the unknown world ? 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.850
 The migratory bird taught me 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.850
 Hmm 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.340
 Yeah flow of the tide 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.319
 Of fish 60 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.450
 I do not like 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.110
 Change to the sky Tires and the moon 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:03.870
 Everything in this world is good 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.870
 You tell me where I am 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.099
 I closed my eyes 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.180
 Leave the flow 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.109
 Swimming water pressure of fish 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.550
 Cries of the wind 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.560
 The fog goes out 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.560
 I felt a moment of silence 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.020
 And i understood 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.890
 Where are you 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.259
 If it is my whereabouts 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.529
 Hmm 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:56.380
 The migratory bird taught me that 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.380
 We traveled towards the far distant paradise Morne 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.030
 How is it 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.000
 Can I still fly 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.500

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.460

 Strong 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.639
 Father goes out 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.560
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.510
