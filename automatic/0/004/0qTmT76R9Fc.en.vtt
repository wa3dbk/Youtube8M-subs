put<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.130> many<00:02:26.370> parts<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.120> many<00:02:27.360> sections<00:02:27.840> as

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
put as many parts as many sections as

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.360 
put as many parts as many sections as
possible<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.900> sky's<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.290> limit<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.190> that's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
possible the sky's the limit so that's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.660 
possible the sky's the limit so that's
what<00:02:32.610> they<00:02:32.730> both<00:02:32.940> look<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.810> side<00:02:34.049> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
what they both look like this side and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.690 
what they both look like this side and
actually<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.450> am<00:02:37.110> pretty<00:02:37.590> much<00:02:37.680> almost<00:02:38.310> done

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
actually I am pretty much almost done

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.690 
actually I am pretty much almost done
I'm<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.570> fluffing<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I'm just going to be fluffing and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
I'm just going to be fluffing and
separating<00:02:41.700> those<00:02:42.510> twists<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:43.739> twist<00:02:44.070> out

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
separating those twists a my twist out

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.050 
separating those twists a my twist out
there<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.709> watch<00:02:47.100> me<00:02:47.400> notch<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.970> really

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
there and you watch me notch and really

00:02:48.060 --> 00:03:19.080 
there and you watch me notch and really
ladies<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.590> easy

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.930 

so<00:03:20.090> as<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.390> can<00:03:20.540> see<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.959> bluffin<00:03:21.830> is<00:03:22.430> still

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
so as you can see the bluffin is still

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.240 
so as you can see the bluffin is still

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
continuing this pretty much the Scala
