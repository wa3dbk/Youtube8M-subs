00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.810 

I<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:35.630> think<00:01:35.870> I<00:01:35.960> never<00:01:36.260> experienced<00:01:37.130> Thai

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820

food that elegant you know with you know
it<00:01:42.260> was<00:01:42.380> reminiscent<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:43.010> being<00:01:43.340> in<00:01:43.460> Thailand

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
it was reminiscent of being in Thailand

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.970 
it was reminiscent of being in Thailand
but<00:01:43.940> also<00:01:44.120> a<00:01:44.570> flair<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.410> that<00:01:45.710> I've<00:01:45.830> never

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980

pissed<00:04:14.470> off<00:04:14.650> what<00:04:14.950> happened<00:04:15.100> last<00:04:15.400> night<00:04:15.580> but

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
pissed off what happened last night but

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.979 
pissed off what happened last night but
I<00:04:15.910> think<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> Americans<00:04:16.540> did<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.720> great<00:04:16.959> job

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
I think the Americans did a great job

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.650 
I think the Americans did a great job
and<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.799> think<00:04:17.980> soccer<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.459> not<00:04:19.120> only<00:04:19.299> becoming

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
and I think soccer is not only becoming

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.420 
and I think soccer is not only becoming
great<00:04:19.930> but<00:04:20.080> it<00:04:20.170> just<00:04:20.320> shows<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.590> Americans

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
great but it just shows that Americans

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.160 
great but it just shows that Americans
can<00:04:21.459> do<00:04:21.640> really<00:04:22.060> good<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> World<00:04:22.780> Cup<00:04:22.960> I

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
can do really good at the World Cup I

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.480 
can do really good at the World Cup I
think<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.470> we<00:04:23.770> should<00:04:23.800> be<00:04:24.010> really<00:04:24.250> proud<00:04:24.280> of

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
think that we should be really proud of

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.550 
think that we should be really proud of
what<00:04:25.150> they<00:04:25.270> did<00:04:25.450> what's<00:04:25.840> your<00:04:25.960> prediction<00:04:26.110> now

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560

for<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.860> finals<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.490> think<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:28.420> gonna<00:04:28.570> come

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
down to Brazil Germany I think the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.450 
down to Brazil Germany I think the
