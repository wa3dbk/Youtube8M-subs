00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.770
 yes the domain in general so you have 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.250
 for example a reserve in this 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.930

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.010
 once you have served this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.500

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.310
 fur 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.440
 either we kill a wolf and we have 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.440
 fur or buy it to the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.890
 hunter is like wood on the other hand 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:59.920

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.350
 in our network once that is 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.570
 do we press on greek and india our 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.920
 same belt for all materials 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:15.520
 kind if I go not lighter 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.400
 disinfectant I need the doctor to 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.110
 pop the worst sees there I have 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.180
 disinfectant to operate the 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.860
 trade but I already sent a convoy 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.940
 where I delivered wood and weeping I 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.120
 a second land convoy 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.300
 the convoys we find them for example from 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.460
 special items recipes there I have a 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.330
 convoy land of agen naval convoy 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.840
 the aja earthly king in the world 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.850
 e trade for example I have two 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.990
 land convoys 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.080
 I add an object wants to send by 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.130
 example of the water I want to sell to that 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.770
 who will give me the most read 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.170
 but but but that increases the 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.150
 risks for example with this mast with a 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.880
 shell shocks number 5 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:11.450
 he gives me nine free for this 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:16.770
 bottle of water but I have 10% risk 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:19.350
 for schild and gold he gives me twelve 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.940
 pounds but there is 35% risk the 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:28.260
 thing gets attacked selling it because 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.670
 than 10% and I send the convoy in twelve 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.590
 minutes normally if everything happens 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.020
 alright I get from sir agent 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.970
 gets 80 after that it's not huge 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:44.310
 the media but not when we sell 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:51.680
 objects that are very rare for them 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.680
 here I think to find helene 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.850
 Helen went dancing in New York 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.310
 to find it must already do the 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:04.500
 precarious quests quests 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.819
 before what of the domain 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:12.870
 previous before you can unlock 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:15.120

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.970
 if you look good but down 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:28.500
 arrow 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.039
 normally we can have more for 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.000
 increase to see the pattern or the recipe 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:39.120
 how do you want karkwa that you 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.570
 increase your arrow by 8 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.470
 card you manufacture by device on the 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.080
 account book the same for the for the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:53.280
 cartridge for two cartridges 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:57.090

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.780
 for stuffed animals is poisoned for 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.130
 the baits to stick them by a little 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.840
