 Which company is this year?

 We are sitting in% when pair running cases are still missing 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.800

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.550
 the air cools down there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330
 like the one in Spa 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.589
 that's actually the case and a loft falls actually to the groups 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.559
 Nissan solvent good tenants give better chances at the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.870
 Apartment to arrive

 Hembach found good tenants so what defines him as a good tenant 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 so good rent 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720
 There is a couple of absolute sizes, no stone unturned 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.950
 Assessment 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.080
 so of course it absolutely is someone who is reliable for me that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.630
 Apartment devastates his rent punctually paid as he gives it so 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 so to speak, they kick their deep what others use from this mass

 expulsion 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.650
 to be on Moss but so there are very very subjective needs 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.540
 on the part of the landlord what was once an ideal tenant 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.270
 for example, they are looking for this child-friendly because they are 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.190
 especially Otte with mentioned purposes where kids do not really care 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.210
 appropriate if so rather stop without a finale not the tester

 The fathers you then out to think that is actually good tenants 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.050
 at the moment it is so we are the weir a sky without a platform 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.030
 means food with us

 good% number of tenants Angela were invited 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.550
 and whoever invokes the principle that good people invite good people 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.200
 very strong 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.860
 Percent Restricted so you can only invite three people currently 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.780
 and that is a great way to start and percent the Wien Tel high quality too 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.250
 hold at the same time 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.430
 percent of companies we know are good 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.490
 Employees can and do the service for their employees, so to speak 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.709
 provide 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.779
 110 on Social minimize this to also spread invitations 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.009
 In the end, Hamm will not get it, but every Hans and Franz Moor game I play 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.179
 I got one 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.259
 with gifts you can wish candidates 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.649
 Well, it's very clear that such mechanisms only last for a while 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.239
 very good 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.219
 And important to us too is that we are more and more on the increase 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.169
 Platform after 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.189
 separating the wheat from the chaff Bochum talked about it is a sport 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.909
 Wheat of it is important that afterwards a provider of a flat very quickly 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.069
 they firmly find a gallows the candidate and that means there information percent 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.879
 early to send the provider 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.659
 He can then base his decision on his decision 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.150
 If he suits him he would not have multiple employees but he 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.740
 he does 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.880
 So frankly we are not up in the thumbs up or down here 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.560
 salamander 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.880
 Places law at the end shows it will be the landlord again this one 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.209
 today so that you can see absolutely everything about the apartment in advance 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.809
 "But on the one hand, it's a complete black hole 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.760
 and we actually want to create a situation in which both sides are in like 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.049
 find better due to 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.159
 Information about whether they can match 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.119
 you can rate that yourself best 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.489
 Hamm their coach Becker driver is still free for the people who 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.300
 only looking for an apartment but that should become a judge later 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.240
 the same 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.599
 What we do in essence is that we want to provide a jump for those interested 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.329
 more quickly 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.869

 PrÃ¶ll that the Fed was the FMA's monetary performance in this competitive city 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.899
 markets 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.569
 I think everyone should want this and there is a real one 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.809
 Today, the turnaround systematically today by serving and in the stomach 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.719
 For the money really we see a light model as they use economic model 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.829
 in order for the time when we in principle offer this service we 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.109
 The chances of being on packaged to be bettered money will be Heinz 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.519
 big banks 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.699
 now there is a low end in Vienna Hamburg and the pictures are also in 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.099
 Frankfurt and Munich become active 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.109
 There is, of course, an absolute shortage of housing and hear that of the 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.279
 Singing a platform he may be more interesting to all people the one 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.689
 Why should I search for a flat over the apartment though? 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:13.609
 I hire 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:14.499
 that is a 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.239
 Question you have asked yourself 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.489
 The fact is, though 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.400
 even in these markets today the providers are not satisfied with the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.660
 Situation if you have a problem with the new three bedroom apartments in today 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.080
 a nice town Hallein then gets you hear from a few minutes 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.340
 really hundreds of requests 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.340
 and you have no information Lotte that means you make masses 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.530
 Sightseeing with cakes of which I say who knows who 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.550
 if they would fit on the apartment with harder ones 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.039
 we will save the providers in the amount of time in it from scratch 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.509
 the DEG with the right people to meet and instead of 300% anonymous 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.340
 Requests 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.699
 Six people find each other to look for and talk to 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.870
 but this is good news today, for example, because the Chancellor's office is doing some good 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.710
 Residential areas obviously run rough 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.809
 Lewentz awarded under the hand 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:01.929
 Also shown as a system Barts pro with the 10 out and sang on 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:03.779
 Facebook not looking for meters 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.979
 therefore come and she will still have some pictures to look at and so on 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.539
 further so we just want those processes to be 2 to 10 yapi fictitious 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.580
 It is not exactly the percent of crack all around 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.000
 since 1 providers snatched active apartment he has no problem her husband too 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.509
 Find 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.279
 as I said as to actually already with 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.489
 Thousands percent have talked to over a thousand sellers 

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:30.530
 Realtor administrator owner 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.290
 and over 80 percent have signaled that they are percent interested 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.480
 join in so then the interest is great 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.289
 because they spend an insane time with it today 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.169
 choose with Benita 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.720
 because they get so many requests 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.400
 and we will be service 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.839
 roughly speaking 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:49.399
 and ponds that only 50% big carp lead where you can find it 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:51.050
 Fishing can 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.050
 I have 4 m on your homepage winner 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.860
 IAA also actively integrates social media channels and you promise 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.119
 yes the people who advertise an apartment Burch that reach 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:08.490
 but it is not counterproductive to be productive 

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:12.929
 Armani social media channels uses a more rigorous approach 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.020
 that is something different again that's the idea that 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.650
 if I just ask today on Facebook 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.389
 If you are in a three-bedroom apartment then many unqualified 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.569
 questions 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.069
 If I am tempted, I can create with Cortes Expose 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.119
 and can be on Facebook and via e-mail or mobile phone at my fingertips 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.990

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.900
 to distribute 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.520
 and maybe without it being published somewhere else 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.289
 but then it will be distributed from Silesia my network that is something 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.310
 Today everywhere apartment thing Latin wise in the network market happens we care 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.680
 just to make it easier, so there you can 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.960
 everyone because my network is actually can see the whole expose 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.190
 do not ask questions 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.699
 you can contact me directly 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.080
 that's just for the people 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.060
 Werner search this way over the network and at the same time conspiracy for 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.639

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:06.860
 free for those in series 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.309
 until further notice percentages are free on the supplier side 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:14.129
 because we actually have exactly the sellers the great apartment have no hurdles in 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:15.080
 the way 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.610
