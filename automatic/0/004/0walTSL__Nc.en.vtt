stepped into a second cubby and this is

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.670 
stepped into a second cubby and this is
where<00:03:02.209> things<00:03:02.420> got<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:02.959> interesting<00:03:03.080> and

down in this special robotic chair this

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.810 
down in this special robotic chair this
is<00:03:36.170> something<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.980> interesting<00:03:37.700> because

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
supported your entire leg moved

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.580 
supported your entire leg moved
everything<00:04:16.760> into<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.329> right<00:04:17.510> position<00:04:18.109> which

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
everything into the right position which

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.170 
everything into the right position which
is<00:04:18.739> really<00:04:19.039> really<00:04:19.130> interesting<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:19.970> my

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
is really really interesting in my

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.600 
is really really interesting in my

then<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:33.310> chair<00:04:33.610> did<00:04:33.910> its<00:04:34.060> robotic<00:04:34.449> moves

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
then the chair did its robotic moves

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.589 
then the chair did its robotic moves
again<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:35.500> sat<00:04:35.860> me<00:04:36.069> back<00:04:36.250> up<00:04:36.460> at<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:37.060> point<00:04:37.389> I

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599
