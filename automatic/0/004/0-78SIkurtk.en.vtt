together<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.189> two<00:00:20.400> parts<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.939> although

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
together it's two parts here although

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
together it's two parts here although
you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:22.050> where<00:00:22.320> you're<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
you can see where you're going to do the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.990 
you can see where you're going to do the
connections<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.519> you're<00:00:23.609> transforming

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
connections when you're transforming

this<00:00:24.240> into<00:00:24.300> its<00:00:24.660> larger<00:00:25.109> Buster<00:00:25.890> variants<00:00:26.460> but

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this into its larger Buster variants but

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.130 
this into its larger Buster variants but
it's<00:00:27.210> sort<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.420> cool<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.539> don't<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> pop

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it's sort of cool you don't have to pop

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.419 
it's sort of cool you don't have to pop
it<00:00:28.170> out<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> turn<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:28.949> anything<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.279> that

it out and turn it or anything like that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.609 
it out and turn it or anything like that
you're<00:00:29.730> able<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.119> turn<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:31.140> only<00:00:31.260> 90

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.990 
you're able to turn it but only 90
degrees<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> that's<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> turn<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> from

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
degrees and that's if you turn it from

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
degrees and that's if you turn it from
the<00:00:33.149> sword<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.660> rifle<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.010> in

the sword to the rifle when it's in

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.819 
the sword to the rifle when it's in
sword<00:00:35.399> mode<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> handle<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.840> not

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
sword mode like this the handle is not

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.139 
sword mode like this the handle is not
going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> move<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.370> way<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> will<00:00:38.940> Bend

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
going to move this way but it will Bend

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.180 
going to move this way but it will Bend
down<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.469> part<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
down that way and this part is going to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
down that way and this part is going to
plug<00:00:41.460> into<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.210> forearm<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
plug into the forearm and because of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
plug into the forearm and because of
that<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.280> has<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.550> pivoting<00:00:45.059> gray<00:00:45.629> part<00:00:45.930> here

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that it has this pivoting gray part here

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.720 
that it has this pivoting gray part here
which<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> plug<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.610> hopefully

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
which is going to plug in and hopefully

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
which is going to plug in and hopefully
lock<00:00:48.059> everything<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.660> position<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> allow

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lock everything into position and allow

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040 
lock everything into position and allow
the<00:00:49.469> hand<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.430> moved<00:00:50.640> around<00:00:50.840> because<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the hand to be moved around because this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.479 
the hand to be moved around because this
is<00:00:52.199> also<00:00:52.350> rotating<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.070> seems<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
is also rotating which seems like a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.819 
is also rotating which seems like a
pretty<00:00:53.579> good<00:00:53.789> touch<00:00:54.120> you're<00:00:55.110> able<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> swing

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
pretty good touch you're able to swing

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.959 
pretty good touch you're able to swing
this<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.250> you'll<00:00:56.370> notice<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this up and you'll notice that it's on a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.000 
this up and you'll notice that it's on a
slider<00:00:57.360> mechanism<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
slider mechanism there and if you do

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
slider mechanism there and if you do
want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> put<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> rifle<00:00:59.910> mode<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
want to put it into the rifle mode you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
want to put it into the rifle mode you
bend<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.199> down<00:01:01.590> bend<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> handle<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.820> turn

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
bend that down bend the handle down turn

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
bend that down bend the handle down turn
that<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.690> all<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> sudden<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that and all of a sudden you have a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.120 
that and all of a sudden you have a
blaster<00:01:05.900> starting<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> shield<00:01:07.409> connector

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
blaster starting with a shield connector

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
blaster starting with a shield connector
this<00:01:08.369> thing<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.760> absolutely<00:01:09.030> solid<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this thing is absolutely solid as a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
this thing is absolutely solid as a
rocker<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> feels<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> beginning

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
rocker so it feels at the beginning

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
rocker so it feels at the beginning
solid<00:01:12.390> piece<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.380> move

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
solid piece up here it's going to move

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.249 
solid piece up here it's going to move
this<00:01:13.979> much<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.479> part<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.110> also

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
this much here this part here is also

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
this much here this part here is also
going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.650> bend<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.880> then

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
going to bend up and down and then

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
going to bend up and down and then
you're<00:01:18.450> able<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> move<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> around<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:20.130> all

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
you're able to move it around here all

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.170 
you're able to move it around here all
the<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:21.720> bends<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.000> here<00:01:24.000> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the way it also bends here and here so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.340 
the way it also bends here and here so
basically<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:25.049> able<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> get

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
basically you're going to be able to get

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
basically you're going to be able to get
this<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.680> any<00:01:25.860> position<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
this into any position you want but it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.160 
this into any position you want but it
doesn't<00:01:26.970> feel<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> fall<00:01:28.110> out

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
doesn't feel like it's going to fall out

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.130 
doesn't feel like it's going to fall out
of<00:01:28.380> place<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.579> rotates<00:01:30.420> ever<00:01:30.869> so

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
of place it also rotates ever so

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.580 
of place it also rotates ever so
slightly<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.610> blue<00:01:32.880> part<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.500> put<00:01:34.500> on

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
slightly here on this blue part I put on

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
slightly here on this blue part I put on
a<00:01:34.619> white<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.040> dry<00:01:35.310> deco<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
a white to dry deco here which is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.550 
a white to dry deco here which is
something<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.780> too<00:01:36.960> often<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
something I don't do too often but the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.190 
something I don't do too often but the
shield<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.060> beast<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.600> looks<00:01:39.780> really

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
shield is just a beast it looks really

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
shield is just a beast it looks really
really<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> where<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.729> happy

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
really good and where I'm really happy

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.950 
really good and where I'm really happy
with<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:42.659> putting<00:01:42.869> these

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
with it is when you're putting these

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.710 
with it is when you're putting these
blue<00:01:43.290> parts<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.799> top<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.390> grape

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
blue parts on top of here a lot of grape

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.330 
blue parts on top of here a lot of grape
there's<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> slits<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> gray

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
there's a lot of slits here so the gray

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
there's a lot of slits here so the gray
part<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.850> underneath<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.479> coming<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> come

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
part from underneath is coming to come

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.749 
part from underneath is coming to come
through<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:50.040> course<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> white

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
through and of course this is a white

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.520 
through and of course this is a white
part<00:01:51.149> instead<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.600> seal<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> high

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
part instead of a seal like on the high

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
part instead of a seal like on the high
grade<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> open<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.390> nicely

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
grade this is going to open up nicely

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
grade this is going to open up nicely
you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.049> room<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> put<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you have room to put a little bit of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.530 
you have room to put a little bit of
lining<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> front<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.759> back<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
lining on the front and back of that and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.260 
lining on the front and back of that and
of<00:01:58.079> course<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> pop<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.100> open<00:01:59.369> from<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
of course if you pop this open from the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.050 
of course if you pop this open from the
back<00:02:00.450> you're<00:02:01.170> able<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.680> swing<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.790> other

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
back you're able to swing out the other

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 
back you're able to swing out the other
drive<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.020> has<00:02:04.290> two<00:02:04.530> lenses<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
drive there and this has two lenses that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.889 
drive there and this has two lenses that
again<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.579> tells<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> put<00:02:06.060> seals<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
again it tells you to put seals on the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
again it tells you to put seals on the
insides<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
insides of but I'm not going to do that

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.040 
insides of but I'm not going to do that
so<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.209> hoping<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> light<00:02:09.840> comes

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so I'm hoping that the light comes

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
so I'm hoping that the light comes
through<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.590> little<00:02:11.250> bit

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
through a little bit

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.080 
through a little bit
near<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.349> bits<00:02:13.560> fit<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.280> fairly<00:02:14.519> solidly

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
near the bits fit on here fairly solidly

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.339 
near the bits fit on here fairly solidly
although<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> may<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.750> little<00:02:16.019> bit<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
although it may be a little bit of a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.110 
although it may be a little bit of a
challenge<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.709> get<00:02:16.890> them<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.760> part<00:02:18.030> is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
challenge to get them in this part is

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850 
challenge to get them in this part is
attached<00:02:18.420> into<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.530> this

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
attached into this one and then this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.369 
attached into this one and then this
part<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.300> notice<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> bent<00:02:22.110> up

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
part here you can notice that it bent up

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.080 
part here you can notice that it bent up
a<00:02:22.590> little<00:02:22.769> bit<00:02:22.980> before<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.310> moved<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.849> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
a little bit before I moved it out and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.880 
a little bit before I moved it out and
you'll<00:02:24.540> see<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.870> there's<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.260> part<00:02:25.590> here

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you'll see that there's this part here

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.680 
you'll see that there's this part here
and<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> bending<00:02:27.480> L

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and this is actually on a bending L

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.690 
and this is actually on a bending L
mechanism<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.160> Tetris<00:02:29.489> block

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
mechanism if you think of a Tetris block

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.460 
mechanism if you think of a Tetris block
with<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.090> three<00:02:30.269> parts<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:31.379> not

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
with just three parts I know that's not

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.380 
with just three parts I know that's not
a<00:02:31.530> Tetris<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.489> anyway<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.090> attach<00:02:33.360> that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
a Tetris but anyway when you attach that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.630 
a Tetris but anyway when you attach that
on<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> everything

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
on here then you can see that everything

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.699 
on here then you can see that everything
can<00:02:35.790> move<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.510> out<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.629> place<00:02:36.989> now<00:02:37.500> that's

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
can move in and out of place now that's

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.619 
can move in and out of place now that's
pretty<00:02:37.860> good<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.310> easy<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.760> put<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.480> when

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
pretty good it's easy to put on but when

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.030 
pretty good it's easy to put on but when
you<00:02:39.660> try<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.989> bend<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.349> off<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.739> side

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you try to bend it off to the side

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.890 
you try to bend it off to the side
sometimes<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> pop<00:02:42.629> off<00:02:42.870> on

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
sometimes it's just going to pop off on

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.870 
sometimes it's just going to pop off on
you<00:02:43.319> other<00:02:43.799> times<00:02:44.160> I've<00:02:44.340> had<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.489> just<00:02:44.730> move

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
you other times I've had to just move

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640 
you other times I've had to just move
very<00:02:45.150> very<00:02:45.269> smoothly<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> little<00:02:46.440> bit<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
very very smoothly so a little bit of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.140 
very very smoothly so a little bit of
patience<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.459> needed<00:02:47.849> there

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
patience is going to be needed there

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.050 
patience is going to be needed there
however<00:02:49.019> these<00:02:49.230> back<00:02:49.620> parts<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:50.489> first<00:02:50.940> of

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
however these back parts here first of

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.640 
however these back parts here first of
all<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.299> white<00:02:51.510> part<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.840> able<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.170> bend<00:02:52.380> up

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
all this white part is able to bend up

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.050 
all this white part is able to bend up
and<00:02:52.799> down<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.160> if<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.340> bend<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.610> up<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.849> course

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and down but if you bend it up of course

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.550 
and down but if you bend it up of course
it's<00:02:54.239> going<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.420> hide<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:54.810> attachment<00:02:55.170> and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it's going to hide this attachment and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's going to hide this attachment and
when<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.489> there's<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.150> bend

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
when you do that there's a bend

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.539 
when you do that there's a bend
mechanism<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.079> here<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.620> bends<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.250> part

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
mechanism in here that bends this part

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.610 
mechanism in here that bends this part
out<00:02:59.730> very<00:03:00.360> very<00:03:00.660> solidly<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.349> you're<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
out very very solidly so you're going to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.050 
out very very solidly so you're going to
have<00:03:01.709> no<00:03:01.860> problem<00:03:02.280> swinging<00:03:02.730> out<00:03:02.819> these

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
have no problem swinging out these

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.119 
have no problem swinging out these
bottom<00:03:03.480> parts<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.379> make<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.680> shield<00:03:04.950> look

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
bottom parts to make this shield look

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.680 
bottom parts to make this shield look
even<00:03:05.400> more<00:03:05.579> menacing<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.180> already<00:03:06.299> is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
even more menacing that it already is

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.140 
even more menacing that it already is
and<00:03:06.989> though<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.010> doesn't<00:03:08.160> feel<00:03:08.310> instinctive

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and though it doesn't feel instinctive

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.089 
and though it doesn't feel instinctive
if<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.420> end<00:03:09.660> up<00:03:09.840> pushing<00:03:10.230> up<00:03:10.379> pretty<00:03:10.620> hard<00:03:10.950> on

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
if you end up pushing up pretty hard on

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.009 
if you end up pushing up pretty hard on
this<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.519> going<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.760> stay<00:03:12.030> connected<00:03:12.329> well

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
this it's going to stay connected well

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.809 
this it's going to stay connected well
you<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.379> up<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.459> course<00:03:14.670> now

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
you get it up there and of course now

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.460 
you get it up there and of course now
you<00:03:14.879> can<00:03:15.150> bend<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.629> and<00:03:15.810> down<00:03:15.900> here<00:03:16.350> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
you can bend it up and down here and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.680 
you can bend it up and down here and
you're<00:03:16.859> also<00:03:17.040> able<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.430> move<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:17.880> bit<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.480> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
you're also able to move this bit so you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.390 
you're also able to move this bit so you
have<00:03:18.750> all<00:03:19.230> sorts<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.680> different<00:03:19.889> positions

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
have all sorts of different positions

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.449 
have all sorts of different positions
but<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.239> general<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> its<00:03:22.319> menacing<00:03:22.530> form<00:03:23.010> it's

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
but in general in its menacing form it's

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.490 
but in general in its menacing form it's
going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.880> look<00:03:24.030> something<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.780> this

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.960 

the<00:03:28.500> double<00:03:28.829> set<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.069> bits<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.400> very<00:03:29.579> easy<00:03:29.849> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
the double set of bits is very easy to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.670 
the double set of bits is very easy to
pop<00:03:30.239> off<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.900> its<00:03:31.019> easy<00:03:31.170> connection

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
pop off because of its easy connection

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.259 
pop off because of its easy connection
here<00:03:31.859> but<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:32.430> you're<00:03:32.549> taking<00:03:32.819> this<00:03:32.970> blue

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
here but when you're taking this blue

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.789 
here but when you're taking this blue
part<00:03:33.480> off<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> be<00:03:34.079> very<00:03:34.410> careful

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
part off you have to be very careful

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.050 
part off you have to be very careful
because<00:03:34.829> it's<00:03:35.130> actually<00:03:35.280> clamped<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:35.910> there

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
because it's actually clamped in there

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.270 
because it's actually clamped in there
quite<00:03:36.420> well<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.650> may<00:03:37.769> want<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.010> take<00:03:38.160> these

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
quite well so you may want to take these

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.099 
quite well so you may want to take these
green<00:03:38.549> parts<00:03:38.819> off<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.359> before<00:03:39.690> trying

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
green parts off but right before trying

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.470 
green parts off but right before trying
to<00:03:40.200> dislodge<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.120> really

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
to dislodge this this is really

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.789 
to dislodge this this is really
something<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:42.810> not<00:03:43.109> going<00:03:43.349> to<00:03:43.410> feel<00:03:43.590> good

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
something that's not going to feel good

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.559 
something that's not going to feel good
going<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.700> off<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.180> may<00:03:45.299> feel<00:03:45.510> like

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
going on and off and you may feel like

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.800 
going on and off and you may feel like
this<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.319> break<00:03:46.470> very<00:03:46.950> very<00:03:47.280> easily

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
this is going to break very very easily

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.210 
this is going to break very very easily
with<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> side<00:03:49.139> bits<00:03:49.380> off<00:03:49.530> though<00:03:49.769> they<00:03:50.010> have

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
with the side bits off though they have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.800 
with the side bits off though they have
a<00:03:50.250> handle<00:03:50.669> in<00:03:50.790> here<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.150> bends<00:03:51.359> down<00:03:51.599> nicely

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
a handle in here that bends down nicely

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.080 
a handle in here that bends down nicely
and<00:03:52.169> fits<00:03:52.829> in<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.130> turn<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.489> into<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.819> fairly

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
and fits in to turn this into a fairly

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.659 
and fits in to turn this into a fairly
cool-looking<00:03:54.690> weapon<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.680> attach<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.250> also

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
cool-looking weapon the attach to also

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.900 
cool-looking weapon the attach to also
you<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.970> see<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.389> they<00:03:57.510> slide<00:03:57.900> apart<00:03:58.230> here

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
you can see that they slide apart here

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.759 
you can see that they slide apart here
with<00:03:59.910> not<00:04:00.180> too<00:04:00.419> much<00:04:00.569> difficulty<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.380> if<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
with not too much difficulty and if you

with not too much difficulty and if you
get<00:04:01.919> this<00:04:02.069> out<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> way<00:04:02.609> then<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.120> have

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
get this out of the way then you have

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.020 
get this out of the way then you have
this<00:04:03.750> as<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.109> small<00:04:04.709> blade<00:04:05.099> type<00:04:05.400> weapon<00:04:05.849> with<00:04:06.000> a

handle down here and with this top on

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.339 
handle down here and with this top on
you're<00:04:08.430> also<00:04:08.639> again<00:04:09.120> able<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.690> swing<00:04:10.079> this

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
you're also again able to swing this

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.550 
you're also again able to swing this
part<00:04:10.769> down<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.760> when<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.569> that<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.410> get

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
part down and when you do that you get

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
part down and when you do that you get
another<00:04:13.829> weapon<00:04:14.250> although<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.639> one<00:04:14.849> has<00:04:15.000> a

little bit more of knobs etc sticking
out<00:04:17.430> which<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.669> going<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.880> be<00:04:17.970> used<00:04:18.180> when<00:04:18.329> you

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
out which is going to be used when you

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.599 
out which is going to be used when you
put<00:04:18.599> this<00:04:18.690> into<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.019> Buster<00:04:19.380> forms<00:04:19.709> the

you're<00:04:24.270> going<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.419> have<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.690> bend<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.990> down<00:04:25.140> so

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
you're going to have to bend it down so

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.010 
you're going to have to bend it down so
that<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.590> hole<00:04:25.800> is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
that the hole is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.540 
that the hole is
at<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.199> bottom<00:04:26.349> and<00:04:26.680> you're<00:04:27.160> probably<00:04:27.280> going

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
at the bottom and you're probably going

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.770 
at the bottom and you're probably going
to<00:04:27.639> need<00:04:27.759> something<00:04:28.000> like<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> toothpick<00:04:28.720> or

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
to need something like a toothpick or

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.210 
to need something like a toothpick or
your<00:04:29.020> modelers<00:04:29.379> knife<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.740> fish<00:04:29.979> that<00:04:30.190> out

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
your modelers knife to fish that out

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.010 
your modelers knife to fish that out
later<00:04:30.520> when<00:04:30.789> you<00:04:30.940> need<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.240> reattach<00:04:31.449> it<00:04:31.870> a

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
later when you need to reattach it a

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.839 
later when you need to reattach it a
little<00:04:32.590> hard<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.889> make<00:04:32.919> out<00:04:33.190> but<00:04:33.220> there's<00:04:33.520> very

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
little hard to make out but there's very

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.809 
little hard to make out but there's very
tiny<00:04:34.750> little<00:04:35.020> notches<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:36.490> what<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.699> do

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
tiny little notches here and what you do

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.430 
tiny little notches here and what you do
is<00:04:36.909> you<00:04:37.000> end<00:04:37.120> up<00:04:37.180> putting<00:04:37.360> these<00:04:37.569> ridges<00:04:38.289> along

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
is you end up putting these ridges along

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.529 
is you end up putting these ridges along
those<00:04:38.740> there<00:04:39.159> and<00:04:39.370> they<00:04:39.819> actually<00:04:39.970> stay<00:04:40.389> in

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
those there and they actually stay in

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.930 
those there and they actually stay in
place<00:04:40.780> quite<00:04:41.440> solidly<00:04:41.800> once<00:04:42.099> it's<00:04:42.280> attached

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
place quite solidly once it's attached

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.180 
place quite solidly once it's attached
you<00:04:43.509> also<00:04:43.690> clamp<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.169> into<00:04:44.289> place<00:04:44.409> here<00:04:44.919> at<00:04:45.099> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
you also clamp it into place here at the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.950 
you also clamp it into place here at the
bottom<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.639> then<00:04:45.970> these<00:04:46.150> pegs<00:04:46.509> are<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.780> top

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
bottom and then these pegs are the top

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.080 
bottom and then these pegs are the top
are<00:04:47.139> offset<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:48.099> that<00:04:48.129> will<00:04:48.430> seal<00:04:48.669> up<00:04:48.819> nicely

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
are offset so that will seal up nicely

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.390 
are offset so that will seal up nicely
on<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:50.560> bit<00:04:50.800> you'll<00:04:50.949> notice<00:04:50.979> that<00:04:51.280> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
on this bit you'll notice that the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.189 
on this bit you'll notice that the
handle<00:04:51.849> when<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.060> goes<00:04:52.180> down<00:04:52.360> below<00:04:52.629> protrudes

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
handle when it goes down below protrudes

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.230 
handle when it goes down below protrudes
ever<00:04:53.409> so<00:04:53.650> slightly<00:04:53.949> which<00:04:54.639> is<00:04:54.789> important

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
ever so slightly which is important

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.339 
ever so slightly which is important
because<00:04:55.300> when<00:04:55.569> you're<00:04:55.659> attaching<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.229> on

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
because when you're attaching it on

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.649 
because when you're attaching it on
there's<00:04:57.039> a<00:04:57.129> notch<00:04:57.370> there<00:04:57.729> that<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.150> slide

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
there's a notch there that you slide

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.200 
there's a notch there that you slide
this<00:04:58.900> into<00:04:59.199> place<00:04:59.470> then<00:05:00.099> this<00:05:00.460> will<00:05:00.729> lock<00:05:00.909> in

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
this into place then this will lock in

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.670 
this into place then this will lock in
it<00:05:01.419> doesn't<00:05:01.720> quite<00:05:01.780> lock<00:05:02.080> but<00:05:02.259> it<00:05:02.349> stays<00:05:02.560> in

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
it doesn't quite lock but it stays in

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.010 
it doesn't quite lock but it stays in
place<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.099> then<00:05:03.190> we're<00:05:03.340> going<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> have

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
place and then we're going to have

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.390 
place and then we're going to have
you're<00:05:05.020> going<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:05.349> have<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.500> completed<00:05:05.949> Buster

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
you're going to have a completed Buster

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.020 
you're going to have a completed Buster
sword<00:05:06.699> and<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.659> thing<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.650> monster<00:05:12.030> since

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
sword and that thing is a monster since

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.309 
sword and that thing is a monster since
there<00:05:13.210> aren't<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.449> lot<00:05:13.569> of<00:05:13.630> poses<00:05:14.050> where<00:05:14.229> this

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
there aren't a lot of poses where this

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.050 
there aren't a lot of poses where this
is<00:05:14.500> going<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.710> stay<00:05:14.889> up<00:05:14.979> in<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.159> natural<00:05:15.340> form<00:05:15.819> if

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
is going to stay up in a natural form if

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.600 
is going to stay up in a natural form if
you<00:05:16.479> use<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.960> action<00:05:17.289> base<00:05:17.830> with<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.400> part

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
you use this action base with this part

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.670 
you use this action base with this part
pointing<00:05:19.000> forward<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:19.539> has<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.080> hole<00:05:20.380> there

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
pointing forward it has a hole there

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.529 
pointing forward it has a hole there
that<00:05:20.889> you<00:05:21.400> can<00:05:21.550> lock<00:05:21.699> it<00:05:21.849> into<00:05:21.969> place<00:05:22.180> and

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
that you can lock it into place and

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.809 
that you can lock it into place and
hopefully<00:05:23.080> with<00:05:23.409> that<00:05:23.440> in<00:05:23.710> hand<00:05:24.009> you're<00:05:24.639> going

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
hopefully with that in hand you're going

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.309 
hopefully with that in hand you're going
to<00:05:24.969> have<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.120> lot<00:05:25.419> less<00:05:25.449> weight<00:05:26.319> issues<00:05:28.319> after

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
to have a lot less weight issues after

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.540 
to have a lot less weight issues after
moving<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.680> handle<00:05:29.979> into<00:05:30.219> the<00:05:30.310> correct

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
is that the where these two bits are

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.749 
is that the where these two bits are
attached<00:05:34.690> you<00:05:35.409> detach<00:05:35.830> them<00:05:36.159> from<00:05:36.190> each<00:05:36.550> other

that<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.270> handle<00:05:46.659> is<00:05:46.750> turned<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:47.229> you<00:05:47.319> can<00:05:47.469> use

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
that the handle is turned so you can use

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.439 
that the handle is turned so you can use
the<00:05:47.770> action<00:05:48.009> base<00:05:48.219> to<00:05:48.430> keep<00:05:48.610> this<00:05:48.819> set<00:05:49.060> up<00:05:49.210> as<00:05:49.389> a

blaster which five seconds of spoilers

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.600 
blaster which five seconds of spoilers
set<00:05:52.960> then<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.169> uses<00:05:53.319> the<00:05:53.500> blaster<00:05:53.949> a<00:05:53.979> lot<00:05:54.279> more

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
set then it uses the blaster a lot more

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.339

though<00:06:06.880> of<00:06:07.090> this<00:06:07.270> Gundam<00:06:07.719> so<00:06:07.960> far<00:06:08.229> is<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.949> head

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
though of this Gundam so far is the head

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.920 
though of this Gundam so far is the head
but<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.029> only<00:06:10.150> complaint<00:06:10.539> being<00:06:10.690> that<00:06:10.840> it

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
but the only complaint being that it

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.899 
but the only complaint being that it
seems<00:06:11.139> like<00:06:11.349> the<00:06:11.500> neck<00:06:11.740> is<00:06:11.919> a<00:06:11.949> little<00:06:12.039> bit<00:06:12.370> too

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
seems like the neck is a little bit too

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.089 
seems like the neck is a little bit too
long<00:06:13.180> but<00:06:13.539> that<00:06:13.659> may<00:06:13.870> get<00:06:14.380> fixed<00:06:14.740> up<00:06:14.800> once<00:06:15.009> it

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
long but that may get fixed up once it

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.680 
long but that may get fixed up once it
gets<00:06:15.219> his<00:06:15.370> shoulders<00:06:15.789> on<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.270> huge

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
gets his shoulders on and the huge

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.529 
gets his shoulders on and the huge
shield<00:06:17.469> so<00:06:18.340> why<00:06:18.490> do<00:06:18.550> I<00:06:18.669> like<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:19.029> well<00:06:19.210> first<00:06:19.419> of

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
shield so why do I like it well first of

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:20.790 
shield so why do I like it well first of
all<00:06:19.569> you've<00:06:19.750> got<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:19.990> white<00:06:20.169> faceplate<00:06:20.680> with

all you've got the white faceplate with
a<00:06:20.860> good<00:06:21.099> channel<00:06:21.400> if<00:06:21.490> you<00:06:21.580> want<00:06:21.729> to<00:06:21.789> put<00:06:21.909> in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
a good channel if you want to put in

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.700 
a good channel if you want to put in
some<00:06:22.210> black<00:06:22.389> lining<00:06:22.659> there<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.139> red<00:06:23.319> goatee

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
some black lining there the red goatee

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.529 
some black lining there the red goatee
provides<00:06:24.130> also<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.580> under<00:06:24.969> the<00:06:25.090> eyebrows

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
provides also the under the eyebrows

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.659 
provides also the under the eyebrows
there<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.380> what<00:06:26.740> I<00:06:26.770> did<00:06:27.009> is<00:06:27.099> I<00:06:27.190> ended<00:06:27.370> up<00:06:27.460> using

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
there and what I did is I ended up using

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.490 
there and what I did is I ended up using
just<00:06:27.789> the<00:06:28.000> green<00:06:28.240> stickers<00:06:28.659> on<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.080> green

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
just the green stickers on the green

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.809 
just the green stickers on the green
part<00:06:29.860> and<00:06:30.009> I<00:06:30.069> was<00:06:30.190> hoping<00:06:30.400> that<00:06:30.460> you'd<00:06:30.669> get

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
part and I was hoping that you'd get

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.059 
part and I was hoping that you'd get
some<00:06:31.000> light<00:06:31.240> piping<00:06:31.690> through<00:06:31.870> there<00:06:32.110> but<00:06:32.919> you

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 
some light piping through there but you

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.680 
some light piping through there but you
don't<00:06:33.219> actually<00:06:33.400> get<00:06:33.639> any<00:06:33.699> any<00:06:33.969> effect<00:06:34.360> but

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
don't actually get any any effect but

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.620 
don't actually get any any effect but
the<00:06:34.899> dark<00:06:35.680> green<00:06:36.159> plastic<00:06:36.820> there<00:06:37.029> really

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
the dark green plastic there really

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.390 
the dark green plastic there really
comes<00:06:37.930> across<00:06:38.050> as<00:06:38.409> being<00:06:38.620> black

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
comes across as being black

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.710 
comes across as being black
but<00:06:39.669> it's<00:06:39.790> the<00:06:39.880> little<00:06:39.970> details<00:06:40.419> that<00:06:40.509> you've

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
but it's the little details that you've

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.960 
but it's the little details that you've
got<00:06:40.900> these<00:06:41.050> gray<00:06:41.710> parts<00:06:42.130> here<00:06:42.370> before<00:06:42.699> you<00:06:42.790> put

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
got these gray parts here before you put

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.640 
got these gray parts here before you put
the<00:06:43.060> white<00:06:43.210> parts<00:06:43.540> on<00:06:43.690> then<00:06:44.229> you<00:06:44.350> put<00:06:44.560> the

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
the white parts on then you put the

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.930 
the white parts on then you put the
sticker<00:06:44.889> on<00:06:44.979> and<00:06:45.250> then<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:45.430> put<00:06:45.580> the<00:06:45.669> green

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
sticker on and then you put the green

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.960 
sticker on and then you put the green
parts<00:06:46.270> on<00:06:46.419> which<00:06:47.080> just<00:06:47.380> add<00:06:47.590> a<00:06:47.620> level<00:06:48.190> of<00:06:48.370> depth

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
parts on which just add a level of depth

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.219 
parts on which just add a level of depth
and<00:06:49.240> something<00:06:49.810> I<00:06:49.870> haven't<00:06:50.139> mentioned

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
and something I haven't mentioned

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:51.870 
and something I haven't mentioned
earlier<00:06:50.680> is<00:06:50.740> that<00:06:50.800> there's<00:06:51.100> writing<00:06:51.460> on<00:06:51.490> the

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
earlier is that there's writing on the

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.999 
earlier is that there's writing on the
green<00:06:52.090> parts<00:06:52.389> and<00:06:52.570> the<00:06:53.139> writing<00:06:53.470> matches<00:06:53.590> the

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
green parts and the writing matches the

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.950 
green parts and the writing matches the
stickers<00:06:54.400> but<00:06:55.030> because<00:06:55.300> it's<00:06:55.449> separated<00:06:55.840> by<00:06:55.930> a

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
stickers but because it's separated by a

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.810 
stickers but because it's separated by a
few<00:06:56.050> millimeters<00:06:56.380> you<00:06:56.710> actually<00:06:57.130> have<00:06:57.250> a<00:06:57.280> 3d

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
few millimeters you actually have a 3d

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.700 
few millimeters you actually have a 3d
effect<00:06:57.940> with<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.479> writing<00:06:58.810> and<00:06:58.960> it<00:06:59.500> looks

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
effect with the writing and it looks

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.680 
effect with the writing and it looks
very<00:07:00.160> very<00:07:00.370> good<00:07:00.699> and<00:07:00.940> that<00:07:00.970> doesn't<00:07:01.600> come

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
very very good and that doesn't come

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.900 
very very good and that doesn't come
across<00:07:01.960> anywhere<00:07:02.350> more<00:07:02.590> clearly<00:07:02.949> than<00:07:03.639> on<00:07:03.789> the

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
across anywhere more clearly than on the

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.189 
across anywhere more clearly than on the
head<00:07:04.090> where<00:07:04.270> this<00:07:04.389> blue<00:07:04.690> part<00:07:04.840> on<00:07:04.960> the<00:07:05.050> white

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
head where this blue part on the white

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.870 
head where this blue part on the white
part<00:07:05.440> fit<00:07:05.620> together<00:07:05.860> well<00:07:06.070> you<00:07:06.130> put<00:07:06.490> the<00:07:06.580> black

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
part fit together well you put the black

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.029 
part fit together well you put the black
seal<00:07:07.389> which<00:07:08.050> goes<00:07:08.259> across<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:08.710> two<00:07:08.830> of<00:07:08.949> them

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
seal which goes across the two of them

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.830 
seal which goes across the two of them
and<00:07:09.190> when<00:07:09.699> you<00:07:09.759> put<00:07:09.880> in<00:07:09.970> that<00:07:10.000> green<00:07:10.330> part<00:07:10.360> the

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
and when you put in that green part the

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.080 
and when you put in that green part the
letters<00:07:11.169> double<00:07:11.620> or<00:07:11.830> the<00:07:12.250> numbers<00:07:12.580> double<00:07:12.970> O

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
letters double or the numbers double O

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.350 
letters double or the numbers double O
and<00:07:13.360> the<00:07:13.419> letter<00:07:13.600> Q<00:07:13.960> look<00:07:14.740> great<00:07:15.430> so<00:07:16.060> a<00:07:16.090> little

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 
and the letter Q look great so a little

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.939 
and the letter Q look great so a little
bit<00:07:16.449> of<00:07:16.539> lining<00:07:16.900> and<00:07:17.050> these<00:07:17.169> blue<00:07:17.440> parts<00:07:17.800> on

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949 
bit of lining and these blue parts on

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.129 
bit of lining and these blue parts on
here<00:07:18.250> look<00:07:18.430> very<00:07:18.850> good<00:07:19.150> and<00:07:19.419> outside<00:07:19.990> of<00:07:20.020> the

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
here look very good and outside of the

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.409 
here look very good and outside of the
lack<00:07:20.289> of<00:07:20.320> light<00:07:20.680> piping<00:07:21.130> I<00:07:21.310> think<00:07:21.910> that's<00:07:22.120> the

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
lack of light piping I think that's the

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:27.330 
lack of light piping I think that's the
highlight<00:07:22.870> of<00:07:23.080> the<00:07:23.620> night<00:07:25.740> that<00:07:26.740> wraps<00:07:27.010> up<00:07:27.190> my

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
highlight of the night that wraps up my

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.680 
highlight of the night that wraps up my
look<00:07:27.520> at<00:07:27.669> the<00:07:27.729> parts<00:07:28.030> so<00:07:28.180> why<00:07:28.300> don't<00:07:28.479> you<00:07:28.539> let

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
look at the parts so why don't you let

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.870 
look at the parts so why don't you let
me<00:07:28.870> know<00:07:28.900> what<00:07:29.229> you<00:07:29.350> think<00:07:29.560> down<00:07:29.830> below<00:07:29.889> so<00:07:30.580> far

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.820 
me know what you think down below so far
things<00:07:31.510> that<00:07:31.660> are<00:07:31.780> disappointing<00:07:32.410> in<00:07:32.650> the

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
things that are disappointing in the

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.529 
things that are disappointing in the
parts<00:07:33.130> of<00:07:33.280> the<00:07:33.370> inner<00:07:33.520> frame<00:07:33.820> or<00:07:34.090> the<00:07:34.180> weapons

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539 
parts of the inner frame or the weapons

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.719 
parts of the inner frame or the weapons
so<00:07:35.199> for<00:07:35.380> my<00:07:35.530> big<00:07:35.740> complaint<00:07:36.099> is<00:07:36.250> really<00:07:36.490> just

so for my big complaint is really just

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.760 
so for my big complaint is really just
that<00:07:36.910> with<00:07:37.090> how<00:07:37.210> finicky<00:07:37.479> it<00:07:37.780> is<00:07:37.930> to<00:07:38.169> get<00:07:38.410> the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
that with how finicky it is to get the

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.339 
that with how finicky it is to get the
bits<00:07:39.099> off<00:07:39.340> of<00:07:39.699> the<00:07:39.820> shield<00:07:40.180> but<00:07:40.960> outside<00:07:41.229> of
