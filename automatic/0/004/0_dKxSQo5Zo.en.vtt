experience<00:00:54.040> with<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.309> mCP<00:00:54.760> X<00:00:54.910> has<00:00:55.059> been

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
experience with the mCP X has been

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.930 
experience with the mCP X has been
pretty<00:00:55.540> abysmal<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:57.070> one<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.980> flew<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.130> for<00:01:00.489> I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
pretty abysmal for one I flew it for I

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.810 
pretty abysmal for one I flew it for I
would<00:01:01.270> guess<00:01:01.510> five<00:01:01.809> six<00:01:02.489> less<00:01:03.489> than<00:01:03.610> ten

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820
