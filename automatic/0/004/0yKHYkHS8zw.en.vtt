00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:14.850 

okay<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.290> whole<00:02:02.470> idea<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:13.200> okay<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.710> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
okay and the whole idea is to okay so in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.440 
okay and the whole idea is to okay so in
this<00:02:14.950> particular<00:02:15.280> case<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.000> glass<00:02:16.420> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
this particular case this is glass and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.320 
this particular case this is glass and
with<00:02:16.900> some<00:02:17.020> silver<00:02:17.470> surface<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.030> let's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
with some silver surface and so let's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.630 
with some silver surface and so let's
just<00:02:19.420> say<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.140> we're<00:02:20.530> gong<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.770> use<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.460> is

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
just say that we're gong to use this is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.550 
just say that we're gong to use this is
the<00:02:21.760> top<00:02:21.970> view<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.080> where<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> lights

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the top view this is where the lights

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 
the top view this is where the lights
are<00:02:23.740> coming<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.610> then<00:02:24.790> striking<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
are coming in and then striking the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.130 
are coming in and then striking the
mirror<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:26.610> right<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.790> size<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.420> it's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
mirror just right in size like that it's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.750 
mirror just right in size like that it's
important<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> understand<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
important for you to understand that the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.699 
important for you to understand that the
headlights<00:02:31.420> coming<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.320> then<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.470> light

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
headlights coming in and then the light

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.090 
headlights coming in and then the light
bouncing<00:02:33.220> back<00:02:33.400> into<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.820> person's<00:02:34.270> eyes<00:02:35.100> are

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
bouncing back into the person's eyes are

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100 
bouncing back into the person's eyes are
coming<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.820> different<00:02:37.150> angle<00:02:37.300> because<00:02:37.810> this

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
coming in a different angle because this

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
coming in a different angle because this
particular<00:02:38.320> diagram<00:02:39.040> will<00:02:39.280> become<00:02:39.610> confusing

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
particular diagram will become confusing

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.150 
particular diagram will become confusing
if<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.330> don't<00:02:40.570> realize<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.650> this

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
if you don't realize that so this

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.100 
if you don't realize that so this
represents<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.850> headlights<00:02:43.330> coming<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.900> like

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
represents the headlights coming in like

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.590 
represents the headlights coming in like
this<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.410> they<00:02:44.709> strike<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> front<00:02:45.250> surface

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
this and they strike the front surface

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.820 
this and they strike the front surface
and<00:02:46.600> then<00:02:46.750> reflect<00:02:47.110> off<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.500> front<00:02:47.739> surface

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
and then reflect off the front surface

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.000 
and then reflect off the front surface
but<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.489> reflection<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.239> fairly<00:02:49.510> weak

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
but the reflection is fairly weak

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.260 
but the reflection is fairly weak
because<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.370> bouncing<00:02:51.790> off<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.060> front

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
because it's bouncing off the front

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.350 
because it's bouncing off the front
surface<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.980> light<00:02:54.160> continues<00:02:54.550> on<00:02:55.000> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
surface then the light continues on and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.740 
surface then the light continues on and
strikes<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.959> mirror<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.300> reflects<00:02:58.300> off<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
strikes the mirror and reflects off the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.930 
strikes the mirror and reflects off the
mirror<00:02:58.989> almost<00:02:59.380> as<00:02:59.590> strong<00:02:59.920> as<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.700> first

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
mirror almost as strong as in the first

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.210 
mirror almost as strong as in the first
place<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.480> then<00:03:01.870> comes<00:03:02.140> back<00:03:02.260> refraction

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
place and then comes back refraction

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.680 
place and then comes back refraction
there<00:03:03.370> but<00:03:03.520> I'm<00:03:03.580> ignoring<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.180> just<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.540> make

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
there but I'm ignoring that just to make

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.960 
there but I'm ignoring that just to make
the<00:03:04.900> argument<00:03:05.500> easier<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.070> then<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the argument easier and then this is the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.940 
the argument easier and then this is the
right<00:03:07.180> stuff<00:03:07.480> coming<00:03:07.870> back<00:03:08.110> at<00:03:08.350> an<00:03:08.470> angle<00:03:08.590> off

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
right stuff coming back at an angle off

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.070 
right stuff coming back at an angle off
in<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.280> direction<00:03:09.550> into<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> person's<00:03:10.900> eyes

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
in that direction into the person's eyes

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.979 
in that direction into the person's eyes
and<00:03:11.590> that's<00:03:12.160> what<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.580> see<00:03:12.790> ordinarily<00:03:13.570> when

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
and that's what you see ordinarily when

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:14.500 
and that's what you see ordinarily when
you<00:03:14.020> have

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
you have

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.380 
you have
adjusting<00:03:15.170> okay<00:03:15.489> now<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.760> turns<00:03:16.970> out<00:03:17.180> if

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
adjusting okay now it turns out if

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.210 
adjusting okay now it turns out if
someone<00:03:17.780> comes<00:03:17.989> behind<00:03:18.409> at<00:03:18.620> nighttime<00:03:18.830> and

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
someone comes behind at nighttime and

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.250 
someone comes behind at nighttime and
shines<00:03:19.459> bright<00:03:19.760> lights<00:03:20.000> into<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
shines bright lights into this so you

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.160 
shines bright lights into this so you
taken<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:22.099> move<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:22.909> button<00:03:23.330> and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
taken you move this little button and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.390 
taken you move this little button and
when<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:24.409> move<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:24.680> little<00:03:24.950> button<00:03:25.159> it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
when you move this little button it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.050 
when you move this little button it
moves<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.940> one<00:03:26.239> down<00:03:26.450> into<00:03:26.900> position<00:03:27.379> and

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
moves this one down into position and

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.839 
moves this one down into position and
moves<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.420> this<00:03:29.569> back<00:03:29.900> one<00:03:30.280> back<00:03:31.280> up<00:03:31.580> at<00:03:31.760> an

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
moves to this back one back up at an

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.650 
moves to this back one back up at an
angle<00:03:32.000> like<00:03:32.330> this<00:03:32.980> okay<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.040> now<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.760> one<00:03:35.030> is

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
angle like this okay so now this one is

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.420 
angle like this okay so now this one is
in<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> same<00:03:36.170> plane<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.920> one<00:03:37.099> needs<00:03:37.310> to

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
in the same plane that this one needs to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.720 
in the same plane that this one needs to
be<00:03:37.580> okay<00:03:38.360> now<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> right<00:03:39.890> light<00:03:40.310> comes

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
be okay now the right light comes

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.509 
be okay now the right light comes
through<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.510> bounces<00:03:42.290> off<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.829> the

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
through and bounces off of this the

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.430 
through and bounces off of this the
bouncing<00:03:43.970> off<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.480> because<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.200> is

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
bouncing off of that because this is

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.580 
bouncing off of that because this is
glass<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.670> has<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:46.879> much<00:03:47.180> weaker<00:03:47.450> reflection<00:03:48.319> so

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
glass it has a much weaker reflection so

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.280 
glass it has a much weaker reflection so
it<00:03:48.739> goes<00:03:48.950> back<00:03:49.220> into<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.549> guys<00:03:49.900> okay<00:03:50.900> but

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
it goes back into the guys okay but

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.110 
it goes back into the guys okay but
meanwhile<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.980> one<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.370> goes<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:52.940> a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
meanwhile this one that goes and just a

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.300 
meanwhile this one that goes and just a
mirror<00:03:53.450> there<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.170> then<00:03:54.739> bounces<00:03:55.160> off

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
mirror there and then bounces off

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:04.119 
mirror there and then bounces off
without<00:03:55.459> mirror<00:03:55.849> there<00:04:01.180> okay<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.680> right

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
without mirror there okay so the right

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.580 
without mirror there okay so the right
one<00:04:04.400> goes<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.910> there<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.480> there's<00:04:05.989> refraction

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
one goes up there and there's refraction

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.800 
one goes up there and there's refraction
here<00:04:06.799> but<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.129> right<00:04:07.340> one<00:04:07.549> goes<00:04:07.700> off<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.690> that

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
here but the right one goes off in that

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.900 
here but the right one goes off in that
direction<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.799> is<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:10.010> bright<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.609> where

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
direction this is the bright one where

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.520 
direction this is the bright one where
this<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.390> bright<00:04:11.569> one<00:04:11.780> before<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.379> now

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
this is the bright one before and now

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.979 
this is the bright one before and now
this<00:04:12.709> is<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:13.010> demo<00:04:13.220> okay<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.599> bright<00:04:14.780> one

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
this is the demo okay so the bright one

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.490 
this is the demo okay so the bright one
goes<00:04:15.140> off<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.920> direction<00:04:16.130> away<00:04:16.519> from<00:04:16.639> the

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
goes off in the direction away from the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.319 
goes off in the direction away from the
box<00:04:18.500> there's<00:04:19.489> other<00:04:19.669> things<00:04:19.729> going<00:04:20.090> on<00:04:20.269> in

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
box there's other things going on in

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.629 
box there's other things going on in
there<00:04:20.539> too<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.750> in<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.109> article<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:22.070> explained

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
there too and in the article I explained

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.490 
there too and in the article I explained
the<00:04:22.820> fact<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:23.360> continues<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.229> another

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the fact that this continues and another

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.469 
the fact that this continues and another
thing<00:04:24.770> happens<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:25.460> all<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:25.760> stuff<00:04:26.030> too

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
thing happens and all of that stuff too

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.200 
thing happens and all of that stuff too
okay<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:28.639> have<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.820> basic<00:04:29.270> idea<00:04:30.970> now<00:04:31.970> it's

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
okay so you have the basic idea now it's

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.540 
okay so you have the basic idea now it's
time<00:04:32.419> for<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.750> demonstration<00:04:33.560> okay<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
time for the demonstration okay and

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.570 
time for the demonstration okay and
here's<00:04:34.849> the<00:04:35.000> demonstration<00:04:35.750> okay<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:37.370> we<00:04:37.490> have

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
here's the demonstration okay so we have

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.860 
here's the demonstration okay so we have
a<00:04:37.610> laser<00:04:37.849> here<00:04:38.690> we<00:04:39.440> have<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.620> mirror<00:04:39.950> here<00:04:40.720> okay

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
a laser here we have a mirror here okay

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.680 
a laser here we have a mirror here okay
and<00:04:41.960> then<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:42.979> mirror<00:04:43.310> clamp<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.570> we

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
and then we have this mirror clamp so we

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.830 
and then we have this mirror clamp so we
can<00:04:44.900> adjust<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.650> like<00:04:46.039> this<00:04:46.310> okay<00:04:46.970> now<00:04:47.630> I'm

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
can adjust it like this okay now I'm

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.650 
can adjust it like this okay now I'm
hoping<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.830> can<00:04:48.889> line<00:04:49.250> it<00:04:49.280> up<00:04:49.599> would<00:04:50.599> be

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
hoping that I can line it up would be

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.810 
hoping that I can line it up would be
better<00:04:50.990> on<00:04:51.260> white<00:04:51.590> let's<00:04:52.220> see<00:04:52.370> if<00:04:52.430> I<00:04:52.520> can<00:04:52.700> get

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
better on white let's see if I can get

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.900 
better on white let's see if I can get
it<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.139> someone's<00:04:54.139> eyes<00:04:54.400> not<00:04:55.400> gonna<00:04:55.580> get<00:04:55.760> that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
it to someone's eyes not gonna get that

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.159 
it to someone's eyes not gonna get that
way<00:04:56.150> making<00:04:56.450> sure<00:04:57.610> okay<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.720> real<00:04:59.900> the

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
way making sure okay so the real the

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.540 
way making sure okay so the real the
first<00:05:00.289> time<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.560> did<00:05:00.889> this<00:05:01.039> in<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.280> class<00:05:01.520> of

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
first time I did this in a class of

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.060 
first time I did this in a class of
course<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.090> hadn't<00:05:02.360> really<00:05:02.539> tried<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.620> my

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
course I hadn't really tried it and my

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.590 
course I hadn't really tried it and my
hand<00:05:04.340> kept<00:05:04.639> getting<00:05:04.940> away

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
hand kept getting away

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.120 
hand kept getting away
what<00:05:05.750> happened<00:05:06.110> where<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.380> go<00:05:06.560> well<00:05:06.800> one<00:05:07.040> of

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
what happened where to go well one of

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.530 
what happened where to go well one of
these<00:05:07.250> little<00:05:07.460> things<00:05:07.670> right<00:05:07.850> here<00:05:08.180> if<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.420> do

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
these little things right here if you do

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.700 
these little things right here if you do
it<00:05:08.660> right<00:05:10.810> okay<00:05:11.810> see<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.740> law<00:05:13.630> okay<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:15.530> is

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
it right okay see the law okay this is

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.180 
it right okay see the law okay this is
the<00:05:15.920> main<00:05:16.280> reflection<00:05:16.940> now<00:05:17.930> there's<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:18.860> little

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
the main reflection now there's a little

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.190 
the main reflection now there's a little
you<00:05:19.760> have<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.000> explain<00:05:20.420> but<00:05:21.020> that's

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
you have to explain but that's

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.620 
you have to explain but that's
definitely<00:05:21.440> dimmer<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.850> that's<00:05:23.300> definitely

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
definitely dimmer and that's definitely

that's daytime and that's nighttime but

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.560 
that's daytime and that's nighttime but
one<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.530> really<00:05:46.010> brilliant<00:05:46.310> things<00:05:47.060> about

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
one of the really brilliant things about

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.680 
one of the really brilliant things about
the<00:05:47.780> way<00:05:47.930> this<00:05:48.140> was<00:05:48.200> designed<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.300> makes<00:05:50.480> no

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
the way this was designed is it makes no

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.270 
the way this was designed is it makes no
difference<00:05:50.720> if<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.380> button<00:05:51.710> is<00:05:51.800> forward<00:05:52.250> and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
difference if the button is forward and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.250 
difference if the button is forward and
back<00:05:52.490> when<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.270> adjust<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.840> during<00:05:54.140> the

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
back when you adjust it during the

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.380 
back when you adjust it during the
daytime<00:05:54.650> because<00:05:55.520> when<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:55.970> adjust<00:05:56.210> it

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
daytime because when you adjust it

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.220 
daytime because when you adjust it
during<00:05:56.690> the<00:05:56.810> night

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
during the night

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.680 
during the night
that's<00:05:57.800> it<00:05:58.010> but<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.430> point<00:05:58.580> is<00:05:58.820> that<00:05:59.270> one<00:05:59.660> of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
that's it but the point is that one of

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.500 
that's it but the point is that one of
the<00:05:59.930> two<00:06:00.110> spots<00:06:00.790> will<00:06:01.790> be<00:06:01.970> out<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.180> alignment

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
the two spots will be out of alignment

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.380 
the two spots will be out of alignment
but<00:06:03.470> when<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:03.800> pull<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:04.430> forward<00:06:04.820> or<00:06:05.000> push<00:06:05.240> it

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
but when you pull it forward or push it

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.280 
but when you pull it forward or push it
back<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.810> others<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:06.350> light<00:06:06.560> spot<00:06:06.890> will<00:06:07.130> come
