00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
it seems like every time lately that I

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.980 
it seems like every time lately that I
hear<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.429> news<00:00:02.610> there's<00:00:03.300> something<00:00:03.750> more

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hear the news there's something more

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.140 
hear the news there's something more
about<00:00:04.290> change<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:04.859> health<00:00:05.009> care<00:00:05.250> now<00:00:06.120> I

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
about change in health care now I

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.579 
about change in health care now I
believe<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.720> change<00:00:06.990> when<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.410> talking

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
believe in change when we're talking

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.160 
believe in change when we're talking
about<00:00:07.859> improving<00:00:08.280> processes<00:00:08.639> or<00:00:09.210> creating

safety<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.870> continuous<00:00:16.410> change<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:17.039> be

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
safety but continuous change can be

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
safety but continuous change can be
demoralizing<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:17.820> people<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.930> be

demoralizing for people it can be

demoralizing for people it can be
demoralizing<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.710> our<00:00:19.980> ends<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.460> other

layoffs are stressful and they introduce

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
full-time positions for our ends then

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
full-time positions for our ends then
that<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> real<00:00:50.489> benefit<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> patients

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that will be a real benefit to patients

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.439 
that will be a real benefit to patients
in<00:00:51.629> terms<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> continuity<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.890> care<00:00:53.239> we<00:00:54.239> know

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
in terms of continuity of care we know

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
in terms of continuity of care we know
that<00:00:54.690> when<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.020> create<00:00:55.440> conditions<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that when we create conditions like that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270 
that when we create conditions like that
for<00:00:56.670> better<00:00:56.789> continuity<00:00:57.530> RNs<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
for better continuity RNs do have a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
for better continuity RNs do have a
better<00:00:59.550> opportunity<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.660> create<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
better opportunity to create the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
better opportunity to create the
relationships<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.309> important

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
relationships that are so important

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
relationships that are so important
especially<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> complexity<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> we

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
especially with the complexity that we

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.620 
especially with the complexity that we
know<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> system<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
know is in the system right now

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.660 
know is in the system right now
continuity<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> care<00:01:07.409> also<00:01:08.159> reduces<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
continuity of care also reduces the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.190 
continuity of care also reduces the
number<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> handoffs<00:01:09.390> between<00:01:09.570> providers

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
number of handoffs between providers

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
number of handoffs between providers
which<00:01:10.860> reduces<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> potential<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.970> errors

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
which reduces the potential for errors

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.380 
which reduces the potential for errors
but<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:14.010> still<00:01:14.280> need<00:01:14.340> part<00:01:14.729> time<00:01:14.790> positions

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
but we still need part time positions

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
but we still need part time positions
too<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.100> barriers<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
too we know that there are barriers to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.749 
too we know that there are barriers to
full<00:01:18.270> time<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.930> nurses<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.580> need<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
full time for some nurses so we need a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.899 
full time for some nurses so we need a
better<00:01:21.030> dialogue<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> talks<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
better dialogue one that talks about the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
better dialogue one that talks about the
better<00:01:24.140> approaches<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.560> address<00:01:25.830> those

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
better approaches to address those

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.060 
better approaches to address those
barriers<00:01:26.299> for<00:01:27.299> example<00:01:27.810> many<00:01:28.380> younger<00:01:28.650> nurses

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
barriers for example many younger nurses

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
barriers for example many younger nurses
tell<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.610> juggling<00:01:29.970> work<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.240> childcare

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
tell me that juggling work and childcare

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
tell me that juggling work and childcare
is<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:32.130> challenging<00:01:32.729> especially<00:01:33.329> with

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
is really challenging especially with

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
is really challenging especially with
the<00:01:33.900> reality<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> shift<00:01:34.740> work<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.820> need<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the reality of shift work we need to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
the reality of shift work we need to
shift<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> dialogue<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.380> solutions<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> those

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
shift the dialogue to solutions to those

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
shift the dialogue to solutions to those
barriers<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.880> nurses<00:01:39.270> face<00:01:39.479> rather<00:01:40.350> than

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
barriers that nurses face rather than

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
barriers that nurses face rather than
polarizing<00:01:41.250> us<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> question<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
polarizing us on the question of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.289 
polarizing us on the question of
full-time<00:01:42.840> versus<00:01:43.290> part-time<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:45.030> what

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
full-time versus part-time but what

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
full-time versus part-time but what
really<00:01:45.540> concerns<00:01:45.840> me<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.680> possibility

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
really concerns me is the possibility

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.850 
really concerns me is the possibility
that<00:01:47.520> RN<00:01:48.149> positions<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.649> being

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that RN positions will or are being

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.760 
that RN positions will or are being
eliminated<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.750> substituted<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.899> positions

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
eliminated or substituted with positions

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.429 
eliminated or substituted with positions
for<00:01:53.009> less<00:01:53.189> qualified<00:01:53.610> providers<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.479> course

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
for less qualified providers of course

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.469 
for less qualified providers of course
RNs<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.700> need<00:01:56.880> collaborative
