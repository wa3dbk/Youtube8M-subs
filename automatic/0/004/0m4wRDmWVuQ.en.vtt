00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 work a little leaner and gave 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.589
 two three victories there for 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.940
 Replacement in the league split ball pro game 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.830
 even though I left the game for the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.080
 game because the guys want to see the bullshit 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.119
 People want to see Starcraft 2 and I do not 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.100
 I can reveal otherwise I will catch 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.310
 Look , guys, here, at the game, people. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.519
 sees the beginning of the players being a boy 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 against the quantum player before in two 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.710
 first players of the top players 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 It's really cool to see this game 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.050
 here in the kingdom of the clouds that the map 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.030
 also allowing an initial game of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 high quality will not suggestive will 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 suggest guys play using 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.340
 playing stabbing a map a lot 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.010
 that allows this closure 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.110
 of natural expansion as we are 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 seeing the year without doing it 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.340
 allows the game to be forwarded to the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.289
 most often for a game well 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 very few macro times here a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 cloud barrier 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.559
 You will see a fast game the game was 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 decided in the fright of a determined game in the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.130
 luck you'll usually see here in that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 map a more technical game possible 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 the game package just respected me 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 It's so cool here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 Ball concert is guys am 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.610
 Let's go, let's go on this one because the one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.970
 genetic test here of the ranking thus the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.500
 record of the environment 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 Thank God for what he wrote for 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.240
 behind I do not want to here from inside the game 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.790
 but look there it no longer rapid expansion 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 very fast there the situation here 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.229
 player wanda so he already has two 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.350
 senators of the main base player 0 and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.090
 the basis of it considering the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.369
 put on top to give that channel 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.530
 chic look five minutes to 40 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.090
 here below you have 10 others that will give 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.369
 that look will also suffer some 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 parents of a photon gain with no 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 could no longer be 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.159
 and in the middle of the bush the cockroaches and arriving 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.259
 there because player 0 plays from a base 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.500
 I just said that this map suggests 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.600
 macro games but this map here to the expensive ones 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.569
 will be ignored by the avaÃ­ player 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.350
 which is right at the face right through the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.300
 front and can 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.890
 just watched our protoss it goes 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.900
 to fit a sensational attack on 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.270
 ranking he saw being that the romance 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.460
 had expanded is fast and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.770
 does not open its natural situation the player 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.900
 bligh to go up now to attack the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.310
 base of the protoss player breaking everything 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.420
 here we leave what makes the situation 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.520
 terrible 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.990
 it will pass straight into the base 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.910
 Enemy now arrives with Lucca from 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.190
 mother ship to disrupt that defense 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.740
 to work here the attack of the player 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.960
 of the hai phong sentence defending that the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.570
 sir in the few seconds he has 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.950
 at this moment puts a force field 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.610
 here to try to hold the units 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.560
 enemies 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300
 the photon face attacks the cockroaches 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.650
 waves come now to attack the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.600
 cockroaches to save time 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.210
 at that time the attack of the player of the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.460
 will go to a sim under pressure time 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.990
 whole and does not have the technology 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.670
 portal is not using 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.100
 acquisitions to accelerate their 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.660
 defense what ever the mother ship tries 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.310
 gain energy try to buy time here 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.130
 to be able to defend himself not to stop 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.260
 units the player follows 44 supply 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.140
 problematic against 12 of the ranking 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.170
 the team vencia comes with everything here in this 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.040
 sharing and the map itself is rendered 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.380
 sometimes you see there a totally 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.380
 totally totally aggressive is jÃ´ 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.860
 is
