more on the way the mutants will be

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.600 
more on the way the mutants will be
coming<00:04:28.970> back<00:04:29.240> now<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.680> innovation<00:04:31.490> with

coming back now and innovation with

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.080 
coming back now and innovation with
almost<00:04:31.850> nothing<00:04:32.180> left<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.310> think<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:35.030> is

almost nothing left and I think this is

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:44.730 
almost nothing left and I think this is
the<00:04:35.770> killing<00:04:36.770> blow<00:04:36.950> here<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:39.190> AG
