00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
area it then asked permission of a

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.300 
area it then asked permission of a
soldier<00:02:00.260> back<00:02:00.440> at<00:02:00.619> base<00:02:00.800> whether<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.280> should

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
soldier back at base whether it should

soldier back at base whether it should

fire or not if the soldier grants that

concern is that that permission may not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.570 
concern is that that permission may not
always<00:02:08.090> be<00:02:08.240> required<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.590> robot<00:02:10.220> could

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
always be required that a robot could

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.030 
always be required that a robot could
fire<00:02:10.880> without<00:02:11.300> any<00:02:11.630> human<00:02:11.840> intervention<00:02:12.020> if<00:02:12.920> a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
fire without any human intervention if a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.560 
fire without any human intervention if a
robot<00:02:13.160> goes<00:02:13.580> wrong<00:02:13.820> who's<00:02:14.090> accountable

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
robot goes wrong who's accountable

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.690 
robot goes wrong who's accountable
certainly<00:02:15.140> won't<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.470> robot<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.610> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
certainly won't be the robot but it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820 
certainly won't be the robot but it
could<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.270> commander<00:02:18.170> who<00:02:18.290> sent<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.680> off

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
could be the commander who sent it off

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.670 
could be the commander who sent it off
could<00:02:19.130> be<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.340> manufacturer<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:21.110> could<00:02:21.500> be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
could be the manufacturer it could be

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.229 
could be the manufacturer it could be
the<00:02:21.709> programmer<00:02:22.400> who<00:02:22.610> programmed<00:02:22.850> the

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
the programmer who programmed the

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.690 
the programmer who programmed the
mission<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:24.440> robot<00:02:24.770> could<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.160> bullet<00:02:25.430> in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
mission the robot could take a bullet in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.610 
mission the robot could take a bullet in
its<00:02:25.850> computer<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.570> go<00:02:26.660> berserk<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.470> there's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
its computer and go berserk so there's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.140 
its computer and go berserk so there's
no<00:02:27.770> way<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.280> determining<00:02:28.940> who's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
no way of really determining who's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.030 
no way of really determining who's
accountable<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.930> that's<00:02:30.320> very<00:02:30.530> important

production of these systems needs to be
