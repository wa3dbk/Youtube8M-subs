if it was the color combination or the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.410 
if it was the color combination or the
high<00:07:04.660> neck<00:07:04.920> that<00:07:05.920> just<00:07:06.130> looks<00:07:06.280> like<00:07:06.430> this<00:07:06.640> this

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
high neck that just looks like this this

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.230 
high neck that just looks like this this
one<00:07:07.660> I<00:07:07.690> would<00:07:07.900> probably<00:07:08.050> use<00:07:08.320> more<00:07:08.800> for<00:07:09.240> the

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
one I would probably use more for the

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.820 
one I would probably use more for the
beach<00:07:10.450> and<00:07:10.900> swimming<00:07:11.140> and<00:07:11.410> just<00:07:11.590> kind<00:07:11.770> of

covering up but I think belted this
would<00:07:14.770> also<00:07:14.920> look<00:07:15.130> really<00:07:15.430> cute<00:07:15.640> as<00:07:15.820> well<00:07:15.850> and
