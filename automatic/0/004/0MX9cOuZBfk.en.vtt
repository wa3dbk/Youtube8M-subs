00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.850
 they sure wonder why I'm around 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.320
 I have asked for this meeting 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.130
 my services will not be longer 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.590
 needed 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.080
 Why do you think that 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.520
 Well it was a great pleasure and stuff 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.889
 to buy textiles for you 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.510
 I would have done it anyway, but we did 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.490
 knew it is a test run around the 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.869
 demand and I said after three 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.640
 I would have to do the business either 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.980
 operate professionally or the whole 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 let's stay put, we'll do it 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.310
 professional 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.810

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.300
 my successor I am gladly ready 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.489
 the modest thing we want you to know 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.250
 We are happy to answer the business 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.080
 With them professional they bet 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.519
 have contacts you have taste when 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.059
 she would misbehave his legs 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.710
 give 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.600
 We want you to do our shopping 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.660
 Lead for all our business 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 In this country I am 79 years old 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.230
 I do not mind if they do not make it 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.120
 i mean you get a team that for 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.870
 she works, however , they become much 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.390
 have to travel 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.850
 Good morning I'm just with the object 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.350
 over and over I see well and because of Finn 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.070
 drive the damn thing is again 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.070
 remained lying 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 furthermore, tomorrow the man was without 8 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.530
 plan will still be the best room 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.090
 come 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 Well, that was very uncomfortable, though 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 not enough to trade with you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.900
 but I exchanged yesterday after the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.480
 Dinner 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.990
 how is the new room almost monastic 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.250
 what I like 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 Do not tell the owner about it 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 agree he is gracious though 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 not the brightest he is mine 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 son and what a fine guy are 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.369
 Certainly very proud does not speak 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 the guests marmit 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.830
 No no, it would have to be my level counts 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.660
 how comfortable you are in the hotel I feel 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.950
 am both pleased and around 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:01.729
 Surprised, but I really do not talk 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.729
 We hope see you again next 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.869
 The Marriott hotel is fully booked 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.580
 we have to expand 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.530
 It could be a whole hotel chain 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.750
 India and beyond 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.880
 for such people as this great 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.930
 Talk like the chance to say 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.440
 why die here if I'm there too 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.440
 can die 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.800
 she had to be all this here 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.150
 A dream is coming true 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.830
 if a dream team was on it with her 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.290
 Otherwise they'll never come up again 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.360
 still in a slightly bent state 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.200
 how long have they both been like that? 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.290
 are not together 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.440
 well , we thought we are not nothing 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.240
 together 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.360
 how do we end up with the clip land of 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.690
 the best the culture dennis reason 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.490
 valid with my strengths 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.250
 as soon as he had the things on the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.400
 dance floor and sells its own 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.400
 mother 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.800
 Although we want to give a present to the new 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.070
 whimsical of a tuber to berlin my 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.070
 out 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.830
 What 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.450
 the camera 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.780
 How many times can we re-live our lives 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.780
 organize 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.810
 as often as we want 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.090
 hello dallas hello i am i could 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 The opportunity to resist the opportunity 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.020
 old ruined ruins again too 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.650
 I also wanted to visit the hotel 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.650
