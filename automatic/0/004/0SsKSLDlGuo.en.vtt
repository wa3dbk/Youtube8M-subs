00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 the other day I said on twitter that I 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.009
 I wanted to buy a pet from 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.150
 then read Persian family friends 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.259
 everyone has given me their opinion 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.259
 about that decision 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
 At first I thought about getting hold of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 a Dalmatian puppy and if I'm sincere 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 At first there was no 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 contemplated the possibility of going to a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 kennel and acquire it there but you were 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.460
 you with the tweets that I 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 you left jce clear that go to a kennel 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 it was the only sensible option so I 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.890
 from here I also recommend that option 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.539
 then my friends who know me 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 more closely I was told that it was not a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.620
 good decision and after all a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.960
 dog bears many many many 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.450
 care and I spend very little time in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.280
 house they were also right another 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.050
 thing and that is that I bought it for me 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.850
 I made company and that's not a reason 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 Enough besides a super stance 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.289
 selfish on my part so I once 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 I realized all this discard 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.800
 totally the option to buy me a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 dog at least for now data either 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.109
 it was an option not to be considered because 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.809
 I am asthmatic and cats and cats 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.399
 attract the bad things out and it was not 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.049
 an option and we will not even raise 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.700
 whenever I'm in a house where I 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.170
 there are cats I begin to sting the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.119
 it's outrageous and it happened canada 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 we got to that point I thought of all kinds 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.490
 of animals I thought of a budgie I thought 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.079
 ducks I thought about rabbits already at the end I'll 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 stop with a species that I do not know if 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.490
 you know it's called a petal of sugar 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 that is a rodent that I loved I leave you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 around here a few photos so that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 you see is a loving animal that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.439
 love to jump and then what I did 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.299
 was to investigate read a lot I went to a 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.329
 store I study explaining the amount 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.069
 of care they need and I realized 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 that did not have the time 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.509
 enough to give him a life 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.459
 happy to that animal that I do not say a 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.810
 good life and I say a happy life that 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.090
 I think that 's what we all deserve 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 then accept that I do not have either 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 time that these animals need for 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.429
 very monkeys that are and for many desire 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.069
 I have so I have made the decision 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.630
 more logical I will not buy any 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.909
 pet that I think he had 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.799
 enough with my brother as a pet 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.329
 for many years and the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.090
 moment when I can get hold of a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.079
 little Dalmatian and take care of him but now 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.079
 it's that moment 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.130
 and I think it's a reflection that all 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.260
 people have to buy one 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.430
 pet should do because finally 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.500
 and after all, it's a very important decision 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.360
 that can not be taken lightly is not 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.680
 a whim and you have some 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.630
 pet which is loving we do the thing 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.850
 let me follow my fingers palin just 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.650
 under the bed, leave it to me and tell me 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.450
 because I'd love to know what kind of 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.760
 animals you have and especially how 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.000
 you take care how you make these animals 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.970
 be happy at home you take it out a lot 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.300
 you get little if I'm happy with little me 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.890
 I do not ask too much, I'll have to talk to 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.050
 the galactic constellation so that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 they sent sticks and have it at home 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.780
 climbing on all mothers 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.160
 you just saw yourself wounded 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.730
 day by day you can comment give me 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.609
