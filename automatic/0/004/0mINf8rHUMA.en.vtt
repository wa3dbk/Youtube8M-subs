 Edition and good black box worth horrible 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.789
 the truth is that it is a bit but not like that 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.199
 there are fixed points of no point then 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.989
 it's wrong because they said the points and 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.710
 they will continue to be this 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 beginning of april 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 Well, here we have the cartouche 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.820
 which is just like us 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 that this one does not work in 3ds 3ds xl and two 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.750
 bets to see how many people fall 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.549

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.369

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.399

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.429

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.979

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.520
 points that I have left but if 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.799

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.360

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.789
 points me with people who say goodbye 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.259
 it's worth nothing since you know that we 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.489

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.049
