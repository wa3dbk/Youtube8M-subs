hard to get these songs right in in
their<00:02:00.950> original<00:02:01.220> language<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.600> now<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.870> just

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
their original language so now to just

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.950 
their original language so now to just
take<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.650> convert<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.760> simlish<00:02:05.240> it

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
take that and convert it to simlish it

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960 
take that and convert it to simlish it
puts<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.380> lot<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.590> work<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.010> on<00:02:07.280> them<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:07.790> it's

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
puts a lot of work on on them so it's

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.820 
puts a lot of work on on them so it's
perfect<00:02:08.360> for<00:02:08.390> me<00:02:08.600> because<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.900> things<00:02:09.260> is<00:02:09.500> early

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
they're singing a different language

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.640 
they're singing a different language
