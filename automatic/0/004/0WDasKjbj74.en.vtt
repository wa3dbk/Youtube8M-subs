00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
just because the game place completely

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.800 
just because the game place completely
different<00:06:15.250> it's<00:06:15.460> a<00:06:15.670> lot<00:06:15.820> more<00:06:15.850> slow<00:06:16.240> down<00:06:16.540> it's

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
different it's a lot more slow down it's

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.300 
different it's a lot more slow down it's
gonna<00:06:16.960> be<00:06:17.170> a<00:06:17.200> lot<00:06:17.410> more<00:06:17.470> suited<00:06:17.980> for<00:06:18.010> me<00:06:18.280> I

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
reckon I just can't wait for the game to

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.810 
reckon I just can't wait for the game to
come<00:06:20.380> out<00:06:20.560> so<00:06:20.950> you<00:06:21.040> can<00:06:21.160> see<00:06:21.310> what<00:06:21.430> I<00:06:21.490> mean<00:06:21.670> I
