another video for the Hmong survivalist
and<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.480> case<00:00:09.780> showing<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.110> guys<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.889> kind

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and in this case showing you guys I kind

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.100 
and in this case showing you guys I kind
of<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> haven't<00:00:12.360> shown<00:00:12.929> before

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
of like that I haven't shown before

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.740 
of like that I haven't shown before
usually<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.030> smaller<00:00:15.389> or

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
usually I do like you know smaller or

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.800 
usually I do like you know smaller or
even<00:00:16.049> bigger<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.529> know<00:00:16.619> LED<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.119> flashlight

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
even bigger you know LED the flashlight

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.640 
even bigger you know LED the flashlight
CDC<00:00:19.350> lights<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:21.230> headlamps<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.439> sort<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
CDC lights or headlamps and that sort of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.970 
CDC lights or headlamps and that sort of
thing

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
thing

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.849 
thing
now<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.300> lantern<00:00:24.750> definitely<00:00:25.380> does<00:00:25.650> have

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
now the the lantern definitely does have

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.990 
now the the lantern definitely does have
a<00:00:25.920> place<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.599> it's<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.410> first<00:00:29.000> fluorescent

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
a place but it's the first fluorescent

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.190 
a place but it's the first fluorescent
tube<00:00:30.390> lantern<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.830> I've<00:00:31.980> actually<00:00:32.160> shown

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
tube lantern that I've actually shown

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.910 
tube lantern that I've actually shown
and<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.430> definitely<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.750> option<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.770> it's

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and it is definitely an option and it's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
and it is definitely an option and it's
definitely<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> good<00:00:38.969> option<00:00:39.180> even<00:00:39.690> especially

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
definitely a good option even especially

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
definitely a good option even especially
for<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.680> kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> light<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
for this kind of light for a for a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.610 
for this kind of light for a for a
lantern<00:00:43.640> maybe<00:00:44.640> not<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> well-known<00:00:45.960> fact<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
lantern maybe not a well-known fact is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.729 
lantern maybe not a well-known fact is
that<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.030> today<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.020> fluorescent

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that the as of today the fluorescent

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
that the as of today the fluorescent
tube<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.760> efficient<00:00:51.360> than

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
tube is actually more efficient than

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.970 
tube is actually more efficient than
LEDs<00:00:52.770> yes<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.789> true<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.989> theoretically

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
LEDs yes it's true that in theoretically

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.689 
LEDs yes it's true that in theoretically
speaking<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.270> last<00:00:57.989> year<00:00:58.699> there's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
speaking you know last year there's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.209 
speaking you know last year there's
already<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.570> developments<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.410> LED<00:01:01.739> being

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
already been developments on LED being

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
already been developments on LED being
even<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.750> efficient<00:01:03.750> than<00:01:04.339> fluorescent

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
even more efficient than fluorescent

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.880 
even more efficient than fluorescent
tubes<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> have

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
tubes but as of right now what you have

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.700 
tubes but as of right now what you have
in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> market<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.990> tube<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
in the market is the tube the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
in the market is the tube the
fluorescent<00:01:11.189> tube<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.520> more<00:01:11.700> efficient

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
fluorescent tube it is more efficient

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
fluorescent tube it is more efficient
I'll<00:01:12.450> give<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> an<00:01:12.750> example<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I'll give you an example of that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.780 
I'll give you an example of that
actually<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:14.119> Phoenix<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.920> uses<00:01:17.400> two

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
actually a Phoenix that uses two

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.359 
actually a Phoenix that uses two
double-a<00:01:18.330> batteries<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:20.040> gonna<00:01:20.159> be

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
double-a batteries it's gonna be

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
double-a batteries it's gonna be
providing<00:01:20.970> 200<00:01:21.600> lumens<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.290> two<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> half

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
providing 200 lumens for two and a half

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
providing 200 lumens for two and a half
hours<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.700> right

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
hours all right

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
hours all right
this<00:01:24.540> main<00:01:25.350> lantern<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> other<00:01:26.250> hand<00:01:27.110> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this main lantern on the other hand and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.039 
this main lantern on the other hand and
it<00:01:28.229> uses<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.590> three<00:01:29.340> watts

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
it uses a three watts

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
it uses a three watts
they<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.259> information<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:32.509> check

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
they have information there check

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
they have information there check
changing<00:01:34.079> modes<00:01:36.170> uses<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> four<00:01:37.920> double<00:01:38.520> A

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
changing modes uses a four double A

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.990 
changing modes uses a four double A
batteries<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.979> it's<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> 3<00:01:41.490> watt<00:01:41.759> fluorescent

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
batteries and it's a 3 watt fluorescent

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.039 
batteries and it's a 3 watt fluorescent
tube<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.020> about<00:01:43.530> 300<00:01:44.430> lumens<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.329> it's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
tube so it's about 300 lumens and it's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.710 
tube so it's about 300 lumens and it's
gonna<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.380> lasting<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:46.979> burn<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.240> five

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
gonna be lasting for burn time five

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
gonna be lasting for burn time five
hours<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.820> 4<00:01:51.450> 4<00:01:52.200> 4<00:01:52.649> double<00:01:53.579> A

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
hours all right so 4 4 4 double A

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
hours all right so 4 4 4 double A
batteries<00:01:53.780> it's<00:01:54.780> gonna<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.170> lasting<00:01:55.680> five

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
batteries it's gonna be lasting five

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.020 
batteries it's gonna be lasting five
hours<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.630> 300<00:01:57.630> lumens<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.140> course<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
hours of 300 lumens of course this is a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
hours of 300 lumens of course this is a
flawed<00:02:00.030> type<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.689> light<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.110> focus<00:02:01.740> as

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
flawed type of light it's not focus as

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.280 
flawed type of light it's not focus as
an<00:02:01.979> LED<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.880> compared<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.479> Phoenix<00:02:04.020> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
an LED but compared to a Phoenix that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.649 
an LED but compared to a Phoenix that
uses<00:02:04.649> two<00:02:04.890> double-a<00:02:05.280> batteries<00:02:05.909> last<00:02:06.450> says

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
uses two double-a batteries last says

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.499 
uses two double-a batteries last says
for<00:02:06.990> two<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> half<00:02:07.799> hours<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.399> 200<00:02:09.149> lumens

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
for two and a half hours of 200 lumens

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.930 
for two and a half hours of 200 lumens
it's<00:02:09.810> clearly<00:02:10.140> more<00:02:10.590> efficient<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's clearly more efficient the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
it's clearly more efficient the
downsize<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.530> course

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
downsize is that this is of course

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760 
downsize is that this is of course
nowhere<00:02:14.400> near<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.970> long-lasting<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.590> as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
nowhere near as long-lasting and as

tubes have you know a little bit more of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.710 
tubes have you know a little bit more of
our<00:02:22.710> complex<00:02:23.310> mechanism<00:02:23.970> going<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.420> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
our complex mechanism going on it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.500 
our complex mechanism going on it
actually<00:02:25.170> explains<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.890> whenever<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.210> turn

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
actually explains that whenever you turn

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.920 
actually explains that whenever you turn
it<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.840> off<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:29.090> know<00:02:30.090> here<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.660> you

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
it on and off you know here you have you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.870 
it on and off you know here you have you
know<00:02:31.020> important<00:02:31.830> information<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.430> make<00:02:32.610> the

fluorescent bulb last longer allow
twenty<00:02:35.160> seconds<00:02:35.580> between<00:02:35.780> turning<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.960> and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
twenty seconds between turning on and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.190 
twenty seconds between turning on and
off<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:38.430> turn<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.210> off<00:02:39.300> repeatedly

off do not turn on and off repeatedly

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.280 
off do not turn on and off repeatedly
remove<00:02:41.160> these<00:02:41.850> batteries<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.170> be

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
remove these batteries so you have to be

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
remove these batteries so you have to be
careful<00:02:43.650> about<00:02:43.800> leaving<00:02:44.130> twenty<00:02:44.550> seconds<00:02:44.910> in

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
careful about leaving twenty seconds in

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.330 
careful about leaving twenty seconds in
between<00:02:45.300> turning<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.650> off<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:47.190> is

between turning it on on and off it is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.310 
between turning it on on and off it is
more<00:02:47.610> delicate<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.390> definitely<00:02:48.960> not

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
more delicate and it's definitely not

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.430 
more delicate and it's definitely not
going<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.100> be<00:02:50.310> lasting<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.330> long<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:52.350> not

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
going to be lasting that long it's not

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.160

going to be lasting as long as as LEDs

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.480 
going to be lasting as long as as LEDs
but<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.610> kind<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:58.230> know

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
but for this kind of thing for you know

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.980 
but for this kind of thing for you know
even<00:02:59.490> though<00:02:59.700> I've<00:02:59.820> said<00:03:00.120> before<00:03:00.360> many<00:03:00.660> times

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
even though I've said before many times

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.930 
even though I've said before many times
at<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> headlamp<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:02.160> more<00:03:02.400> useful<00:03:02.580> because

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
at a headlamp it's more useful because

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.270 
at a headlamp it's more useful because
it<00:03:03.150> allows<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.570> focus<00:03:03.900> love<00:03:04.800> light

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
it allows you to focus love light

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.460 
it allows you to focus love light
specifically<00:03:06.270> where<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.750> need<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.260> gets

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
specifically where you need it and gets

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.250 
specifically where you need it and gets
in<00:03:07.800> jobs<00:03:08.490> done<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:09.240> during<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.630> blackout<00:03:09.810> when

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
in jobs done when during a blackout when

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.410 
in jobs done when during a blackout when
you<00:03:10.350> don't<00:03:10.740> have<00:03:10.860> power<00:03:11.220> sometimes<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.390> just

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
you don't have power sometimes you just

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.590 
you don't have power sometimes you just
want<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.870> illuminate<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.770> room<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:15.030> know<00:03:15.150> just

just want to put light in a room and for

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.460 
just want to put light in a room and for
that<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> lantern<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.190> ideal<00:03:27.240> some<00:03:27.690> people<00:03:28.110> like

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that a lantern is ideal some people like

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.580 
that a lantern is ideal some people like
lanterns<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.130> use<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.990> natural<00:03:30.990> gas<00:03:31.170> source

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
lanterns that use a natural gas source

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.010 
lanterns that use a natural gas source
or<00:03:31.830> compressed<00:03:32.550> gas<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.880> some<00:03:33.030> sort<00:03:33.330> or<00:03:33.540> or

or compressed gas of some sort or or
liquid<00:03:34.560> fuel<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:35.100> think<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.300> a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
liquid fuel I think that a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.500 
liquid fuel I think that a
battery-operated<00:03:38.000> lantern<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
battery-operated lantern it's it's a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.560 
battery-operated lantern it's it's a
much<00:03:39.660> safer<00:03:39.959> cleaner<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:42.060> hassle-free

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
much safer cleaner and in hassle-free

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.960 
much safer cleaner and in hassle-free
your<00:03:43.380> choice<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.220> know<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.370> think<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
your choice you know I think it's a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.479 
your choice you know I think it's a
pretty<00:03:45.209> good<00:03:45.330> alternative<00:03:45.420> this<00:03:46.170> one<00:03:46.489> it's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
pretty good alternative this one it's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.860 
pretty good alternative this one it's
actually<00:03:47.670> pretty<00:03:48.180> well<00:03:48.330> constructed<00:03:49.080> pretty

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
actually pretty well constructed pretty

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.400 
actually pretty well constructed pretty
pretty<00:03:51.870> solidly<00:03:52.380> built<00:03:53.130> waterproofed<00:03:53.970> to
