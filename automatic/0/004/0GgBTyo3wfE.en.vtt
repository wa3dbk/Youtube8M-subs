be used to make silk cloth we could swap
into<00:02:53.870> gold<00:02:54.380> another<00:02:54.790> then<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.870> be

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
into gold another then that can be

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.180 
into gold another then that can be
turned<00:02:57.200> into<00:02:57.380> an<00:02:57.890> ingot<00:02:58.220> quite<00:02:58.459> obvious<00:02:58.700> like
