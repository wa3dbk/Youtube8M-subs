ceiling pulls even is this high and then

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.690 
ceiling pulls even is this high and then
we<00:02:00.909> ship<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.509> down<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:05.049> have<00:02:05.530> something<00:02:06.130> like

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
we ship it down and have something like

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:19.979 
we ship it down and have something like
this<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:18.280> course<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.209> take<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> photo<00:02:19.690> of

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
this of course you can take a photo of

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.110 
this of course you can take a photo of
everything<00:02:20.590> distort<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.580> use<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
everything distort and then use a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.490 
everything distort and then use a
Photoshop<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.579> couette<00:02:24.579> in<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.630> collect

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
Photoshop to couette in if you collect

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500 
Photoshop to couette in if you collect
the<00:02:26.590> distortion<00:02:27.099> we<00:02:27.250> lost<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.610> lot<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.910> pixel

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the distortion we lost a lot of pixel

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.979 
the distortion we lost a lot of pixel
then<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.470> result<00:02:29.829> photos<00:02:30.459> maybe<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:31.000> big

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
then the result photos maybe not big

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.610 
then the result photos maybe not big
enough<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.489> secondly<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:34.180> lost<00:02:34.390> time<00:02:34.620> which

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
enough and secondly it lost time which

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.150 
enough and secondly it lost time which
if<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.790> are<00:02:36.880> doing<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.269> job<00:02:37.840> app<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.500> job<00:02:38.860> that

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
losing time is with the money so stop

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.890 
losing time is with the money so stop
saying<00:02:42.579> that<00:02:42.819> well<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.209> could<00:02:43.269> just<00:02:43.450> Photoshop

relatively<00:02:53.769> simple<00:02:54.160> I've<00:02:54.420> won<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:57.130> framing

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
relatively simple I've won this framing

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.420 
relatively simple I've won this framing
which<00:02:58.450> are<00:02:58.630> like<00:02:58.810> those<00:02:59.380> chair<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.889> a<00:02:59.920> bit<00:03:00.190> talk

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
which are like those chair is a bit talk

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.900 
which are like those chair is a bit talk
its<00:03:00.790> merged<00:03:01.630> together<00:03:02.410> with<00:03:02.889> their<00:03:03.100> shitty<00:03:03.430> PC

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
its merged together with their shitty PC

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.550 
its merged together with their shitty PC
so<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:05.440> going<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.859> add<00:03:06.100> one<00:03:06.910> speed<00:03:07.329> light<00:03:07.600> so

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
so I'm going to add one speed light so

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.840 
so I'm going to add one speed light so
this<00:03:09.069> distance<00:03:10.030> AB<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.569> short<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.260> more<00:03:11.500> thing

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
this distance AB is short so more thing

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.990 
this distance AB is short so more thing
I'll<00:03:12.850> ever<00:03:12.910> use<00:03:13.329> quite<00:03:13.900> low<00:03:14.730> power<00:03:15.730> setting

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
I'll ever use quite low power setting

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.410 
I'll ever use quite low power setting
