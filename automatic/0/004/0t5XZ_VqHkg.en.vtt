series that are nice to have on as a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.420 
series that are nice to have on as a
background<00:00:23.640> series<00:00:24.119> cuz<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.480> better

background series cuz they get better

background series cuz they get better
this<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> real<00:00:27.000> good<00:00:27.180> example<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this was a real good example of this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.840 
this was a real good example of this
it's<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> lot<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:30.170> competitiveness<00:00:31.489> but<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it's got a lot of competitiveness but it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's got a lot of competitiveness but it
also<00:00:33.090> adds<00:00:34.460> really<00:00:35.460> strange<00:00:36.440> characters<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
also adds really strange characters and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.030 
also adds really strange characters and
plots<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.420> gets<00:00:39.780> complicated<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.770> pretty

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
plots and gets complicated and pretty

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
plots and gets complicated and pretty
good<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.300> able<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.629> last

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.310 
good you kind of have to be able to last
long<00:00:43.770> enough<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.899> having<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
long enough and having it on this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
long enough and having it on this
something<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> background<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:48.000> helps

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
something in the background really helps

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
something in the background really helps
to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.530> real<00:00:58.710> funny<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.250> they

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
to do that it's real funny to have they

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.560 
to do that it's real funny to have they
had<00:00:59.520> actual<00:01:00.030> transformers<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> too<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:02.570> mean

this<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> fairly<00:01:28.650> enjoyable<00:01:29.070> series<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
this was a fairly enjoyable series I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
this was a fairly enjoyable series I
think<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:34.040> mean<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.390> can't<00:01:36.390> help<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
think I mean I can't help but think that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.490 
think I mean I can't help but think that
they<00:01:37.250> didn't<00:01:38.250> execute<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.030> perfectly<00:01:39.500> what

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
they didn't execute it perfectly what

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.560 
they didn't execute it perfectly what
they<00:01:40.590> were<00:01:40.650> trying<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.479> or<00:01:44.060> well<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> thought

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
they were trying to do or well I thought

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.060 
they were trying to do or well I thought
it<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:45.990> enough<00:01:47.540> hmm<00:01:48.540> let's<00:01:49.049> see

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.570 

next<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.460> got<00:01:53.750> Slayers<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.560> let's<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.400> we

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
next up we got Slayers so let's see we

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.180 
next up we got Slayers so let's see we
got<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.869> funimation<00:01:58.140> first<00:01:58.650> season<00:01:59.040> I

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
got here the funimation first season I

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.300 
got here the funimation first season I
used<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.850> previous<00:02:01.010> older<00:02:02.010> first

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
used to have the previous older first

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.020 
used to have the previous older first
season<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.619> think<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.680> gave<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:04.920> away<00:02:05.159> just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
season I think I gave that away just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.090 
season I think I gave that away just
because<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.270> wanted<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> first<00:02:06.869> season<00:02:07.100> but

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
because I wanted the first season but

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.500 
because I wanted the first season but
this<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> wanted<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.850> rebuy<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.930 

so<00:02:15.510> things<00:02:15.900> were<00:02:16.080> more<00:02:16.230> consistent<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.920> guess

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.990 

plays<00:02:20.940> pretty<00:02:21.480> good<00:02:21.690> series<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.850> have<00:02:23.850> been

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
plays pretty good series I have been

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.270 
plays pretty good series I have been
enjoying<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:25.230> watch<00:02:25.470> many<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.190> these

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
enjoying it I can watch many of these

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.410 
enjoying it I can watch many of these
movies<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:31.850> really<00:02:32.850> ought<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:35.420> that's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
movies so I really ought to and that's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
movies so I really ought to and that's
the<00:02:36.780> end<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.989> all<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.530> slave<00:02:37.739> stuff<00:02:37.950> i<00:02:38.070> have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the end of all the slave stuff i have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.830 
the end of all the slave stuff i have
here<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.610> i<00:02:38.670> think<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.540> worth<00:02:39.630> mentioning

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
here but i think it's worth mentioning

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.020 
here but i think it's worth mentioning
that<00:02:40.140> over<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.620> there's<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.040> another<00:02:41.580> slayer

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that over there there's a another slayer

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.750 
that over there there's a another slayer
