00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
so impact sensitivity and I can just get

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.399 
so impact sensitivity and I can just get
on<00:05:09.370> with<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.610> game<00:05:09.639> and<00:05:10.000> start<00:05:10.780> playing<00:05:10.870> okay

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
guys so we're going to be using pilot

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.760 
guys so we're going to be using pilot
wings<00:05:12.880> 64<00:05:13.000> which<00:05:13.780> is<00:05:13.930> one<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.110> my<00:05:14.259> favourite

games the system and I think we'll be

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.100 
games the system and I think we'll be
using<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.789> gyro<00:05:19.060> copter<00:05:19.360> because<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:19.990> one

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
using the gyro copter because it's one

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.290 
using the gyro copter because it's one

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.350 
here we go and this is what the tilt
pack<00:05:35.830> is<00:05:36.190> all<00:05:36.820> about<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:39.070> as<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.370> can<00:05:39.460> see<00:05:39.520> if<00:05:40.240> I

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
pack is all about so as you can see if I

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.300 
pack is all about so as you can see if I
tilt<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:40.960> left<00:05:41.050> tilt<00:05:41.740> it<00:05:41.889> to<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.039> right

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
tilt to the left tilt it to the right

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.659 
tilt to the left tilt it to the right
the<00:05:42.550> gyro<00:05:42.759> copter<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.270> doing<00:05:43.740> exactly<00:05:44.740> what<00:05:45.159> I

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
the gyro copter is doing exactly what I

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.640 
the gyro copter is doing exactly what I
tell<00:05:45.970> it<00:05:46.120> it's<00:05:46.719> a<00:05:46.750> bit<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.080> using<00:05:47.409> the<00:05:47.469> Wii

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
tell it it's a bit like using the Wii

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.170 
tell it it's a bit like using the Wii
Remote<00:05:47.979> when<00:05:48.159> you're<00:05:48.280> playing<00:05:48.490> Mario<00:05:49.090> Kart

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
Remote when you're playing Mario Kart

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.600 
Remote when you're playing Mario Kart
Wii<00:05:49.750> or<00:05:50.620> something<00:05:51.039> like<00:05:51.130> that

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
Wii or something like that

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.749 
Wii or something like that
and<00:05:51.909> it<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.240> actually<00:05:52.570> so<00:05:53.289> simple<00:05:54.039> to<00:05:54.190> use<00:05:54.400> and

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
and it is actually so simple to use and

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.020 
and it is actually so simple to use and
so<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:55.539> having<00:05:55.870> to<00:05:55.930> use<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.699> analog<00:05:57.699> stick

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
so you having to use the analog stick

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.240 
so you having to use the analog stick
and<00:05:59.490> I<00:06:00.490> just<00:06:00.759> think<00:06:00.940> it's<00:06:01.090> a<00:06:01.150> really<00:06:01.630> marvelous

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
and I just think it's a really marvelous

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:10.740 
and I just think it's a really marvelous
thing<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.490> there's<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.810> there<00:06:04.990> then

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.460 

to<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.840> right<00:06:12.020> bit<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:16.280> there<00:06:16.460> you<00:06:16.550> have<00:06:16.610> it

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
to the right bit and there you have it

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.920 
to the right bit and there you have it
but<00:06:18.470> still<00:06:18.680> packing<00:06:19.220> in<00:06:19.460> motion<00:06:20.120> okay<00:06:20.870> so

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
but still packing in motion okay so

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.809 
but still packing in motion okay so
perhaps<00:06:21.229> this<00:06:21.500> device<00:06:21.830> is<00:06:22.099> not<00:06:22.310> for<00:06:22.550> everyone

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
perhaps this device is not for everyone

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.640 
perhaps this device is not for everyone
but<00:06:22.970> if<00:06:23.270> you<00:06:23.360> are<00:06:23.630> looking<00:06:23.870> for<00:06:24.199> something<00:06:24.380> to

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
but if you are looking for something to

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.490 
but if you are looking for something to
spruce<00:06:25.099> up<00:06:25.280> those<00:06:25.490> classics<00:06:26.060> or<00:06:26.210> Nintendo<00:06:26.539> 64

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
spruce up those classics or Nintendo 64

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.249 
spruce up those classics or Nintendo 64
and<00:06:27.710> this<00:06:28.160> definitely<00:06:28.639> could<00:06:29.180> be<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.569> after<00:06:29.960> 20

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
and this definitely could be it after 20

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.230 
and this definitely could be it after 20
pounds<00:06:30.620> which<00:06:30.800> is<00:06:30.949> what<00:06:31.130> I<00:06:31.160> paid<00:06:31.550> for<00:06:31.580> it<00:06:31.819> and<00:06:32.060> I

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
pounds which is what I paid for it and I

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.909 
pounds which is what I paid for it and I
know<00:06:32.300> you<00:06:32.479> can<00:06:32.750> pick<00:06:32.930> them<00:06:33.080> up<00:06:33.169> in<00:06:33.319> America<00:06:33.740> for

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
know you can pick them up in America for

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.279 
know you can pick them up in America for
less<00:06:34.009> than<00:06:34.190> $10<00:06:34.789> I<00:06:34.940> think<00:06:35.360> it<00:06:35.479> is<00:06:35.660> worth<00:06:35.900> every

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
less than $10 I think it is worth every

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.150 
less than $10 I think it is worth every
penny

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
penny

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.370 
penny

okay bar a few downsides such as you

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.409

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
seems to work straight away and

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.570 
seems to work straight away and
