00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.010
 and louis welcome to school europe 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 today I will introduce you to 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.110
 study legs that I like that I 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.900
 nicknamed the universe of pop from a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 simple chord progression 1 4 5 6 on 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 will play open body 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.650
 barry guard slope to tanner who was sending 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.920
 add the hood all on one 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.920
 progression in damage an agreement 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 we 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.770
 we 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.770
 in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.770
 Oh 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.150
 an agreement would have 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.170
 matamec top 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 at 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 we do not have 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.520
 we 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 no 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.119
 no 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.509
 good 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.509
 good 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.480
 now we go back to the beginning for 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.680
 explanations of this study progression 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:06.370
 in C major with both grids 1 4 5 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:12.119
 6 on a cha cha rhythm the time a 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.119
 level of rhythm to note going on here 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.800
 then waited in paris then we 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.800
 really 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.310
 after 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.829
 this is for the rhythmic progression in 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.969
 pity to start here on the agreement to 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.969
 major gift with degree 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.290
 grey 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.190
 then the chords will laugh at the beginning 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:18.270
 always agree to do major here in 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:20.220
 bar and they put us end sooner or if 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:27.090
 major so we get a barred chord 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:31.020
 in C major of grid of the mill here 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.210
 degree 6 and 9 are facing the always 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:45.360
 on the 6th strings fifth cause the 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:48.270
 note the most minor position then 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:55.200
 the F major agreement ended the six 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:58.610
 major well 15 4th degree here is the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.610
 third box for the rope 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.920
 then the pentatonic scale in C 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.920
 major I will play 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.590
 and 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.379
 he is from gruissan 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.090
 Oh 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.949
 a whole range of 5.9 different very 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.289
 useful for improvisation 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.729
 we played in C major because the 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.380
 progression was in C major on 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.810
 could transpose it in all 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.669
 dark tones and comes and we can 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.669
 here he added an extension 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.600
 but allows us to go back 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:13.210
 homo 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:17.740
 and yet led the hood kas 3 in the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.430
 major that is actually had to be a 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.430
 damage to 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:54.540
 the reality and when showing the hood 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.370
 here again 5 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.990
 they will play in G major tonality 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.770
 it's like playing in C 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.770
 major also 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:40.379
 the major rope of damage to any 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.099
 the progression we've played since 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:46.590
 a few minutes 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:48.659
 he has the tone of damage that's all 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.240
 for this comic on learn to 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:53.009
 transpose these progressions into all 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.380
 tones I'll give you 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:57.300
 backing jacques the scores his site 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.090
 triple double v point school 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.900
 durable.com on it best practices 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.349
 and have a good week 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.349
 bye
