beta<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> speak<00:01:12.380> very<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.740> interested<00:01:14.189> to

see<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.880> pans<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:18.020> I'm<00:01:19.020> guessing<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
see how this all pans out I'm guessing I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
see how this all pans out I'm guessing I
might<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> slight<00:01:20.729> advantage<00:01:21.590> just

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
might have a slight advantage just

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
might have a slight advantage just
because<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.950> did<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.520> quite<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> time

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because I did have quite a bit of time

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
because I did have quite a bit of time
in<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.009> Alpha<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.340> who<00:01:29.549> knows<00:01:29.579> how

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
in the Alpha but you know who knows how

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.950 
in the Alpha but you know who knows how
long<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.509> people<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.900> been

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.680 
frustrated during the Alpha because of
the<00:02:34.660> hit<00:02:34.780> notification<00:02:35.470> wasn't<00:02:36.390> quite<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
the hit notification wasn't quite the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.530 
the hit notification wasn't quite the
way<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.840> should<00:02:37.989> have<00:02:38.230> been<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:40.330> was<00:02:40.510> a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
way it should have been that was a

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
way it should have been that was a
little<00:02:40.750> quick<00:02:41.019> right<00:02:41.230> there<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.310> first

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
little quick right there but that first

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.840 
little quick right there but that first
death<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.120> suffered<00:02:43.540> felt<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.980> had<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.550> fair

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
death I suffered felt like I had a fair

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.470 
death I suffered felt like I had a fair
chance<00:02:47.549> but<00:02:48.549> yeah<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> second<00:02:49.360> base

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
chance but yeah this is the second base

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.410 
chance but yeah this is the second base
this<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.590> always<00:02:51.070> or<00:02:51.760> at<00:02:51.880> least<00:02:52.090> during<00:02:52.269> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
this is always or at least during the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.620 
this is always or at least during the
Alpha<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.959> was<00:02:53.110> always<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.890> most<00:02:54.100> difficult

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
Alpha it was always the most difficult

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.000 
Alpha it was always the most difficult
base<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.840> take<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:59.530> because<00:02:59.739> there<00:02:59.920> are<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
base to take just because there are a

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.340 
base to take just because there are a
lot<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.250> chokepoints<00:03:03.780> shit<00:03:06.930> yeah<00:03:07.930> nothing's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
lot of chokepoints shit yeah nothing's

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.289 
lot of chokepoints shit yeah nothing's
set<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> toggle<00:03:09.220> right<00:03:09.459> now<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.209> going

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
set to toggle right now so this is going

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.140 
set to toggle right now so this is going
to<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.450> tough<00:03:10.660> because<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.440> am<00:03:12.040> used<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.489> toggle

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
to be tough because I am used to toggle

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.860 
to be tough because I am used to toggle
controls<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:14.049> I'll<00:03:15.010> manage<00:03:15.310> I'll<00:03:15.880> manage<00:03:16.180> no

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
controls but I'll manage I'll manage no

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.630 
controls but I'll manage I'll manage no
big<00:03:17.049> deal<00:03:17.700> i'm<00:03:18.700> using<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.299> assault<00:03:20.170> kit<00:03:20.640> which

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
big deal i'm using the assault kit which

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.479 
big deal i'm using the assault kit which
is<00:03:22.390> more<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> medic<00:03:23.860> kit<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.190> don't<00:03:24.370> really

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
is more like a medic kit I don't really

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.860 
is more like a medic kit I don't really
know<00:03:24.730> why<00:03:24.940> they're<00:03:25.120> calling<00:03:25.359> it<00:03:25.510> assault

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
know why they're calling it assault

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.509 
know why they're calling it assault
other<00:03:26.109> than<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.410> fact<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.010> designed

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
other than the fact that it is designed

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.699 
other than the fact that it is designed
to<00:03:27.790> be<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:27.970> kind<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> frontline<00:03:29.200> soldier

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
to be the kind of the frontline soldier

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.370 
to be the kind of the frontline soldier
but<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:31.000> do<00:03:31.120> have<00:03:31.269> medic<00:03:31.540> capabilities<00:03:32.140> and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
but you do have medic capabilities and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.319 
but you do have medic capabilities and
i'm<00:03:33.130> using<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.459> AK<00:03:33.760> 74<00:03:34.180> m<00:03:34.510> which<00:03:36.209> during<00:03:37.209> my

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
i'm using the AK 74 m which during my

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.360 
i'm using the AK 74 m which during my
time<00:03:37.510> with<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.200> alpha<00:03:38.560> was<00:03:38.769> was<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.130> very

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
time with the alpha was was a very

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.479 
time with the alpha was was a very
useful<00:03:39.609> weapon<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.150> very<00:03:40.390> good<00:03:40.630> weapon
