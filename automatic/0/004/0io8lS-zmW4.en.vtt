and I don't use their hiking socks from

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.770 
and I don't use their hiking socks from
darn<00:06:14.310> tough<00:06:14.550> because<00:06:14.849> they're<00:06:15.180> thicker<00:06:15.479> with

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
darn tough because they're thicker with

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.350 
darn tough because they're thicker with
more<00:06:15.990> padding<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.560> find<00:06:17.099> I<00:06:17.250> get<00:06:17.310> less<00:06:17.699> blisters

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
more padding I find I get less blisters

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.390 
more padding I find I get less blisters
and<00:06:18.570> less<00:06:18.720> problems<00:06:19.410> with<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:20.039> socks<00:06:20.280> that

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
and less problems with the socks that

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.310 
and less problems with the socks that
are<00:06:20.639> designed<00:06:20.970> for<00:06:21.060> running<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.690> biking<00:06:21.810> and

are designed for running and biking and

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.740 
are designed for running and biking and
they're<00:06:22.889> lighter<00:06:23.070> weight<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:23.760> because

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
they're lighter weight and because

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.070 
they're lighter weight and because
they're<00:06:24.900> thinner<00:06:25.139> they<00:06:25.410> dry<00:06:25.770> quicker<00:06:26.990> okay<00:06:30.080> so

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
they're thinner they dry quicker okay so
