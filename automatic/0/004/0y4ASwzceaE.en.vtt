00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
yeah this is the stadium glitch I'm

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.839 
yeah this is the stadium glitch I'm
playing<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.590> these<00:02:37.590> seasons<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.519> Red

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
playing this these seasons with Red

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.500 
playing this these seasons with Red
Bulls<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.300> sport<00:02:39.690> from<00:02:40.940> Austria<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.030> believe<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
Bulls a sport from Austria I believe it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.910 
Bulls a sport from Austria I believe it
is<00:02:42.630> because<00:02:43.519> they<00:02:44.519> only<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:45.060> ten<00:02:45.560> ten<00:02:46.560> teams

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
is because they only have ten ten teams

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
is because they only have ten ten teams
in<00:02:47.250> their<00:02:47.430> league<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.390> simulate

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
in their league so I can simulate

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.780 
in their league so I can simulate
through<00:02:49.140> those<00:02:49.350> seasons<00:02:49.920> pretty<00:02:50.459> fast

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
through those seasons pretty fast

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.100 
through those seasons pretty fast
compared<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> some<00:02:52.380> other<00:02:53.390> leagues<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.720> clubs

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
compared to some other leagues and clubs

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.990 
compared to some other leagues and clubs
so<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.519> could<00:02:56.700> see<00:02:56.880> another

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
so right here you could see another

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.479 
so right here you could see another
outside<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.500> foot<00:02:58.739> shot<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.280> him

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
outside of it of the foot shot with him

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.020
