00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 3 or 4 red tomatoes together 4 leaves 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.030

 three tablespoons of salt oil to taste and 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.140

 powder and a teaspoon of salt you have to 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.020
 be careful with the salt because the 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:01.090
 meat was animated with salt 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 to this 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.460

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.510
 meat is soft 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.290

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.810
 add the potato 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:51.030

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.390
 again to the casserole 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.370

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.129
 depending on whether we want it to be more or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.819
