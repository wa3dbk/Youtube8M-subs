how many walls they penetrate here's the
shells<00:00:41.670> room<00:00:41.820> using<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.360> some<00:00:42.480> number

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
shells room using this as some number

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
shells room using this as some number
eight<00:00:42.840> birdshot<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.170> next<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.210> some

bird<00:01:03.329> shot<00:01:03.539> first<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.019> coming<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
bird shot first this coming out of a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:17.710 
bird shot first this coming out of a
Mossberg<00:01:04.769> 930<00:01:05.460> JM<00:01:05.850> pro<00:01:06.000> tactical

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.480 

let's<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.840> check<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> damaged<00:01:22.760> wall<00:01:23.760> one

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
let's go check out the damaged wall one

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.350 
let's go check out the damaged wall one
successfully<00:01:26.490> pass<00:01:26.670> through<00:01:27.030> wall<00:01:27.780> two

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
successfully pass through wall two

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.060 
successfully pass through wall two
completely<00:01:30.360> pass<00:01:30.600> through<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.440> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
completely pass through as well and it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.670 
completely pass through as well and it
looks<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.420> stopped<00:01:33.899> right<00:01:34.170> here

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
looks like it just stopped right here

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.950 
looks like it just stopped right here
that's<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:35.399> dust<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.909> wall<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that's all dust from wall to so this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740 
that's all dust from wall to so this
wall<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.350> still<00:01:37.500> completely<00:01:37.830> intact<00:01:38.630> just<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
wall is still completely intact just a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.980 
wall is still completely intact just a
couple<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.140> dents<00:01:40.590> from<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> bb's<00:01:41.130> here

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
couple little dents from the bb's here

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.889 
couple little dents from the bb's here
so<00:01:42.990> basically<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.830> your<00:01:44.369> kid<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.820> behind<00:01:45.119> two

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
so basically if your kid was behind two

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
so basically if your kid was behind two
walls<00:01:46.280> they<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.580> got<00:01:47.700> peppered

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
walls they would have got peppered

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450 
walls they would have got peppered
pretty<00:01:48.300> hard<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.810> probably<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.800> fatally

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
pretty hard but probably not fatally

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.859 
pretty hard but probably not fatally
all<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.090> birdshot<00:01:51.450> went<00:01:51.660> through

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
all right so that birdshot went through

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
all right so that birdshot went through
two<00:01:52.140> walls<00:01:52.440> I<00:01:52.800> have<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> feeling<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.880> number

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
two walls I have a feeling this number

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:05.850 
two walls I have a feeling this number
four<00:01:54.270> bucks<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.660> go<00:01:54.750> through<00:01:54.899> everything

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:15.480 

let's<00:02:06.860> go<00:02:06.950> find<00:02:07.190> out<00:02:12.880> first<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.000> all<00:02:14.090> dead

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
let's go find out first of all dead

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.850 
let's go find out first of all dead
second<00:02:16.490> wall<00:02:16.640> dead<00:02:18.460> third<00:02:19.460> wall<00:02:19.730> dead<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
second wall dead third wall dead and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.480 
second wall dead third wall dead and
fourth<00:02:22.430> wall<00:02:22.670> straight<00:02:23.360> through<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:25.160> hole<00:02:25.340> in

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
fourth wall straight through the hole in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.810 
fourth wall straight through the hole in
the<00:02:25.580> first<00:02:25.790> wall<00:02:26.080> second<00:02:27.080> wall<00:02:27.550> third<00:02:28.550> wall

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
the first wall second wall third wall

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.780 
the first wall second wall third wall
fourth<00:02:29.630> wall<00:02:29.840> look<00:02:29.990> at<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.140> spread<00:02:30.790> all

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
fourth wall look at that spread all

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.570 
fourth wall look at that spread all
within<00:02:32.120> probably<00:02:32.720> six<00:02:33.110> feet<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.250> number

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
within probably six feet so that number

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580 
within probably six feet so that number
four<00:02:34.730> penetrated<00:02:35.240> all<00:02:35.480> four<00:02:35.750> walls<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.380> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
four penetrated all four walls so I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.140 
four penetrated all four walls so I
