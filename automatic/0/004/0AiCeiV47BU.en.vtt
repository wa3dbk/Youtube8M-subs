past sides like this like a Titan would
have<00:01:32.570> see<00:01:33.570> their<00:01:33.750> goals

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.520 

and<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.890> straight<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.430> middle

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
and then one straight in the middle

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.730 
and then one straight in the middle
problem<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> matter<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.460> wand<00:01:42.740> there's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
problem is with a matter of wand there's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.170 
problem is with a matter of wand there's
no<00:01:44.040> hole<00:01:44.550> on<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> side<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.950> thread<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.970> let

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
no hole on the side of a thread to let

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.040 
no hole on the side of a thread to let
the<00:01:48.330> air<00:01:48.510> come<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.870> had

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
the air come out so I think if you had

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.340 
the air come out so I think if you had
another<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> could<00:01:52.830> just<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.760> little

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
another one you could just put a little

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
another one you could just put a little
little<00:01:55.350> hole<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.040> wanted<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.390> be

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
little hole if you wanted to and it be

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.410 
little hole if you wanted to and it be
come<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.470> like<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.650> Titan<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.400> the<00:02:00.090> air<00:02:00.300> would

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
come more like a Titan and the air would

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
come more like a Titan and the air would
pass<00:02:00.690> but<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.590> works<00:02:01.800> really<00:02:01.950> well<00:02:03.830> now<00:02:04.830> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
pass but this works really well now this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.219

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
no the problem with air is that it will

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.210 
no the problem with air is that it will

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.540 

okay<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> freshman

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
these now this one is a little bit

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.910 
these now this one is a little bit
different<00:04:45.200> as<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.380> can<00:04:45.620> see<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.770> has<00:04:45.890> a

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
different as you can see it has a

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.260 
different as you can see it has a
stopper<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.700> same<00:04:49.910> idea<00:04:50.360> as<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.510> others

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
stopper but the same idea as the others

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.940 
stopper but the same idea as the others
it's<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.540> soaked<00:04:53.930> in<00:04:54.170> there<00:04:54.380> that<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.710> tip<00:04:54.920> of

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
it's so soaked in there that the tip of

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:05.129 
it's so soaked in there that the tip of
that<00:04:55.420> see<00:04:56.420> it<00:04:56.510> it's<00:04:57.440> wet

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.860 

I<00:05:05.490> was<00:05:06.490> like<00:05:06.669> cooked<00:05:06.939> for<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.120> little<00:05:07.300> bit

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:31.109 

they've<00:05:10.870> changed<00:05:11.169> sounds

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:31.119 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:35.040 

now<00:05:32.119> the<00:05:32.210> difference<00:05:32.659> between<00:05:32.779> cartomizers

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
now the difference between cartomizers

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.749 
now the difference between cartomizers
and<00:05:36.050> regular<00:05:36.439> atomizers<00:05:37.069> is<00:05:39.099> from<00:05:40.099> life<00:05:40.309> and

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
and regular atomizers is from life and

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.499 
and regular atomizers is from life and
you<00:05:41.029> get<00:05:41.180> more<00:05:41.300> air<00:05:41.659> with<00:05:41.869> this<00:05:43.089> it's<00:05:44.089> not<00:05:44.240> that

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
you get more air with this it's not that

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.299 
you get more air with this it's not that
they're<00:05:44.689> bad<00:05:45.189> it's<00:05:46.189> the<00:05:46.369> very<00:05:46.580> different<00:05:48.309> you

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:49.309 
they're bad it's the very different you

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.450 
they're bad it's the very different you
just<00:05:49.520> don't<00:05:49.759> get<00:05:49.999> the<00:05:50.869> overpowering<00:05:51.499> throat

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
just don't get the overpowering throat

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.790 
just don't get the overpowering throat
hit<00:05:52.879> that<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.360> get<00:05:53.629> with<00:05:53.869> a<00:05:53.899> regular<00:05:54.110> atomizer

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
hit that you get with a regular atomizer

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.269 
hit that you get with a regular atomizer
through<00:05:55.580> different<00:05:56.469> but<00:05:57.469> I<00:05:57.740> mean<00:05:58.099> I've<00:05:58.249> been

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
pretty good for price I think if you're

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.309 
pretty good for price I think if you're
a<00:06:07.189> heavy<00:06:07.339> paper<00:06:07.639> you<00:06:08.300> may<00:06:08.509> go<00:06:08.689> through<00:06:08.869> to<00:06:09.139> the

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
a heavy paper you may go through to the

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:16.839 
a heavy paper you may go through to the
day<00:06:12.520> so<00:06:14.199> some<00:06:15.199> places<00:06:15.439> in<00:06:15.740> 1200<00:06:16.189> or<00:06:16.369> some<00:06:16.669> are

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
day so some places in 1200 or some are

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.429 
day so some places in 1200 or some are
nine<00:06:18.610> it's<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.699> little<00:06:19.999> bit<00:06:20.119> more<00:06:20.360> I<00:06:20.389> think<00:06:20.689> and

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
nine it's a little bit more I think and

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.320 
nine it's a little bit more I think and
get<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.860> ball<00:06:22.039> of<00:06:22.189> liquid<00:06:22.339> but<00:06:22.669> I<00:06:22.969> mean

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
get the ball of liquid but I mean

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.779 
get the ball of liquid but I mean
there's<00:06:23.509> no<00:06:23.659> hassle<00:06:23.899> you<00:06:24.439> just<00:06:24.680> hook<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.550> up

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
there's no hassle you just hook it up

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.649 
there's no hassle you just hook it up
tape<00:06:26.089> it<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.569> a<00:06:26.629> dies<00:06:26.809> throw<00:06:27.499> it<00:06:27.559> away<00:06:27.680> you<00:06:28.659> can

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
tape it to a dies throw it away you can

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.439 
tape it to a dies throw it away you can
refill<00:06:30.050> them<00:06:30.199> but<00:06:30.999> it's<00:06:31.999> not<00:06:32.059> really<00:06:32.389> the

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
refill them but it's not really the

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.420 
refill them but it's not really the
point<00:06:32.689> of<00:06:32.899> these<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.319> point<00:06:33.559> of<00:06:33.740> these<00:06:33.889> is<00:06:34.189> to

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
point of these the point of these is to

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.689 
point of these the point of these is to
be<00:06:34.580> able<00:06:34.669> to<00:06:35.289> not<00:06:36.289> screw<00:06:36.800> with<00:06:36.830> anything<00:06:37.459> you

be able to not screw with anything you
just<00:06:37.729> make<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.509> toss<00:06:38.809> it<00:06:39.080> so<00:06:39.379> it's<00:06:40.249> more<00:06:40.459> like

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
just make it toss it so it's more like

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.110 
just make it toss it so it's more like
smoking<00:06:41.089> cigarettes<00:06:41.449> in<00:06:41.870> my<00:06:42.050> opinion<00:06:42.969> so<00:06:43.969> you

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
smoking cigarettes in my opinion so you

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.879 
smoking cigarettes in my opinion so you
don't<00:06:44.269> want<00:06:44.419> to<00:06:44.509> mess<00:06:44.719> with<00:06:44.889> cartomizers

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889

maybe<00:06:46.189> way<00:06:46.430> to<00:06:46.490> go<00:06:47.979> give<00:06:48.979> it<00:06:49.099> a<00:06:49.159> while<00:06:49.339> before

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
maybe way to go give it a while before

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:59.000 
maybe way to go give it a while before
it<00:06:49.999> really<00:06:50.120> starts<00:06:50.240> to<00:06:50.599> kick<00:06:50.719> in

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:05.260 

I<00:07:00.500> don't<00:07:01.500> want<00:07:01.620> to<00:07:01.680> do<00:07:01.800> the<00:07:01.980> other<00:07:02.250> one<00:07:04.160> well

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:16.840 
you thought when I first started taking
here<00:07:08.250> just<00:07:08.810> CCS<00:07:14.300> my<00:07:15.300> the<00:07:15.360> fresh<00:07:15.720> one

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
like I said it takes a while for they

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.950

actually<00:07:19.350> start<00:07:19.620> working<00:07:20.570> this<00:07:21.570> is<00:07:21.780> one<00:07:21.930> of

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
actually start working this is one of

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:30.830
