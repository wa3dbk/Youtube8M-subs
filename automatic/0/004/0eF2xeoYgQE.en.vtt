00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.820
 many gardeners encounter in such 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.430
 the problem is that i was not blooming all white 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.740
 the color of the ovary seems to have started 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.380
 passes nikah manifestations and practically 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.100
 everything lies on the ground nothing this arises 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.190
 among others, this is most likely to begin 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.900
 is that the trees are just not 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.879
 there is not enough power 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 and that is, each plant has trees 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.230
 crop self-regulation processes that is 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.150
 in simple terms plants 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.620
 pretends how much he has food 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.780
 as they have ovaries 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.699
 and how much in theory can she 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.970
 feed and give dear but only not 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.970
 dump so naturally our 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.040
 the challenge is to power 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.080
 give to the tree and naturally for in 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.080
 subsequently increasing the amount of harvest 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 how is it done well for a start 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.250
 need to see where we are 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.460
 crown ends 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 that is, look at the tree where 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330
 all these twigs end here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 our 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.090
 i.e. this periphery of the crown perimeter 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.670
 exactly there are underground 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 suck and small roots of the same 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.729
 wood 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.880
 that is, therefore we conclude that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.510
 fertilizer is applied right here in these 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.090
 places 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.220
 in other words , they noticed where she was 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.950
 the side ends further along 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 perimeter on the ground is dug 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.479
 small groove somewhere deep 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.670
 centimeters 8-10 thousand bayonet shovels and here 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.880
 and so she will serve you later 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.280
 already for fertilizer can be 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.070
 use anything from organics with 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.619
 good nitrogen content for example 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.049
 slurry can use chicken 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.970
 litter however follow strictly instruction 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.130
 on concentration and make the calculation of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.860
 about here you imagine 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.210
 gets it furrow it's breaking a from 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.140
 calculating approximately 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.850
 one slurry bucket for example 2 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.440
 meters here this furrow 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.070
 then of course you can, in principle, something 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.430
 from mineral fertilizers basically in 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.430
 bowl, but if you make a manure 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.170
 hole in principle it will be enough 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.500
 if you want some mineral 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.260
 fertilizer to make something like if 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.750
 regards phosphate superphosphate this 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 about 10-15 grams 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.480
 nac one square meter if it is potassium 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.170
 potassium sulphate can be used 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.130
 these are about 8 grams too 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.980
 square meter if it's nitrogen principle 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.570
 better nitrogen in the form of organic 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.590
 use but if you have urea or 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.910
 ammonium nitrate it is the same again 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.910
 10-15 grams per square meter 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.430
 further still such a moment 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.500
 but in a hole dug counted 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.310
 how much do you need 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.720
 and put a debate on it let's say you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 used again slurry 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.910
 mullein or some herbal infusion 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.910
 for example nettle infusion further you this 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.700
 you or according to the instructions in this 2 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.970
 the city must necessarily 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.030
 bury back and best shed 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.490
 again also all top dressing is better not 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.520
 spend if a very long time was 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.160
 dry weather need tree 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.130
 necessarily good good shed for 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.970
 day though that's what it's done for 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.530
 you will not let it go right away 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.840
 make either mineral even 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.270
 organic fertilizer their concentration 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.420
 soil will be very high roots there 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.260
 you want gentle enough thin you can 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.140
 just burn these solutions therefore 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.930
 to reduce this concentration so that it 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.410
 there was and was softer at first well 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.340
 well it sheds soil and then later as 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.340
 fertilizer is applied 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.860
 It turns out how to make fertilizer look 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.370
 when it is about to fall away more precisely from the bloom 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.650
 Apple tree 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.900
 further after that you can immediately 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.720
 digging around the periphery of the crown groove 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.180
 80 centimeters deep after this 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.750
 we bring the chosen fertilizer in 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.220
 recommended proportions further 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.410
 we dig in and spill very well 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.680
 so about the fall of the call will not 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.680
 less
