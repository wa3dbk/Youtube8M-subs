okay<00:02:18.799> now<00:02:19.040> what<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:19.730> going<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.909> try<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.269> do<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
okay now what I'm going to try and do is

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.179 
okay now what I'm going to try and do is
to<00:02:20.629> get<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:21.200> jam<00:02:21.439> right<00:02:21.709> down<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.159> that

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
to get that to jam right down in that

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.509 
to get that to jam right down in that
little<00:02:22.489> hole<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.829> hopefully<00:02:24.829> that<00:02:25.189> will<00:02:25.340> give

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
little hole and hopefully that will give

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.640 
little hole and hopefully that will give
it<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.819> link<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.750> needed<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:29.379> for<00:02:30.379> it<00:02:30.470> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
it the link that's needed to for it to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:46.330 
it the link that's needed to for it to
not<00:02:30.950> spill<00:02:31.459> out<00:02:44.439> okay<00:02:45.439> I<00:02:45.470> think<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.890> finally<00:02:46.189> got
