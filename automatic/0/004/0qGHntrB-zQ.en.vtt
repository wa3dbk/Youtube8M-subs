00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
HKS is the worldwide architectural front

HKS is the worldwide architectural front
is<00:00:10.530> very<00:00:10.740> diversified<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.210> quite<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> few

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
is very diversified we have quite a few

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.589 
is very diversified we have quite a few
different<00:00:13.980> sectors<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.000> work<00:00:15.210> through

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
different sectors that we work through

different sectors that we work through
and<00:00:15.839> Sports<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.460> them<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:17.880> h

guess<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.630> actually<00:00:18.960> probably<00:00:19.109> more<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
guess is is actually probably more of a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.529 
guess is is actually probably more of a
design<00:00:20.070> firm<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.850> least<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.150> becoming

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
design firm or at least it's becoming

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.000 
design firm or at least it's becoming

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
more of a design firm then an

even<00:01:28.680> had<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:28.979> back<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.430> make<00:01:29.610> sure<00:01:29.640> we

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
even had to go back in and make sure we

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.240 
even had to go back in and make sure we
work<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.540> realistic<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.800> people<00:01:32.100> would

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
work to realistic that people would

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.649 
work to realistic that people would
always<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.670> sitting<00:01:33.090> there<00:01:33.210> would<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.420> people

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
always be sitting there would be people

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.060 
always be sitting there would be people
standing<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.229> front<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.799> sort<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
standing in front of you that sort of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
standing in front of you that sort of
thing<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.700> took<00:01:35.969> it<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.329> definitely<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> next

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
thing so we took it to definitely a next

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
thing so we took it to definitely a next
level<00:01:37.290> we're<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> first<00:01:38.850> ones

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
level we're the one of the first ones

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
level we're the one of the first ones
actually<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.360> put<00:01:39.860> suites<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> field

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
actually to put suites on the field

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
actually to put suites on the field
level<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.869> unheard<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.350> because

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
level which was unheard of because

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
level which was unheard of because
essentially<00:01:44.280> people<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:44.759> standing<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.240> front

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
essentially people are standing in front

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
essentially people are standing in front
of<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.719> well<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.039> 3d<00:01:47.490> views

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
of you well through the use of 3d views

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
of you well through the use of 3d views
we<00:01:48.149> actually<00:01:48.420> allowed<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.079> see

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
we actually allowed you to really see

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
we actually allowed you to really see
what<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.039> those<00:01:50.729> things<00:01:50.969> sell

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
what it was like those things sell

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
what it was like those things sell
faster<00:01:51.750> than<00:01:51.899> any<00:01:52.049> other<00:01:52.439> Sweden<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
faster than any other Sweden in the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
faster than any other Sweden in the
whole<00:01:53.250> building<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.810> there<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
whole building and there it's the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
whole building and there it's the
weirdest<00:01:55.560> seat<00:01:55.740> too<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.280> essentially<00:01:56.789> that's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
weirdest seat too but essentially that's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.999 
weirdest seat too but essentially that's
what<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> did<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.990> panoramic<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:58.740> allowed

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
what it did the panoramic which allowed

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.099 
what it did the panoramic which allowed
you<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.280> look<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.579> anything<00:01:59.909> allowed<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
you to look at anything allowed you to

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.260 
you to look at anything allowed you to
really<00:02:01.229> understand<00:02:02.130> why<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> great

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
really understand why that was a great

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.120 
really understand why that was a great
space<00:02:03.659> which<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.409> would<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.619> never<00:02:04.799> gotten

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
space which you would have never gotten

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
space which you would have never gotten
to<00:02:05.250> until<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> building<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.299> completely

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to until the building was completely

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
to until the building was completely
built<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.320> someone<00:02:07.590> physically<00:02:08.009> walked<00:02:08.340> down

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
built and someone physically walked down

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.950
