so<00:00:01.880> when<00:00:02.000> you<00:00:02.090> select<00:00:02.240> implants<00:00:02.900> there's<00:00:03.049> lots

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
so when you select implants there's lots

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.960 
so when you select implants there's lots
of<00:00:03.409> different<00:00:03.799> colors<00:00:04.130> and<00:00:04.339> finishes<00:00:04.520> out

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
of different colors and finishes out

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.700 
of different colors and finishes out
there<00:00:05.240> so<00:00:05.720> let's<00:00:05.870> have<00:00:05.960> a<00:00:06.050> look<00:00:06.200> at<00:00:06.320> the<00:00:06.440> types

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
there so let's have a look at the types

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.410 
there so let's have a look at the types
of<00:00:06.950> finishes<00:00:07.130> and<00:00:07.490> actually<00:00:07.940> where<00:00:08.179> they're

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
of finishes and actually where they're

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.330 
of finishes and actually where they're
best<00:00:08.720> used<00:00:09.110> first<00:00:09.740> thing<00:00:09.950> we're<00:00:10.040> starting

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
best used first thing we're starting

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.440 
best used first thing we're starting
with<00:00:10.430> the<00:00:10.519> emulsion<00:00:10.700> paints<00:00:11.030> you<00:00:11.120> get<00:00:11.210> two

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
with the emulsion paints you get two

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.390 
with the emulsion paints you get two
main<00:00:11.750> finishes<00:00:12.320> one<00:00:12.500> being<00:00:12.800> matte<00:00:13.040> among

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
main finishes one being matte among

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.520 
main finishes one being matte among
being<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.700> silk<00:00:13.970> we<00:00:14.780> started<00:00:15.080> with<00:00:15.170> the<00:00:15.260> silk

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
being the silk we started with the silk

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.169 
being the silk we started with the silk
and<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.039> best<00:00:16.219> way<00:00:16.369> of<00:00:16.429> checking<00:00:16.759> that<00:00:17.029> is

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:17.179 
and the best way of checking that is

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.909 
and the best way of checking that is
obviously<00:00:17.509> as<00:00:17.659> you<00:00:17.810> see<00:00:17.989> on<00:00:18.079> the<00:00:18.230> pack<00:00:18.409> it<00:00:18.769> does

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:18.919 
obviously as you see on the pack it does

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.679 
obviously as you see on the pack it does
clearly<00:00:19.249> indicate<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.939> finish<00:00:20.239> on<00:00:20.449> their

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
clearly indicate the finish on their

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.169 
clearly indicate the finish on their
silks<00:00:21.499> ideal<00:00:21.949> as<00:00:22.159> a<00:00:22.220> highly<00:00:22.909> reflective

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
silks ideal as a highly reflective

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.269 
silks ideal as a highly reflective
finish<00:00:23.659> for<00:00:24.199> areas<00:00:24.499> where<00:00:24.649> you<00:00:24.800> want<00:00:24.949> to<00:00:25.189> have

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
finish for areas where you want to have

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.919 
finish for areas where you want to have

a maximum amount to light so in the

a maximum amount to light so in the

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
bit darker that particularly will bounce

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.870

the<00:00:30.259> light<00:00:30.349> off<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:30.979> give<00:00:31.309> you<00:00:31.399> much<00:00:31.550> brighter

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
the light off and give you much brighter

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.000 
the light off and give you much brighter
finish<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.900> then<00:00:33.020> we<00:00:33.110> have<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.350> matte<00:00:33.680> finish

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
finish and then we have the matte finish

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.220 
finish and then we have the matte finish
which<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.340> indicated<00:00:34.910> again<00:00:35.000> on<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.480> can<00:00:35.690> this

coat<00:01:32.749> paints<00:01:33.109> are<00:01:33.259> an<00:01:33.350> ideal<00:01:33.709> solution<00:01:33.999> the

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
coat paints are an ideal solution the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.980 
coat paints are an ideal solution the
way<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.209> work<00:01:35.359> is<00:01:35.539> they<00:01:35.630> have<00:01:35.749> a<00:01:35.780> lot<00:01:35.959> more

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
way the work is they have a lot more

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.779 
way the work is they have a lot more
pigment<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.799> which<00:01:37.069> gives<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> better

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
pigment in which gives you a better

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.789 
pigment in which gives you a better
covering<00:01:38.359> than<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.600> conventional<00:01:38.780> paint<00:01:39.380> so

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
covering than a conventional paint so

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.020 
covering than a conventional paint so
therefore<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.189> can<00:01:40.280> get<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.459> job<00:01:40.639> done<00:01:40.700> in

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
therefore you can get the job done in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.050 
therefore you can get the job done in
one<00:01:41.179> go<00:01:42.310> when<00:01:43.310> you're<00:01:43.429> looking<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:43.700> paint<00:01:43.909> your

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
actually a jelly formulation which means

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:02.709 
actually a jelly formulation which means
that<00:02:01.069> you<00:02:01.159> can<00:02:01.310> transfer<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.789> from<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.270> to

that you can transfer it from the can to
the<00:02:02.869> surface<00:02:03.229> without<00:02:03.529> getting<00:02:03.799> all<00:02:03.950> those

the surface without getting all those

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.459 
the surface without getting all those
runs<00:02:04.429> or<00:02:04.670> sags<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.779> that's<00:02:05.959> your<00:02:06.079> non<00:02:06.229> drip

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
gloss for a more softer subtle finish we

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.740 
gloss for a more softer subtle finish we
have<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.740> non<00:02:09.950> dipped<00:02:10.190> satin

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
have the non dipped satin

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.450 
have the non dipped satin
this<00:02:11.110> gives<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.440> very<00:02:11.680> modern<00:02:12.100> sort<00:02:12.370> of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
this gives a very modern sort of

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.550 
this gives a very modern sort of
contemporary<00:02:13.030> feel<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.570> as<00:02:13.900> he's<00:02:14.110> very<00:02:14.290> easy

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
contemporary feel and as he's very easy

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.250 
contemporary feel and as he's very easy
to<00:02:14.830> apply<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.940> also<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.240> water-based<00:02:16.870> system

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
to apply it's also a water-based system

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.500 
to apply it's also a water-based system
so<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.710> dries<00:02:17.950> very<00:02:18.280> very<00:02:18.490> quickly<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> extract

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
so it dries very very quickly to extract

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.690 
so it dries very very quickly to extract
about<00:02:19.630> an<00:02:19.930> hour<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.010> best<00:02:21.160> results<00:02:21.610> so

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
about an hour but for best results so

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
about an hour but for best results so
you<00:02:21.820> don't<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.270> those<00:02:22.450> brush<00:02:22.750> marks<00:02:23.170> we

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
you don't get those brush marks we

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.410 
you don't get those brush marks we
suggest<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.070> use<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.280> synthetic<00:02:24.610> bristle

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
suggest that you use a synthetic bristle

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.240 
suggest that you use a synthetic bristle
brush<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:26.140> will<00:02:26.290> give<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> best<00:02:26.890> finish

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
brush this will give you the best finish

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.510 
brush this will give you the best finish
with<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.580> non<00:02:27.790> drip<00:02:28.060> setting
