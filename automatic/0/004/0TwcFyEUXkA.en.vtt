00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.740
 because you love I want to stop now 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.939
 210 most active video turn and that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.830
 I want to open up a little bit more 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.910
 take your questions and have yourself 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.930
 sometimes a few thoughts how 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.849
 Some people may do things 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.340
 could explain a little better 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.689
 because, for example, with the food 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.840
 Times was not quite so 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.640
 quite understood and that's how I start 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.770
 just stop and hold the fish 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.140
 I said yes every horse at 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.040
 our active stall of 24 about four 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.629
 up to five hours 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.129
 I do not know exactly that could be synonymous 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.220
 But I can be a little bit more 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.290
 ask for it and it was like that 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.880
 understood that if four horses then 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.160
 The 21st have five hours of free time 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.570
 hours do not get anything but that he 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.550
 it does not make sense at the moment 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.290
 Actively, that's what it's all about 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.010
 that they feel not only move 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.950
 but also as close to nature as possible 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.920
 eat small portions and you can 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.060
 I believe up to 20 portions in 24 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.619
 ration for hours 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.329
 but we do that with us 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.649
 least and I have to be honest 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.430
 have promised nothing at the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.770
 just first in the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.979
 basic settings that would have to be left 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.960
 so I believe five portions to six 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.609
 servings a day to be is in summer 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 obviously different because in the summer the 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.460
 Whole day in the meadow are after 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.869
 Do not eat so much 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.659
 us in the summer, not even that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.130
 this year he works 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.569
 me then just so that she is not five 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.700
 Otherwise, it would be hours to eat 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.509
 yes , even worse than in one 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 instructions for example open stall 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.740
 is at all and yes I would say 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.429
 that the horses are about 15 to 20 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.590
 minutes per feeding unit 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.819
 and also if they get shooed 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.819
 will be from others from behind 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.130
 or so then the gate goes too 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.450
 within a short time down the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.399
 is have the horse has really quite 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.420
 many small portions and get the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.139
 also regardless of whether others that 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.999
 want to steal 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:09.280
 I really liked doing it from the back 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.810
 Bite the butt and then as long as the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.830
 others annoy bisse from going out and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.840
 then again very fast the whole 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.310
 call home then later relish too 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 eat if I think so 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.510
 maybe we have the lowest ranking 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 the weaker ones 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.379
 a little more, I'll say that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.569
 But basically there is no 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.720
 horse too skinny partly they are more likely to 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.610
 yes, then what else really interesting 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.409
 Apparently it was like social 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.329
 weak or very dominant horses 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.390
 I can work out of ours 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.629
 position just say that once a very 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.579
 dominant horse is two horses the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.400
 a little impressing from the 24 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.500
 otherwise, if he likes to come away beyond 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.549
 he just wants to be a friend but he kicks 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.049
 not and that is just like that 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.829
 other fathers very pleasant then too 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.139
 socially weak horses yes that's just 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.760
 really a bit difficult because of that 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.280
 are just the candidates with us has 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.700
 really a bit narrower say 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.319
 I will be partly then still has 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.970
 Feeding further outside the stable 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.409
 So from the owners themselves to the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.760
 ride or so but most come 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.810
 Really, of course, they just go 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.489
 when the others come 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.109
 many have learned that when they do 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.180
 times in the feeders are that they 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.040
 then just have to leave so that the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.489
 to go away from the front and from the other 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.139
 the side nobody can come and come 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.169
 accordingly well with it clear 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.910
 and yes others will see you then 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.500
 shut up, I say 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.470
 moment a study at our stall the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.199
 been there for four months and that became 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.879
 just sewed over the eye because they are the 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:44.129
 sunday fourth kicked off 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.889
 Your blankets are in the weekly cycle 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.239
 broken but that's just the really 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.669
 exception so with the blankets it is 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.650
 actually quite difficult with us 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.359
 but basically there are the horses 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 really great I think it can be 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.540
 Nobody complain then I want you 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.419
 again the essential differences to the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.370
 clearly show normal open stall 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.049
 because many, I do not think so yet 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.870
 have seen all the difference 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.239
 And that's not just the food 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.310
 The active city is called namely 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.120
 actually movement instead of it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.739
 was that born 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.449
 that is the meaning behind that 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.310
 the horses should run a lot because 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.739
 they just have small amounts of food 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.820
 in one corner is the food 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.110
 stand in the anna 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.250
 he drinks space and in the other 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.630
 again the straw hall and in the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.460
 last then still the power food 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.860
 stand accordingly because of the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.670
 horse really a lot not just for play 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.380
 or what do I know 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.550
 but mainly also for 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.700
 eat and while yours 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.400
 pursue natural needs and 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.570
 what I think is really great 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.370
 why an open stable is likely 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.950
 rather not for us would be in question 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.600
 except that either heu 24 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.150
 hours is available or even 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.460
 Only at certain meals I still 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.120
 is reasonable to think that with the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.130
 concentrated feed 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.930
 I have not experienced any variant where 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.300
 it's really going to be at offenstall 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.440
 easy and a good solution was around 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.270
 to feed fodder 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.830
 I only know that so that once in the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.900
 Open stable on the day before the owners 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.390
 even if the horses are outside what 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.340
 is fed or just in the morning and 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.660
 in the evening in Verden and be separated like that 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.370
 What is there near us like that 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.630
 I do not believe and there I am 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.730
 really glad that he is active 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.460
 Rock hard and there several times a day even 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.660
 to be able to pick up smaller quantities of oats 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.400
 after now also the question 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.220
 how much did that turn up? 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.650
 move fields active steel I have that 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.700
 have a look and I'm on 7 to 16 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.590
 kilometers have come 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.330
 I feel like I know it 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.520
 Do not sammer and I think it was too 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.860
 difficult in a gps system or else 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.600
 to equip something 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.280
 And yes, other benefits are just 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.290
 not only that the horses a certain 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.480
 have basic condition because they are secure 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.940
 always moving and not like your boxing 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.480
 Colleagues partly in winter only for 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.280
 two to three hours out and come 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.870
 I also noticed that samba since then 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.790
 active city stands also if he before 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.390
 nevertheless all day or middle 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.700
 half-day outside stood yes he is a lot 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.550
 Faster was easy because the horses 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.900
 do not have to step out first 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.340
 should be active then immediately 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.230
 can start working mostly and 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.270
 even want to work on 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.100
 not your own area 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.240
 it is possible to ride 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.980
 you have me off for the merck after the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.550
 Cost asked what I always active city 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.650
 pay 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.540
 I would like to thank you for the praise itself 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.340
 do not say anything just because at 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.870
 us on the homepage does not stand and me 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.840
 Do not want to put anything on the internet 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.919
 Owner does not want to but you 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.750
 Maybe you can imagine that 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.530
 if they do not praise themselves to the boxes 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.150
 I agree to sign 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.740
 yes that's really fair prices 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.640
 and you could really think about it 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.110
 maybe this time 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.820
 Try it if you have something like that 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.280
 because the prices are not there 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.510
 differ and seriously i would 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.600
 also prefer to spend more for that 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.880
 my horse is actively steep 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.590
 provided it clearly comes so yes i 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.140
 I hope all of you ask me out of that 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.110
 have cleared away and that I have mine 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.060
 weight not so annoying hope you 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.260
 like the video and will be synonymous in 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.050
 future I look like the part 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.010
 see one more videos then explained 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.010
 be sat down with purely
