which<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> game<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.859> played<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> lot

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
which was a game that I played a lot

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
which was a game that I played a lot
when<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.180> little<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.260> favorites

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
when I was little one of my favorites

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
when I was little one of my favorites
but<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.010> never<00:00:29.189> able<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> pass<00:00:29.939> even<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
but I was never able to pass even a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.359 
but I was never able to pass even a
single<00:00:30.630> level<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.890> great<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
single level so it was really great to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.450 
single level so it was really great to
actually<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> game<00:00:33.390> completed<00:00:34.079> um<00:00:34.460> we
