I<00:00:39.719> did<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.800> particular<00:00:41.309> grouping<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.420> in

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
I did this particular grouping and in

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.350 
I did this particular grouping and in
the<00:00:43.559> future<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> talk<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.489> paintings

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
when I talk about the families that will

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.450 
when I talk about the families that will
give<00:00:48.090> some<00:00:48.450> better<00:00:49.170> understanding<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> why

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
give some better understanding of why

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.950 
give some better understanding of why
the<00:00:50.520> paintings<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.210> grouped<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.750> they

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the paintings are grouped the way they

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.910 
the paintings are grouped the way they
are<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> reason<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> paintings

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
are and the reason that the paintings

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
are and the reason that the paintings
and<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.399> group<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.030> called<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> rural

and in this group are called the rural

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
and in this group are called the rural
South<00:00:58.250> it's<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.390> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
South it's because they have that in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.200

the mid-fifties the late fifties there

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
the mid-fifties the late fifties there
were<00:02:41.599> closing<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> lives<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:45.180> 60s

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
were closing on the lives but in the 60s

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.839 
were closing on the lives but in the 60s
70s<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.560> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> disappeared<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.730> we

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
70s that kind of disappeared and we

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.170 
70s that kind of disappeared and we
forgot<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.890> people<00:02:49.890> aren't<00:02:50.459> closed<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
forgot that people aren't closed on the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.830 
forgot that people aren't closed on the
lines<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:51.959> when<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.040> drove<00:02:53.790> through<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.569> south

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
lines but when I drove through the south

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.430 
lines but when I drove through the south
I<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:56.190> fat<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:58.079> kind<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
I know this fat and so I was kind of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920 
I know this fat and so I was kind of
fascinated<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.819> many<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.900> my

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
fascinated with it so many of my

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.309 
fascinated with it so many of my
paintings<00:03:01.579> will<00:03:02.579> have<00:03:02.849> clothing<00:03:03.269> hanging<00:03:04.170> on

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
paintings will have clothing hanging on

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.699 
paintings will have clothing hanging on
them<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> clotheslines<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:07.260> that's<00:03:07.470> one

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
them on the clotheslines so that's one

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.069

large<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.190> there<00:04:14.459> was<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:15.139> person<00:04:16.139> sitting<00:04:17.010> on

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789

the<00:04:18.030> road<00:04:18.269> under<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.139> tree<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:19.889> when<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.639> drew

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
the road under the tree but when I drew

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.910 
the road under the tree but when I drew
it<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.690> person<00:04:22.169> looked

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
it the person looked

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.660 
it the person looked
scale<00:04:23.220> because<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:24.420> tree<00:04:24.720> was<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.670> gigantic

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
scale because the tree was so gigantic

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.250 
scale because the tree was so gigantic
it<00:04:26.940> was<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.630> huge<00:04:28.290> tree<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.310> person

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
it was to a huge tree and the person

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.910 
it was to a huge tree and the person
looked<00:04:31.260> out<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.440> scale<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:33.290> espera<00:04:34.290> tlie<00:04:34.470> wanted

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
looked out of scale I espera tlie wanted

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.790 
looked out of scale I espera tlie wanted
to<00:04:35.070> draw<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.400> tree<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:37.320> person<00:04:37.770> just

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
to draw that tree but that person just

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.290 
to draw that tree but that person just
wasn't<00:04:38.160> going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.550> work<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.960> took<00:04:40.340> an<00:04:41.340> image

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
wasn't going to work so I took an image

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.640 
wasn't going to work so I took an image
of<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:43.230> man<00:04:43.530> playing<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.550> guitar<00:04:44.730> and<00:04:45.390> put<00:04:46.170> him<00:04:46.410> in

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
of a man playing a guitar and put him in

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.550 
of a man playing a guitar and put him in
that<00:04:47.040> scene<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:48.450> what<00:04:48.660> i<00:04:48.690> thought<00:04:49.110> was<00:04:49.350> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
that scene to what i thought was the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.090 
that scene to what i thought was the
right<00:04:49.590> scale<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:51.390> that's<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:52.100> rationale

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
right scale so that's the rationale

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.300 
right scale so that's the rationale
behind<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:54.090> painting<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.740> learn<00:04:55.920> more<00:04:55.980> about
