 put into the ear boiling and there the eggs 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.739

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.159
 meters and the number 4 of the fund 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.479
 a parasitic worm at one 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.399
 human body is actually already 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.170
 but enough understood when a worm in 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.850
 your brain is found that is 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.920

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.660
 each of us but how disgusting that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.480
