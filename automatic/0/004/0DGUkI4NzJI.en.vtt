00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 today it's all about coffee you 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.630
 See, I already have a bit 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 There is decoration in the café today 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 That's a spice cafe right right 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.800
 delicious and something different 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 You can make coffee with many spices 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.510
 refined with cinnamon with karl amon even 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.090
 with pepper or chilli and I show 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 you guys today how to make a ginger coffee 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.469
 this is actually quite prepared 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.809
 easy 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.219
 I have such a small series here 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.070
 I've already got a little bit ingo 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.340
 isolated 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:55.920
 I'll do a few with that now 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 Strip clean table makes you that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.840
 of course about 15 mm that slice 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.610
 is enough for two to four cups 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.220
 That's perfect when you look at that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.979
 Last look in the bowl really 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 not much about but fresh ginger is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.020
 really recommendable 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.509
 it just has a lot more aroma 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 I always regret my coffee fresh 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.439
 on through a normal coffee filter 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 Reason as a tip if we are with one 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 coffee filter blossoms then give once 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.990
 before giving the coffee the coffee powder 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.840
 winery in the filter bag of hot water 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.790
 they washed quasi from then this 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.759
 musty paper taste the way you 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.009
 sometimes has and the coffee tastes 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.600
 just much more intense 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.600
 I do that now too 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.710
 I decorate a bit more points 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 if you pour yourself coffee on 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.860
 A coffee filter in the can directly 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.330
 then it is very important that the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:19.550
 Can also boil with water before 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.230
 so rinsed about 96 degrees 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.060
 or man is the water like that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.010
 long in there 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.590
 until the next water comes you 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.660
 Need to cook coffee too hot 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.470
 then the camera has a right one 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.190
 temperature that is just essential 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.510
 better for the aroma the baking powder resp 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.250
 it's not the pigs in Ingolstadt 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.380
 I give now the first in the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 coffee filters that are in the bottom 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:57.950
 and then comes freshly ground 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.570
 coffee from my coffee mill to the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.450
 Coffee powder is just really great 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:09.680
 four teaspoons of coffee powder four 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:15.580
 heaped teaspoon of coffee powder to that 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:21.400
 are for two cups 200 milliliters café 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.400
 about when it converts into program 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.100
 30 grams of coffee powder wrong turn 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.370
 wanted to be infused now and that 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.430
 you pour it on the welding technology 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:45.080
 means one pours only a bit 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:50.410
 the aroma can unfold and was called 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.410
 then the crowd runs after 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.300
 until the desired amount of coffee 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:06.290
 gone through is actually that's it 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:13.640
 not difficult to cook my hot water 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:16.010
 showers meadows when painting there 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.090
 different times I just tell that 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.400
 you guys in another video what where 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:28.190
 The differences are from the reminder 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.450
 here for brokers for espresso and then 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.270
 I'll tell you a little bit more 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.620
 what about the quantities you need 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 so you always have a consistent 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.830
 Coffee quality has that's what it is 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.570
 very important, I have that reasonably 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.790
 im feeling i know my spoon i 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.580
 have that balanced time how much 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.620
 coffee powder on my spoon 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.360
 draufgeht 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.980
 and if you are not sure then 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.620
 rather take a kitchen scale then have 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.990
 That's exactly what it takes care of 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.920
 any case, yes, if the coffee is now 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.160
 gone through is the really great aroma 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:09.680
 she always flavored coffee 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:14.480
 It's best with 1 2 teaspoons of honey 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.490
 and maybe with some cream if you 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:23.480
 may enjoy that is just a pure one 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.130
 Coffee enjoy something else and me 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.190
 Hope the coffee tastes the same 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.410
 good as he tastes me and we see 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.170
 then maybe one of us 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.840
 next video is again 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.960
 I would be happy to say that 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.890
 start bye and enjoy 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.890
 my coffee now 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:53.400
 just by yes you have seen coffee 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.400
 cooking is not difficult
