Hey, you it's a brand new day. Everybody's
here to laugh and play. Everybody sing Humf.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:33.340
Everybody Sing Humf. Wallace and Loon, Uncle Hairy Too. My Mum and my Dad are all there with me, and you.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.160
Everybody sing Humf.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.559
Flora Comes to Babysit.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.379
One night, Humf's mum and dad were getting
ready to go out. Uncle Hairy was coming to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.649
babysit and he was bringing his girlfriend,
Flora too.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.400
"He's here, he's here!"

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.160
Humf liked Uncle Hairy a lot.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.160
"Hello"

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.170
"Hi"

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.180
"Hello Humf"

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.190
"Hi"

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.940
Humf liked Uncle Hairy's girlfriend Flora
too. But, "where's Uncle Hairy?"

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.900
"He'll be here soon Humf, he's coming straight
from work"

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.200
Humf's mum and dad talked to Flora in the
kitchen and Humf played driving his tractor

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.060
over the sofa and waiting for Uncle Hairy.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:52.070
And then the phone rang, "Hello" and Humf's dad answered it. "We're going to go out now Humf"

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.260
"But where's Uncle Hairy? He's supposed to
babysit me"

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.560
"Uncle Hairy just phoned, he's running late
but he should be here soon"

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.400
"And in the meantime, Aunty Flora can look
after you"

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.390
Humf liked Flora too but he had never heard
her called Aunty Flora before.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.000
"I'm sure you and Flora will have a lovely
time"

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.920
"But I want Uncle Hairy to read me my bedtime
story with the silly voices"

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.250
"Oh, don't worry Humf, Hairy will be here
in plenty of time to read your bedtime story."

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.510
So Humf's mum and dad went out but there was
still no Uncle Hairy. "Shall we have some

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.870
supper Humf? Your mum tells me that pasta
is your favourite"

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.790
"But Uncle Hairy always makes me peanut butter
sandwiches"

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.510
"Does he? Well, guess what? I know how to
make peanut butter sandwiches too."

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.860
"Really?"

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.940
"Yes, um.. but I don't know where the bread
is."

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.920
"It's over there!" Humf told Flora where to
find the bread and where to find the peanut butter.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.580
But Flora found the plate all by herself and
she made Humf a peanut butter sandwich.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.140
"Ta-da!"

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.020
"Can you cut it up like Uncle Hairy does?"

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.890
"I'll try"

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.020
"But Uncle Hairy cuts them the other way."

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.860
"Oh, you mean in triangles. Ok, I'll cut it
into triangles."

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:57.180
And Flora cut the sandwich into lots of teeny
tiny peanut butter sandwiches and they were all triangles.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.490
Humf had never had that many peanut butter
sandwiches before, but there was still no

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.830
Uncle Hairy.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.960
So after supper, Flora ran Humf a bath and
Humf played in the bubbles and Flora played

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.170
too. "Can the cow come in the bath too?"

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.570
Humf and Flora played swimming aeroplanes
and pigs like to splash.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.920
And then it was time to come out.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:48.060
"That's not my towel, that's dad's towel and
that's mum's towel. My towel is yellow."

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.410
"Oh, silly me!"

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:02.620
Soon, Humf was all ready for bed but there was still no Uncle Hairy. "Where's Uncle Hairy, Flora?"

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.600
"I don't know, but I'm sure he will be here
soon."

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.880
"But I want Uncle Hairy to read my bedtime
story"

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.180
"Well, guess what? I know how to read bedtime
stories too"

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.800
"But Uncle Hairy makes silly voices"

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.500
"Well I know how to make silly voices"

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.230
So Humf got a book to read and climbed into
bed and Flora started to read the story and

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.850
made some very silly voices.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.660
"The pig was very happy. He put on his best
hat. Good morning Mr. Kitten! Or should I

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.840
call you Cat?"

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.639
And then the doorbell rang. "I wonder who
that could be?"

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.160
"Uncle Hairy, he's here, he's here!"

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.850
"Hello Humf, how's my favourite little furry
thing?"

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:10.860
"Come and listen Uncle Hairy. Flora's reading
me a story and she is making silly voices"

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.880
"Oh, Flora knows how to make silly voices
too."

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.639
"Yes, I do"

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.910
So Uncle Hairy and Humf listened together
to Flora reading the rest of the story.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.730
"And the dog and the kitten, the pig and the
cow finished their song and they took a deep bow."

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.760
"Goodnight Humf", "Goodnight"

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:59.360
Humf liked Uncle Hairy a lot and he liked
Aunty Flora a lot too.
