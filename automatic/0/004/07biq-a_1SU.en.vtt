00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
recipe into gluten-free baking I'm

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
recipe into gluten-free baking I'm
taking<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:27.750> mom's<00:00:27.960> banana<00:00:28.199> bread<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.710> turning

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
taking my mom's banana bread and turning

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
taking my mom's banana bread and turning
it<00:00:29.250> into<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> gluten<00:00:29.789> free<00:00:29.820> recipe<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.900> works

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it into a gluten free recipe it works

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
it into a gluten free recipe it works
really<00:00:31.439> well<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> texture<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
really well because of the texture of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
really well because of the texture of
quick<00:00:33.090> breads<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.899> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.290> denser

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
quick breads it's a little bit denser

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 
quick breads it's a little bit denser
and<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.399> something<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.030> gluten<00:00:36.420> free<00:00:36.690> where

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and so something with gluten free where

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.450 
and so something with gluten free where
you<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you don't really get all of that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
you don't really get all of that
elasticity<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> large<00:00:39.540> bubbles<00:00:39.960> muffins

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
elasticity in the large bubbles muffins

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.170 
elasticity in the large bubbles muffins
quick<00:00:41.160> breads<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.879> thing<00:00:42.030> are

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
quick breads that kind of thing are

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.350 
quick breads that kind of thing are
perfect<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.020> gluten<00:00:43.260> free<00:00:43.410> baking<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
perfect with gluten free baking so the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
perfect with gluten free baking so the
first<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.079> mom's<00:00:46.289> banana<00:00:46.500> bread<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
first thing to my mom's banana bread is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.150 
first thing to my mom's banana bread is
a<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.940> bit<00:00:48.149> funny<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.809> adding<00:00:49.230> vinegar<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a little bit funny I'm adding vinegar to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
a little bit funny I'm adding vinegar to
milk<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.090> idea<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> add

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
milk and the idea here is when you add

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.619 
milk and the idea here is when you add
vinegar<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> milk<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> curdles<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.420> milk

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
vinegar to milk it curdles the milk

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
vinegar to milk it curdles the milk
slightly<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> end<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.070> getting<00:00:56.280> are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
slightly so what you end up getting are

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.750 
slightly so what you end up getting are
really<00:00:57.120> rich<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:58.260> dense<00:00:58.649> milk<00:00:59.070> curds<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
really rich little dense milk curds and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
really rich little dense milk curds and
a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> tang<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.440> adds<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
a little bit of a tang and it adds so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
a little bit of a tang and it adds so
much<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> banana<00:01:02.850> bread<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
much to the banana bread so that is a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
much to the banana bread so that is a
holdover<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.320> my<00:01:04.680> mom's<00:01:04.860> recipe<00:01:05.309> next<00:01:05.909> I'm

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
next I'm going to add xantham gum and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
next I'm going to add xantham gum and
xanthan<00:01:46.530> gum<00:01:46.560> acts<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> binder<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.299> any

xanthan gum acts as a binder for any
gluten<00:01:48.990> free<00:01:49.290> flour<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> always<00:01:50.310> need<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
gluten free flour so you always need to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.310 
gluten free flour so you always need to
have<00:01:50.610> xantham<00:01:51.060> gum<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.689> gluten-free<00:01:52.110> recipe

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
have xantham gum in a gluten-free recipe

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.800 
have xantham gum in a gluten-free recipe
next<00:01:54.280> I'm<00:01:54.430> going<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.640> add<00:01:54.790> baking<00:01:55.240> soda<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
next I'm going to add baking soda and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.920 
next I'm going to add baking soda and
this<00:01:56.470> gives<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.860> lift<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.460> banana<00:01:57.730> bread<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
this gives a lift to the banana bread of

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.840 
this gives a lift to the banana bread of
course<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.500> little<00:01:59.890> bit<00:02:00.010> of<00:02:00.100> salt<00:02:00.430> because<00:02:00.670> it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
course a little bit of salt because it

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.800 
course a little bit of salt because it
adds<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.090> lot<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.570> great<00:02:01.840> flavor<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:04.540> I'm<00:02:04.660> going

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
adds a lot of great flavor now I'm going

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.090 
adds a lot of great flavor now I'm going
to<00:02:04.870> sift<00:02:05.080> all<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.410> my<00:02:05.530> ingredients<00:02:05.770> together

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
to sift all of my ingredients together

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.480 
to sift all of my ingredients together
to<00:02:06.430> make<00:02:06.580> sure<00:02:06.610> they're<00:02:06.880> evenly<00:02:07.210> distributed

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
to make sure they're evenly distributed

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.080 
to make sure they're evenly distributed
so<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.890> dry<00:02:12.100> ingredients<00:02:12.250> are<00:02:12.640> ready<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.940> go

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
so my dry ingredients are ready to go

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.700 
so my dry ingredients are ready to go
I'm<00:02:13.270> gonna<00:02:13.450> get<00:02:13.600> started<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:13.990> mashing<00:02:14.500> up<00:02:14.620> my

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
I'm gonna get started with mashing up my

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.490 
I'm gonna get started with mashing up my
bananas<00:02:15.160> there's<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.940> couple<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.690> techniques<00:02:16.990> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
bananas there's a couple of techniques a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.260 
bananas there's a couple of techniques a
couple<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.950> schools<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.520> thought<00:02:18.850> when<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
couple of schools of thought when it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.930 
couple of schools of thought when it
comes<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.690> banana<00:02:20.530> smashing<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.580> can<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.850> it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
comes to banana smashing you can do it

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.940 
comes to banana smashing you can do it
with<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> back<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.450> fork<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.900> bowl<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.740> my

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
with the back of a fork in a bowl but my

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.410 
with the back of a fork in a bowl but my
technique<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:24.370> smashing<00:02:24.820> bananas<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.360> just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
technique for smashing bananas is just

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.180 
technique for smashing bananas is just
taking<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.020> peeled<00:02:26.290> bananas<00:02:26.680> sticking<00:02:27.070> them

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
taking the peeled bananas sticking them

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.530 
taking the peeled bananas sticking them
in<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.340> freezer<00:02:27.550> bag<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.850> motioning<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.420> with

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
in a freezer bag and motioning it with

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.690 
in a freezer bag and motioning it with
my<00:02:28.660> fingers<00:02:29.050> it's<00:02:29.440> great<00:02:29.709> no<00:02:30.040> cleanup<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
my fingers it's great no cleanup and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.580 
my fingers it's great no cleanup and
really<00:02:31.030> easy<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.870> want<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.200> end<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.440> with

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
really easy and I want to end up with

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.250 
really easy and I want to end up with
about<00:02:32.800> three<00:02:33.220> cups<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.760> mashed<00:02:34.150> bananas<00:02:34.810> so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
about three cups of mashed bananas so

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260 
about three cups of mashed bananas so
that's<00:02:35.380> about<00:02:35.530> five<00:02:35.920> whole<00:02:36.280> bananas<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
that's about five whole bananas the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.970 
that's about five whole bananas the
reason<00:02:37.600> why<00:02:37.750> I'm<00:02:37.990> mushing<00:02:38.230> bananas<00:02:38.800> rather

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
reason why I'm mushing bananas rather

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.140 
reason why I'm mushing bananas rather
than<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.400> sticking<00:02:39.700> them<00:02:39.820> in<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.970> food

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
than just sticking them in a food

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
little clumps of banana they add so much

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.190 
little clumps of banana they add so much
flavor<00:02:46.600> when<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.959> slice<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:48.660> well<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:49.959> looks

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
flavor when you slice it well this looks

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.900 
flavor when you slice it well this looks
sufficiently<00:02:50.590> mashed<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.310> me<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:51.580> these<00:02:51.700> are
