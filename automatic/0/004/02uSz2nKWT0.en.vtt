00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.080 
teacher as opposed to an athlete so I
think<00:05:49.560> are<00:05:49.680> some<00:05:49.889> projects<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.700> what<00:05:50.849> we<00:05:50.940> have

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
think are some projects and what we have

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.180 
think are some projects and what we have
to<00:05:51.210> do<00:05:51.360> is<00:05:51.510> focus<00:05:51.690> on<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.470> athletes<00:05:53.070> have

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
to do is focus on that and athletes have

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.770 
to do is focus on that and athletes have
been<00:05:53.280> giving<00:05:53.700> back<00:05:53.880> but<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.210> problem<00:05:54.539> is<00:05:54.630> you

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
been giving back but the problem is you

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.270 
been giving back but the problem is you
focus<00:05:54.990> on<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.320> negativity<00:05:55.889> when<00:05:56.010> they<00:05:56.130> get

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
focus on the negativity when they get

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.250 
focus on the negativity when they get
duis<00:05:56.729> they're<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.479> trouble<00:05:57.690> instead<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.139> these

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
duis they're in trouble instead of these

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.930 
duis they're in trouble instead of these

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
time doing that but then you focus on

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:07.700 
time doing that but then you focus on
the<00:06:06.539> guys<00:06:06.690> who<00:06:06.870> got<00:06:07.020> pulled<00:06:07.289> over<00:06:07.410> and<00:06:07.620> in
