00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
cognitive even now the answers yes

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
cognitive even now the answers yes
really<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> few<00:01:27.390> different<00:01:28.320> reasons

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
really and for a few different reasons

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.319 
really and for a few different reasons
the<00:01:29.250> first<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.090> there's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the first one is that there's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.080 
the first one is that there's
automatically<00:01:31.110> fewer<00:01:31.650> calories<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> see

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
automatically fewer calories as you see

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
automatically fewer calories as you see
here<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> absorb<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.930> his<00:01:34.020> 34<00:01:34.500> calories<00:01:34.829> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
here to absorb with his 34 calories in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.390 
here to absorb with his 34 calories in
100<00:01:35.670> grams<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> broccoli<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.950> 219<00:01:37.950> calories

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
100 grams of broccoli and 219 calories

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
100 grams of broccoli and 219 calories
in<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> hundred<00:01:39.180> grams<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> chicken<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> mean

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in a hundred grams of chicken so I mean

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
in a hundred grams of chicken so I mean
that's<00:01:40.920> seven<00:01:41.549> times<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.909> much<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that's seven times as much as the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
that's seven times as much as the
broccoli<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.560> amount<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.250> food<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
broccoli for the same amount of food and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
broccoli for the same amount of food and
so<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> it's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
so just from that you see that it's
