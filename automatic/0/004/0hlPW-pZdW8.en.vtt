00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 Goodnight 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 welcome to the joaquin defense 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 coach coach lift when 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.270
 want from you first question that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.060
 There is the micro 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 I say good night before making a 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.900
 assessment of the game I would like that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 I value the opinion you have 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.560
 of not knowing if you can count on a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.550
 footballer or not until 78 minutes before 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.650
 the same 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 well we're not going to go into that kind of 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.800
 situations the club because what has 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 made a statement 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.790
 I know the statement logically and not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 let's go in what is true is 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.059
 that we are in high competition and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 well, we should have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.280
 answer much before but good not 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 let's go in there and good and value the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.070
 party where it has been a good penalty 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.380
 Well, no 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.750
 we have not been at the level we had 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.000
 to be above all in terms of true 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.650
 as to true in this case the betis 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.510
 I already had a certain arrival three times 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.800
 got three goals and therefore 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.390
 us when we have had the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.420
 options we have not gotten it and so 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.030
 there is so much equality so much equality 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.729
 that good because the parties that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 has unbalanced by that aspect the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.030
 success 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.380
 next question 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.780
 I wanted to ask for an opinion because good 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.299
 in the play of the goal of the draw of 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.100
 up there is a cedric entry that does not 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.840
 I know if it seems more or less red than the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.430
 that he saw last week dictated but 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.369
 well we are not going to enter I will not go 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.619
 I badly come to me now and justify 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.299
 the subject of the referee sure that in the end 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.610
 of the championship because to us 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.560
 will happen that kind of situations is true 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.470
 that we have a streak and about 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.750
 everything vÃ­ctor with the cards by which 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.220
 did here with the osasuna the other day was 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.050
 a little more doubtful but we are not going to 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.569
 enter I think it's not good we have 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.280
 that analyze being critical with us and 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.069
 prepare for the game there are few 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.330
 days to prepare the match that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.600
 we have against the grenade that is a 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.269
 difficult match complicated in remain 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.120
 seven games and seven finals and we have 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.760
 to go 88 because there are eight games left and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.069
 we have to go to fight all the points 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.690
 and every game thinking about the match of 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.390
 grenade at the end of the grenade and think 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.620
 in the next and improve in the errors 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.540
 that we have committed, not 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.420
 the theme is that joaquin be done 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.459
 too long the good season let's go 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.860
 to see us we do not think about it 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.000
 we do what we think is 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.250
 in the game of Monday's grenade 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.680
 it is true that we would like it to be 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.320
 out on Monday we would play if you hurry me 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 until Saturday against before because 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.060
 we have the possibility to take away the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.880
 bad taste in the mouth but well then we go 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.360
 to wait and we have to get the points 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.040
 you have to take 4 or 5 points and there are eight 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.450
 matches and therefore good we are 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.550
 aware of what we have to 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.070
 do it the teams squeeze there 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.130
 a lot of equality results that duggan 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.600
 Asen you lose at home then you win out and 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.160
 there we are seeing the results of the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.890
 teams 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.540
 mister in the change with an estimated if 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.430
 my mom had a yellow card to do the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.900
 change for gods by inconvenience or by 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.900
 a technical decision 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.950
 with the change of pedro lopez in which 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.079
 It was removed from the field 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.189
 offensive player like the Tsar was 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.689
 giving for good the tie at that time 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.519
 just when the betis had taken out 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.959
 I did not wander because we were playing 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.489
 change in our era two players of 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.430
 up we had played with two players 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.109
 what happens that we were already there 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.209
 we already the bands because the rhythm of 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.540
 not having competed so much the ville as 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.060
 pedro river as chuck as they are noticed in the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.680
 intensity with the desire for all that 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.120
 they went and well there we had to the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.379
 play with two players above 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.859
 we have to refresh a little the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.859
 midfield 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.669
 the boys are physically tired 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.220
 but mentally at the end of the season 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.979
 how they see us but not physically 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.509
 we are good the team is fine 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.650
 physically the other day against the 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.080
 espanyol with 10 footballer who 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.850
 we hold the last 10 12 minutes and the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.580
 team a feeling physically well 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.470
 the 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 mentally not those who give the discharge 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.470
 competition you have no choice but to 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.750
 to clench their fists in a defeat and 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.090
 think as I tell you in the next there's 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.680
 much equality and therefore good because 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.229
 we can not neglect 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.229
 I have one more plant, thank you very much
