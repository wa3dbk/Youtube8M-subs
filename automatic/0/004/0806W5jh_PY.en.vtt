00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
onkyo receiver um yeah so I worked fine

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.390 
onkyo receiver um yeah so I worked fine
until<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.779> got<00:00:27.020> no<00:00:27.259> sound<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.919> I<00:00:27.980> found<00:00:28.220> out

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
until I got no sound and I found out

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.269 
until I got no sound and I found out
that<00:00:28.550> it's<00:00:28.699> a<00:00:28.789> broken<00:00:29.150> HDMI<00:00:29.779> board<00:00:30.050> now<00:00:30.980> I've

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
that it's a broken HDMI board now I've

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.950 
that it's a broken HDMI board now I've
seen<00:00:31.550> that<00:00:31.759> on<00:00:32.059> kia<00:00:32.360> will<00:00:32.540> repair<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:34.059> free<00:00:35.059> one

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
seen that on kia will repair it free one

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.270 
seen that on kia will repair it free one
time<00:00:37.089> so<00:00:38.089> hopefully<00:00:38.870> mine<00:00:39.650> will<00:00:39.830> be<00:00:39.949> certified

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
time so hopefully mine will be certified

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.610 
time so hopefully mine will be certified
and<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:40.820> can<00:00:41.030> repair<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.750> for<00:00:41.780> free<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.320> that'd

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
and I can repair it for free and that'd

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.319 
and I can repair it for free and that'd
be<00:00:42.769> awesome

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
be awesome

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.310 
be awesome
so<00:00:44.329> let's<00:00:45.019> try<00:00:45.940> well<00:00:46.940> a<00:00:46.970> quick<00:00:47.570> effect<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.170> for

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
so let's try well a quick effect is for

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.689 
so let's try well a quick effect is for
this<00:00:48.470> set<00:00:48.710> but<00:00:48.860> doesn't<00:00:49.129> doesn't<00:00:49.339> last<00:00:49.550> very

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
this set but doesn't doesn't last very

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.779 
this set but doesn't doesn't last very
long<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:50.920> take<00:00:51.920> our<00:00:52.070> allergen<00:00:52.430> light<00:00:52.610> and

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
long so take our allergen light and

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.119 
long so take our allergen light and
place<00:00:53.000> on<00:00:53.210> top<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.629> DTS<00:00:54.110> chip<00:00:54.410> which<00:00:54.920> looks

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
place on top of the DTS chip which looks

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.439 
place on top of the DTS chip which looks
something<00:00:55.190> like<00:00:55.370> that<00:00:57.309> now<00:00:58.309> what<00:00:58.910> this<00:00:59.090> does

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
something like that now what this does

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.110 
something like that now what this does
that's<00:01:00.350> really<00:01:00.559> sure<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.309> chip<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.000> here

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
that's really sure the chip in here

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.259 
that's really sure the chip in here
overheats<00:01:02.690> very<00:01:03.019> easily<00:01:03.460> as<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.699> can<00:01:04.789> tell<00:01:04.940> it

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
overheats very easily as you can tell it

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.200 
overheats very easily as you can tell it
doesn't<00:01:05.449> have<00:01:05.600> heat<00:01:05.810> sink<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.060> kinda<00:01:08.060> stupid

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
doesn't have heat sink so kinda stupid

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.650 
doesn't have heat sink so kinda stupid
design<00:01:08.509> BBQ<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.970> rest<00:01:11.149> this<00:01:11.240> receiver<00:01:11.630> is

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
design BBQ but the rest this receiver is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.200 
design BBQ but the rest this receiver is
very<00:01:11.960> very<00:01:12.200> good<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.520> can't<00:01:13.759> blame<00:01:13.910> them<00:01:14.030> too

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
very very good so I can't blame them too

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.889 
very very good so I can't blame them too
much<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:15.710> what<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.520> chip<00:01:16.789> whoops<00:01:17.300> what<00:01:17.750> that

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
much but what that chip whoops what that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.859 
much but what that chip whoops what that
chip<00:01:18.080> does<00:01:18.320> right<00:01:18.860> there<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:20.450> feeds<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
chip does right there is that feeds the

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.260 
chip does right there is that feeds the
power<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.289> mean<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.619> little<00:01:25.369> preamp<00:01:25.819> chip<00:01:26.090> for

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
power I mean a little preamp chip for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.020 
power I mean a little preamp chip for
the<00:01:26.300> speaker's<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.709> that<00:01:28.190> needs<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.880> be

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the speaker's so that needs to be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the speaker's so that needs to be
repaired<00:01:29.509> now<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:33.080> should<00:01:33.229> get<00:01:33.410> nothing<00:01:33.500> yet

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
repaired now we should get nothing yet

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.749 
repaired now we should get nothing yet
yes<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.170> might<00:01:36.289> get<00:01:36.410> something<00:01:36.590> nope<00:01:37.069> we<00:01:37.610> got

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
yes you might get something nope we got

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.609 
yes you might get something nope we got
nothing<00:01:38.060> yet<00:01:38.239> seems<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.229> be<00:01:39.259> speaker

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
nothing yet seems to be speaker

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.010 
nothing yet seems to be speaker
indicators<00:01:40.039> are<00:01:40.130> off<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.060> turn<00:01:41.330> back<00:01:41.479> off<00:01:41.690> I

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
indicators are off so turn back off I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.930 
indicators are off so turn back off I
keep

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.770 

it<00:01:52.940> usually<00:01:53.120> takes<00:01:53.420> around<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:54.200> minute<00:01:54.470> or<00:01:55.250> so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
it usually takes around a minute or so

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.860 
it usually takes around a minute or so
um<00:01:59.590> forward<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.680> start<00:02:00.890> working

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
um forward to start working

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.000 
um forward to start working
sometimes<00:02:02.870> it<00:02:02.960> takes<00:02:03.050> last<00:02:03.410> penny<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:03.890> you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
sometimes it takes last penny if you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.150 
sometimes it takes last penny if you
were<00:02:04.220> using<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.550> receiver<00:02:04.880> recently<00:02:06.040> it's<00:02:07.040> time

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
were using a receiver recently it's time

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.100

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
to take some more two receivers like

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
up a look at some of the other chips on

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.729 
up a look at some of the other chips on
this<00:02:37.290> board<00:02:40.489> focus<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:42.530> there's<00:02:43.530> another

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
this board focus on it there's another

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.000 
this board focus on it there's another
one<00:02:44.069> right<00:02:44.099> there<00:02:45.469> here's<00:02:46.469> another<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:46.890> right

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
one right there here's another one right

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.000 
one right there here's another one right
here<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:49.230> one<00:02:49.290> has<00:02:49.590> an<00:02:49.709> ST<00:02:50.219> chip<00:02:52.010> there's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
here this one has an ST chip there's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.860 
here this one has an ST chip there's
more<00:02:53.310> those<00:02:53.879> almost<00:02:54.060> look<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.239> RAM<00:02:54.569> chips

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
more those almost look like RAM chips

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.580 
more those almost look like RAM chips
right<00:02:55.049> there<00:02:56.299> well<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.510> old<00:02:57.689> let's<00:02:58.349> try<00:02:58.530> it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
right there well this old let's try it
