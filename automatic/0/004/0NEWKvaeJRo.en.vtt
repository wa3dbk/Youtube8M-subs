00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450 

okay<00:00:00.120> so<00:00:00.269> we're<00:00:00.480> going<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.659> try<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.870> base<00:00:01.290> I

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.769 

did<00:00:05.460> peek<00:00:05.670> at<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.879> so<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.180> know<00:00:06.299> what<00:00:06.509> I'm<00:00:06.600> up

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
did peek at it so I know what I'm up

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.860 
did peek at it so I know what I'm up
against<00:00:07.319> it's<00:00:07.740> not<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.010> it's<00:00:08.760> not<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.480> good<00:00:09.690> base

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
against it's not a it's not a good base

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.940 
against it's not a it's not a good base
for<00:00:10.050> mortars<00:00:10.440> tell<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:12.590> two<00:00:13.590> reasons

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
for mortars tell you that two reasons

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.959 
for mortars tell you that two reasons
and<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> could<00:00:14.340> figure<00:00:14.460> out<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> two

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
and you could figure out what the two

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.269 
and you could figure out what the two
reasons<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.450> once<00:00:15.660> begin<00:00:15.929> there<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.010> good

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
reasons are once begin there it is good

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.560 
reasons are once begin there it is good
base<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.609> blitzing<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.539> reason

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
base for blitzing because of one reason

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.859 
base for blitzing because of one reason
and<00:00:18.990> you'll<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:20.150> what<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.359> once<00:00:21.689> i'm<00:00:21.840> in

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and you'll see what it is once i'm in

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.700 
and you'll see what it is once i'm in
there

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.249 

all<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.509> graphics<00:00:28.019> did<00:00:28.140> not

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
all right now the graphics did not

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.900 
all right now the graphics did not
render<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> arbiter<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.429> pretty<00:00:29.669> sure

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
render on the arbiter so I'm pretty sure

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.849 
render on the arbiter so I'm pretty sure
I<00:00:29.939> picked<00:00:30.239> the<00:00:30.300> right<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.509> but<00:00:31.439> I'd<00:00:31.589> only<00:00:31.710> have

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I picked the right one but I'd only have

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
I picked the right one but I'd only have
two<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.759> ones<00:00:33.090> defending<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> base<00:00:33.780> right

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
two so and ones defending the base right

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.740 
two so and ones defending the base right
now<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.379> odds<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.750> holy

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
now so odds are it's the right one holy

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.060 
now so odds are it's the right one holy
crap<00:00:37.079> i<00:00:37.110> went<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.440> wrong<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> wrong

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
crap i went on the wrong from the wrong

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.690 
crap i went on the wrong from the wrong
side

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 

I<00:00:41.790> thought<00:00:42.330> I<00:00:42.360> told<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.810> scouted<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> base

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
I thought I told you I scouted the base

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.460 
I thought I told you I scouted the base
I<00:00:44.270> did<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.450> looked<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.810> guns<00:00:45.990> I<00:00:46.170> didn't<00:00:46.410> look

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
I did I looked at the guns I didn't look

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.020 
I did I looked at the guns I didn't look
at<00:00:46.650> what<00:00:46.740> the<00:00:46.830> entrance<00:00:47.130> was

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.050 

so<00:00:50.660> let's<00:00:51.050> try<00:00:51.260> this<00:00:51.320> again

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.390 

is<00:00:55.150> one<00:00:56.020> Goliath<00:00:56.620> that's<00:00:56.800> nothing<00:00:57.100> but<00:00:57.220> hail

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
is one Goliath that's nothing but hail

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.510 
is one Goliath that's nothing but hail
storm<00:00:58.680> which<00:00:59.680> pretty<00:00:59.950> much<00:01:00.040> will<00:01:00.340> nullify

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
storm which pretty much will nullify

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.570 
storm which pretty much will nullify
siege<00:01:01.240> motors<00:01:01.860> because<00:01:02.860> hailstorm<00:01:03.280> doesn't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
siege motors because hailstorm doesn't

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
siege motors because hailstorm doesn't
work<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.850> way<00:01:03.880> on<00:01:04.440> bombard<00:01:05.440> do

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.230 

it<00:01:11.340> looks<00:01:11.609> like<00:01:11.670> missiles<00:01:12.320> motors<00:01:13.820> not<00:01:14.820> real

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it looks like missiles motors not real

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:26.970 
it looks like missiles motors not real
point<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.600> having<00:01:15.719> motors

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.580 

farmall<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:28.060> their<00:01:28.780> mall<00:01:29.020> situated

farmall in their mall situated

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:44.430 
farmall in their mall situated
just<00:01:32.100> pull<00:01:32.369> everybody<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:32.850> here

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.820 

this<00:01:44.980> one<00:01:45.370> pitch<00:01:45.550> right<00:01:45.760> here

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.220 

look<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:54.000> now

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
look right now

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.960 
look right now
kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.950> suck<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.250> knowing<00:01:56.550> when<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> pinch

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
kind of suck at knowing when to pinch

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.700 
kind of suck at knowing when to pinch
something

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.050 

that<00:02:03.220> looks<00:02:03.370> like<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.640> actually<00:02:03.940> be<00:02:04.030> a

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
that looks like that actually be a

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.500 
that looks like that actually be a
pretty<00:02:04.120> good<00:02:04.420> pinch

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.980 

I<00:02:07.570> am<00:02:08.229> not<00:02:08.410> seeing<00:02:08.619> any<00:02:08.800> gunfire<00:02:09.750> all<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
I am not seeing any gunfire all the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.510 
I am not seeing any gunfire all the
graphics<00:02:11.230> sometimes<00:02:11.740> I<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.040> don't<00:02:12.160> load

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
graphics sometimes I just don't load

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:22.300 
graphics sometimes I just don't load
right

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.800 

you<00:02:22.700> pretty<00:02:22.910> much<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.180> going<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> breeze<00:02:23.599> by

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
you pretty much this going to breeze by

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.230 
you pretty much this going to breeze by
all<00:02:23.930> these<00:02:24.080> because<00:02:24.489> come<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:25.700> keep<00:02:26.300> moving<00:02:26.450> on

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.450 

I<00:02:29.300> took<00:02:29.840> off<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.620> put<00:02:30.770> on<00:02:30.890> compound<00:02:31.280> x

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
I took off the a and put on compound x

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.190 
I took off the a and put on compound x
because<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.910> rates<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.450> haven't<00:02:32.990> actually

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
because of the rates I haven't actually

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:44.340 
because of the rates I haven't actually
ever<00:02:33.560> fixed<00:02:33.890> them<00:02:33.980> back<00:02:34.190> yet

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.010 

this<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:44.950> still<00:02:45.130> fired<00:02:45.450> still<00:02:46.450> turn<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.870> so

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
this is still fired still turn on so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:03:13.110 
this is still fired still turn on so
it's<00:02:47.140> probably<00:02:47.290> still<00:02:47.500> firing

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.300 

so<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.019> turn<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.349> guy<00:03:14.530> around<00:03:14.830> felt

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
so we can turn this guy around felt

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.610 
so we can turn this guy around felt
killing<00:03:15.790> everybody

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:40.710 

sometimes<00:03:21.400> firing<00:03:21.819> at<00:03:21.909> me

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.740 

no<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.680> got<00:03:42.070> in<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.190> back<00:03:42.570> probably<00:03:43.570> going<00:03:43.690> to

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
no I got in the back probably going to

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.940 
no I got in the back probably going to
walk<00:03:43.870> away<00:03:44.020> with<00:03:44.200> five<00:03:44.380> hundred<00:03:44.680> percent

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
walk away with five hundred percent

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.860 
walk away with five hundred percent
still<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.290> for<00:03:47.650> having<00:03:47.860> compound<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.460> not

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
still so for having compound and not

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.480 
still so for having compound and not
yeah<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.110> haven't<00:03:50.410> compound<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.860> not<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.130> is
