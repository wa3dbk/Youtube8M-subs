00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.859
 as well as ourselves always 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.690
 little children who will not play, they went to 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.340
 throw yourself back and wait for them not to be 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.169
 thrashed to give you the least amount 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.610
 of goals we went to go out to 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.370
 look for the result then we went to 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.120
 win not ideally would have been had 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.290
 from party with non-personal 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.580
 among which sanz I am demanding and 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.800
 I am very happy I did not stay because 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.320
 I would have liked to celebrate going out 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.950
 won not but the result was 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.950
 important 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.360
 so we were getting that 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.430
 was to get the goal that was not easy 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.490
 for us to face front 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.000
 equipment like the manouche and the damage here 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.370
 I have both teams of tumbes this is not 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.560
 It was not easy after long journeys 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 that I wanted to ask the time force 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.340
 hardest of the year 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.780
 and bringing the most difficult team of 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.379
 remove 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.629
 We first elected harder for 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.629
 the people was this team's May 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500
 we won 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 Cajamarca for 330 and we also lost 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 in its place also by I bring the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.470
 difference is then easy game no 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 it was because we had to play a third 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.240
 match but we have to play in 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.729
 trujillo we won him 1 0 2 1 with a lot 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.799
 more games and we are losing say 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.690
 we were still let me draw and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.369
 We finished flipping the game was not 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.850
 they seem more difficult and the moment more 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.899
 hard was when there is the possibility 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.110
 that we were eliminated by a theme of 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.140
 players for whom not qualified 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.390
 are the requalified ones 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 clearly those two people was the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.140
 most difficult moment because I considered 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.940
 that the project that we had started 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.580
 in February and we had passed 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.440
 not pleasant moments also in your 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.909
 moment they got some guys that 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.740
 they had to leave the team but they 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.090
 we feel today is that they are still 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.479
 being part of the team and not here 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.479
 objective
