00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 internet search the name and there record the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.149
 program is much better because it always 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.149
 will have 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:32.040
 only the advanced 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 it's just that his problem is that it 's the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:41.400
 evaluation version is paid one month 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:47.240
 but if you can download compromise 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.240
 cool pick region full screen 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:59.240

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.000
 and audio and video 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 the videos will come out here and make save 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.810
 personnel saved in a folder that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:03:44.780
 you will install the program he already asks 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:03:47.200
 for you to do it since in these videos 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.200
 on here 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.470
 There you go down and then the last one is from here. 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:04.299
 with an oversight remember family here to 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.390
 you see personal record in making the 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.069
 recording is here at the moment is it 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.769
 it's also very good 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.479
 only he is a little heavier until the 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:20.310
 configurations are those that have option of 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:24.520
 and a camera that it also has 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:30.820
 that camera filming you can 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.630
 Firming also has many other things 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.300
 huh 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.260
 also have to look for the window you 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.260
 Do you want me to dilate? 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.169
 then it also saves directly on the videos 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.169
 also the same 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.070
 that 's just it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.970
 I was just teaching you, you always need 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.289
 a problem to record the program 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.979
 here but you have much more programs 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.630
 you are very good 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.860
