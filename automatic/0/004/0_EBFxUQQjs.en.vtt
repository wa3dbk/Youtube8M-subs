00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.749 
playthroughs I give sorcery 3 a
spellbinding<00:03:25.409> 7<00:03:25.859> out<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.129> 8

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:26.759 
spellbinding 7 out of 8

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.999 
spellbinding 7 out of 8
it<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.509> another<00:03:27.810> excellent<00:03:28.259> example<00:03:28.470> of

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.009 
it is another excellent example of

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.770 
it is another excellent example of
interactive<00:03:29.549> fiction<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:30.150> contemporary

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
interactive fiction and contemporary

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.719 
interactive fiction and contemporary
game<00:03:30.930> design<00:03:31.379> meaning<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.459> game

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
game design meaning that this game

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.460 
game design meaning that this game
certainly<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.449> no<00:03:33.629> different<00:03:34.049> compared<00:03:34.409> to

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
certainly is no different compared to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.599 
certainly is no different compared to
the<00:03:34.560> first<00:03:34.799> two<00:03:34.979> games<00:03:35.129> in<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.340> series

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
the first two games in the series

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.240 
the first two games in the series
although<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.449> feels<00:03:36.720> even<00:03:36.989> bigger<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.680> highly

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
although it feels even bigger I highly

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.530 
although it feels even bigger I highly
recommend<00:03:38.639> playing<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.000> first<00:03:39.239> two<00:03:39.359> games

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
recommend playing the first two games

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.140 
recommend playing the first two games
before<00:03:39.959> jumping<00:03:40.169> into<00:03:40.409> this<00:03:40.620> new<00:03:40.829> title

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
before jumping into this new title

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.159 
before jumping into this new title
especially<00:03:42.150> considering<00:03:42.629> that<00:03:42.659> these<00:03:42.900> games

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
especially considering that these games

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.809 
especially considering that these games
feature<00:03:43.409> a<00:03:43.530> cloud<00:03:43.829> save<00:03:44.159> so<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.669> your

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
feature a cloud save so that your

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.729 
feature a cloud save so that your
actions<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.449> earlier<00:03:45.750> titles<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.290> affect<00:03:46.560> how

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
actions in earlier titles can affect how

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.369 
actions in earlier titles can affect how
you<00:03:46.799> play<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.280> new<00:03:47.519> game<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:48.229> personally<00:03:49.229> will

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
you play this new game I personally will

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.229 
you play this new game I personally will
be<00:03:49.470> playing<00:03:49.709> sorcery<00:03:50.099> 3<00:03:50.310> again<00:03:50.729> and<00:03:50.759> again

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
