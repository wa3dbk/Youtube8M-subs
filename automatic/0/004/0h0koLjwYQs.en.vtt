00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.870
 Yes 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 at 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.030
 do you feel for the 7th habsbourg 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.470
 as a feeling of disappointment or life 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.900
 after this defeat sends a big 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.150
 disappointment because we saw we had the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.790
 mission on the match we created 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.260
 interesting situations that we do not have 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.330
 of appraised for lack of realism 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.210
 perhaps even anticipation about 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.440
 adversary mistakes even if one is faced with 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.200
 we a guard who did two or three 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.280
 extraordinary judgments 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.240
 and then no but not arrive at 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.640
 to concretize our domination 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.590
 this is roy bennett tim unhappy at the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:24.340
 73rd but we can call it like tomorrow 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.110
 lack of realism wanted could 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.830
 win at least 2 2 0 at half time 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.800
 still 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.380
 still 2.3 bell tintin this stuff 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.880
 takes the same time yeah nan but nothing the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.870
 content as used before he 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.940
 was good but dominating is not winning 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.370
 a match is it south to win 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.870
 so from there if we gave the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.680
 cans of gas you have to put them in 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.910
 background not allow the opponent to of 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.870
 create an opportunity and bet on a 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.950
 corner and or a bad corner return 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.640
 and the girl and it's an attacking bolero 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.280
 but that's real hard realism 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.330
 over there but these drinks that's worth for 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.950
 a little sport everyone contribute then 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.440
 what is your feeling after this 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.450
 victory by four shows necessarily 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.900
 pleased with the result 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.299
 it was difficult match to macerate we have 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.400
 been an edict dangerous situation to 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.349
 each time our team has demonstrated 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.620
 defensive solidarity to be able to 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.480
 danger card the guardian also decisive 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.760
 as we also had two three 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.680
 counterattacking situations from 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.599
 fast forward projection we 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.160
 could have negotiated better by taking 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.079
 even putting in second 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.840
 and then after on a 4th hand here done 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.329
 penalty here is our striker not 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.920
 trembled and then after we did two 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.129
 wheels to bring back the four points 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.269
 so we are satisfied with the result after 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.109
 here I am happy for the players 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.850
 because it is 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.400
 it's already the reward of their work 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.010
 preparation yes because in first mi 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.750
 sochaux time still has two or three 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.880
 nice opportunities but of course in this 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.700
 moment at half time it was rhythm 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.320
 of the Sochaux team was 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.170
 relatively high says we had 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.550
 difficulties to come out lamballe on 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.950
 had difficulty keeping it 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.140
 so necessarily with social tags is 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.720
 in front of us a support we could well 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.420
 resisted and then with a lot 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.670
 of abnegation we could injections of no 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.340
 not take aim is on instruction 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.890
 in fact I repeat my now there is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.660
 hand at the referee be here fifa she has 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:37.690
 quoted that we smiled a long time 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.340
 by passing from its pivot to the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.040
 porsche influences puts the pressure of 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.380
 saint louis then president a president 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.030
 happy tonight 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.660
 a nicer gift than that he would not have 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.600
 could not do it 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.630
 I have just congratulated all 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.340
 group and for me it's my gift from 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:00.370
 returned to the position of president for life 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.580
 he could not do like sending this 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.510
 season it was aulas olaizola it's a 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.970
 very good question 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.430
 in the matches follow each other and 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.130
 look like that's fine but I think 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.130
 we will have other surprises my 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.090
 season is still long 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.620
 so next you will find 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.540

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:29.050

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:31.030
 julie hunting with good luck l1 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.660
