 [Music] 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.150
 Tell me guys, Lucas. I'm back with 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 another video for you guys for happiness 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.019
 youtube or maybe not 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 I already speak a little bit about English today. 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.320
 which is for me a mix in 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 American English with British English 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.189
 so I'll explain to fellow colleagues 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840
 some videos work here some videos 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.490
 and already talks a little about how it is 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.529
 the Australian accent but today I go 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 to exemplify for you some cases of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.220
 pronunciation that I think are more 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.869
 yelling 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.610
 just home from the video reference 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 whole is comparing with English 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 American, that's what we are 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.420
 accustomed to the language courses in the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.160
 Brazil, right? 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 the secret of Australian English that you 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.640
 it is said with much laziness nostalgia 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 about just to talk 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.289
 so the tip so you will see your 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.200
 derived this laziness first we 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.430
 Let's start with some variations on the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 pronunciation of vowels 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.879
 the Australian was in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 words and the sound becomes like 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 for example the word I gave in English 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.369
 American and Australian is said to give you 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.689
 I'll tell the team and on and on. 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 Another thing that can also 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.619
 to confuse the head a little is when 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:26.549
 they speak sound of English words 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:51.899
 American Just me how are you? 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:53.610
 lloyd we can not say a rule 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.750
 crepe and the person and depends on the word 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 also some people talk t 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.990
 I even consulted as it is said in English 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.700
 British or sound dr 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.799
 as is the tendency of American English 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.009
 then sometimes for example you can 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.459
 listen to the note itself 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.560
 baby and sells the rdc rules applies 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.730
 ending with r is as per 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.730
 american example 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.860
 [Music] 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.360
 not only at the end of words not in the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.099
 half a few words when it is 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.769
 followed by consonants you can count 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:39.280
 also seem strange but it happens 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:43.060
 so what would the American 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.170
 in australia he tattooed the same thing 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.690
 with the word jÃ´ 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.930
 for example here is that the words 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.110
 terminated ng forget to talk can 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.830
 cut into it for example what was goal 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.900
 and here it goes degree you can still see 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.630
 in many other words and many 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.310
 other crazy things but I think I've tasted 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.920
 today is enough I want to leave 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.959
 This short and useful video for you, I do not 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.690
 I want to do this a jones class is 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.060
 very far-fetched but I think it's the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.130
 enough for you to see training 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.109
 Autarcas fault of yours both liked it 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.880
 lifestyle and want more about 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.859
 Italian style about this poor 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.900
 talk you can leave in comments and 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.850
 asked to do more if you have any 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.290
 specific curiosity may ask 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.799
 me me I answer you walk by 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.540
 on here 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.210
 until the next cost 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.210
