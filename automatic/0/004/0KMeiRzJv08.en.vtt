there is difference in how quiet they
are<00:00:47.240> yeah<00:00:47.770> most<00:00:48.770> of<00:00:49.010> most<00:00:49.250> manufacturers

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
are yeah most of most manufacturers

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.320 
are yeah most of most manufacturers
retailers<00:00:51.650> have<00:00:52.070> something<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.910> generate

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
retailers have something to generate

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.170 
retailers have something to generate
noise<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.990> you<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.320> try<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.460> active<00:00:56.030> noise

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
noise that you can try the active noise

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.180 
noise that you can try the active noise
reduction<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.080> try<00:00:57.320> it<00:00:57.350> out<00:00:57.560> feel<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.070> way

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
reduction so try it out feel the way

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.130 
reduction so try it out feel the way
feel<00:00:58.490> the<00:00:58.610> comfort<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.300> then<00:00:59.480> presumably<00:00:59.930> you

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
feel the comfort and then presumably you

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.420 
feel the comfort and then presumably you
don't<00:01:00.350> know<00:01:00.410> these<00:01:00.530> projects<00:01:00.890> well<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.220> your

a<00:03:10.160> difference<00:03:10.519> isn't<00:03:10.639> yeah<00:03:11.299> but<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> mean<00:03:12.049> this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
a difference isn't yeah but I mean this

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.059

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
with the speed you just pull the

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.640 
with the speed you just pull the
throttle<00:03:18.760> back<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.359> make<00:03:20.200> yourself

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
throttle back and make yourself

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.270

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
we did a feature a long time back with a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.129 
we did a feature a long time back with a
chap<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.579> had<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.819> baron<00:03:25.420> 58<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.930> he<00:03:25.959> was

flying<00:03:26.379> it<00:03:26.650> from<00:03:27.159> the<00:03:27.280> back<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.579> his<00:03:27.670> house<00:03:27.879> and

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
flying it from the back of his house and

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.470 
flying it from the back of his house and
he<00:03:28.719> had<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.079> some<00:03:29.379> fairly<00:03:30.370> small<00:03:30.849> sort<00:03:31.420> of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
he had this some fairly small sort of

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.479 
he had this some fairly small sort of
field<00:03:32.139> which<00:03:32.500> he<00:03:32.620> was<00:03:32.739> flying<00:03:32.889> it<00:03:33.099> from<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.430> he

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
field which he was flying it from and he

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.160 
field which he was flying it from and he
would<00:03:33.609> take<00:03:33.790> off<00:03:34.060> by<00:03:34.329> pointing<00:03:34.780> towards<00:03:35.079> us

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
would take off by pointing towards us

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.129 
would take off by pointing towards us
this<00:03:35.680> multi-million<00:03:36.639> pound<00:03:36.819> house<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.900> he

this multi-million pound house and he

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.360 
this multi-million pound house and he
would<00:03:38.200> get<00:03:38.349> it<00:03:38.500> off<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.709> ground<00:03:38.859> each<00:03:39.099> time

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
would get it off the ground each time

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.369 
would get it off the ground each time
somehow<00:03:40.000> but<00:03:40.269> we<00:03:40.389> flew<00:03:40.629> out<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:41.019> one<00:03:41.169> of<00:03:41.260> these

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
also I notice about this is it that

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.950 
also I notice about this is it that
dashboard<00:04:38.349> is<00:04:38.740> very<00:04:39.190> high<00:04:39.550> but<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.599> you<00:04:40.720> see

well well on the taxi of course it's a

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.560 
well well on the taxi of course it's a
little<00:04:44.139> bit<00:04:44.520> different<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:45.970> when<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.419> think

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
little bit different but when you think

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.450 
little bit different but when you think
about<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.930> once<00:04:47.080> you're<00:04:47.229> in<00:04:47.349> flight<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:47.889> cruise
