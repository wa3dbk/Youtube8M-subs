manual which I did and then I went ahead

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.439 
manual which I did and then I went ahead
and<00:00:28.689> set<00:00:29.140> up<00:00:29.170> my<00:00:29.289> dx8<00:00:29.980> one<00:00:30.730> thing<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:31.060> did<00:00:31.240> right

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
and set up my dx8 one thing I did right

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.180 
and set up my dx8 one thing I did right
into<00:00:31.750> was<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:31.930> little<00:00:32.199> confusing<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:32.890> that<00:00:33.010> was

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
into was a little confusing and that was

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.670 
into was a little confusing and that was
the<00:00:33.370> switch<00:00:33.699> selection<00:00:34.390> setting<00:00:34.840> they<00:00:35.470> want

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the switch selection setting they want

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.259 
the switch selection setting they want
you<00:00:35.769> to<00:00:35.890> set<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.220> flight<00:00:36.460> mode<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.030> gear

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
you to set the flight mode to the gear

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.880 
you to set the flight mode to the gear
channel<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:37.870> it<00:00:37.960> wouldn't<00:00:38.290> let<00:00:38.350> me<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.769> was

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
channel and it wouldn't let me it was

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.100 
channel and it wouldn't let me it was
set<00:00:39.070> on<00:00:39.100> inhibit<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:39.790> couldn't<00:00:40.120> change<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.540> the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
set on inhibit I couldn't change it the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.930 
set on inhibit I couldn't change it the
reason<00:00:41.440> was<00:00:41.590> is<00:00:41.800> because<00:00:41.830> the<00:00:42.309> gear<00:00:42.670> was

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
reason was is because the gear was

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.479 
reason was is because the gear was
already<00:00:43.390> set<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.930> gear<00:00:44.170> channel<00:00:44.620> once<00:00:45.309> I

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
already set to the gear channel once I

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.520 
already set to the gear channel once I
set<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:45.850> gear<00:00:46.030> channel<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.570> inhibit<00:00:47.080> it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
set the gear channel to inhibit it

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.530 
set the gear channel to inhibit it
allowed<00:00:48.010> me<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.430> go<00:00:48.549> into<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:49.089> flight<00:00:49.299> mode

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
allowed me to go into the flight mode

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.660 
allowed me to go into the flight mode
and<00:00:49.780> set<00:00:49.989> it<00:00:50.110> for<00:00:50.320> gear<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:51.070> rest<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.489> set

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
and set it for gear the rest of the set

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.490 
and set it for gear the rest of the set
up<00:00:51.790> went<00:00:52.000> real<00:00:52.180> smoothly<00:00:52.540> if<00:00:53.170> you're<00:00:53.379> having

another<00:01:25.900> battery<00:01:26.320> on<00:01:26.500> charge<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:27.190> have<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.730> all

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
another battery on charge I have it all

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.820 
another battery on charge I have it all
ready<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.210> go<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:28.780> have<00:01:29.050> bound<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.740> the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
ready to go and I have bound it to the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.070 
ready to go and I have bound it to the
dxa<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:30.730> bound<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.330> down<00:01:31.540> here<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.930> basement

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
dxa I bound it down here in the basement

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.740 
dxa I bound it down here in the basement
so<00:01:32.500> I<00:01:32.530> didn't<00:01:32.830> get<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.950> GPS<00:01:33.490> link<00:01:33.820> but<00:01:34.060> let's<00:01:34.600> go

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
so I didn't get a GPS link but let's go

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.090 
so I didn't get a GPS link but let's go
ahead<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.960> take<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.320> outside<00:01:35.440> because<00:01:35.800> it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
ahead and take it outside because it's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.810 
ahead and take it outside because it's
ready<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.610> go<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:38.650> right<00:01:38.680> we're<00:01:39.220> all<00:01:39.400> ready<00:01:39.640> to
