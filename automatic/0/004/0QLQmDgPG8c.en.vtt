00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.780
 Artprice 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.610
 a very simple recipe 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.370
 we will use percent on board the aircraft which we have increases 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.579
 notables so the hand of miracles from the small net the chest part 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.549
 a poivrot most affected projects 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.749
 an eggplant that has been concocted in the oven for a short time 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:19.650
 salt 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.490
 walks 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.409
 and when a little bit more modest so we start 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.960
 by size mean 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 the thin slices of red peppers raging it was 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.820
 to crush for robert gibbs the goal of the game is to do something that is 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.400
 a little pity 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.650
 so I put in the product 6 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.150
 I do not have the pro, I stay with my father like aubergines and very bland 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 I will season once I put the eggplant 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.090
 I did not then 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 but small band of red peppers 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.160
 we will roll 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400
 but we smell of the product 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.670
 for the squeezing in his own chest 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.940
 I am going 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.150
 so for a little while 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.750
 I live 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 official undercooked so I tighten up but very very light 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 a drizzle of olive oil 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 again 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.030
 a little bit of gold seasoning 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.270
 Espelette pepper 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.250
 of guerande 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
 and we have they are addicted 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.540
 we bake the skin 170 180 meals that color they are cooked I'm going 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 undo the strings 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.460
 then 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 a base 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.780
 right 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 a base 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.590
 right 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 I understand quite simply 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.149
 and we will have his abductor 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.149
 more since 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.149
 at the junction between the two products 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:18.930
