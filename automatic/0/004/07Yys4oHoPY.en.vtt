get<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.150> very<00:01:26.390> similar<00:01:27.040> finish<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.190> this<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:29.390> we

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
get a very similar finish to this but we

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.530 
get a very similar finish to this but we
do<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.050> get<00:01:30.260> that<00:01:30.410> five<00:01:30.770> list

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
do that just to get that five list

back darkman I've had a little bit of
depth<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.310> base<00:01:38.080> then<00:01:39.080> finally<00:01:39.590> after

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
depth to the base then finally after

depth to the base then finally after
that<00:01:40.760> wash<00:01:40.970> dries<00:01:41.390> I'm<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:41.930> taking<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.500> little

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
that wash dries I'm just taking a little

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.680 
that wash dries I'm just taking a little
bit<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.130> peanut<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.880> my<00:01:44.000> brush<00:01:44.210> with<00:01:44.240> and

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
bit of peanut on my brush with and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.850 
bit of peanut on my brush with and
painting<00:01:45.530> up<00:01:45.740> some<00:01:46.040> total<00:01:46.700> stars<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.540> just<00:01:48.350> some

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
painting up some total stars I just some

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.130 
painting up some total stars I just some
little<00:01:50.320> hoss<00:01:51.320> shapes<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.180> also<00:01:53.180> these<00:01:53.540> days<00:01:53.840> I

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
little hoss shapes and also these days I

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.280 
little hoss shapes and also these days I
know<00:01:54.500> big<00:01:55.369> star<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:55.670> like<00:01:56.450> backgrounds<00:01:57.170> by

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
know big star like like backgrounds by

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.219 
know big star like like backgrounds by
dragging<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.950> little<00:01:57.979> bit<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.610> paint<00:01:59.479> up<00:01:59.720> across

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
dragging a little bit of paint up across

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.850 
dragging a little bit of paint up across
the<00:02:00.550> base<00:02:01.550> as<00:02:01.910> well<00:02:02.240> as<00:02:02.390> some<00:02:03.110> swirling

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the base as well as some swirling

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.430 
the base as well as some swirling
galaxies<00:02:04.790> by<00:02:04.940> just<00:02:05.540> moving<00:02:05.690> my<00:02:05.900> brush<00:02:06.200> into

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
galaxies by just moving my brush into

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.350 
galaxies by just moving my brush into
little<00:02:06.920> small<00:02:07.280> circles<00:02:07.700> around<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.030> best

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
little small circles around the best

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.090 
little small circles around the best
small<00:02:08.540> dot<00:02:08.840> would<00:02:09.380> be<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> center<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.070> galaxy

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
small dot would be a center of a galaxy

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.790 
small dot would be a center of a galaxy
so<00:02:10.910> there<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.570> really<00:02:12.230> quick<00:02:12.410> basis

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
so there you have it really quick basis

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.310 
so there you have it really quick basis
