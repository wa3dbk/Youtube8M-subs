00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello here is your sofia and the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 first look and today there is something new 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:15.949
 cooking recipes and that makes it today 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.570
 a tuna meatball and that 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 count on what's coming in exactly 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.939
 I want to have 100 here 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.310
 gram kidney beans kidney beans are 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.429
 really great for me, too, six grams 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.690
 protein 14 grams of carbohydrates orak values 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.730
 really good and fiber raw materials 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 and here with tuna is important that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 which is pressed out very well 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.750
 that is not allowed and hold 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 our subscribers frigate is not 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.510
 a dose 150 grams and fish you know 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.690
 friends has the highest of fish species 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.960
 Protein content is about 25 grams per 100 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.420
 So what better does not exist forever 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.059
 more species of fish and best that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.500
 The offered fishing is that with it if 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.120
 caught with these that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.130
 no dolphins can be there so 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.630
 and vegetables I have here now one 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.650
 scallion and a slip and then 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.409
 We have here a teaspoon 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 tomato paste and ten olives 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310
 cut a little bit about ten 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.210
 gram 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 and then we have fresh ones too 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.400
 prepared parsley and to flash 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.450
 I have salt pepper here now 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.159
 cayenne pepper with it a bit 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.509
 create and paprika powder and the whole 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.340
 keeps super cool together as we with 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.340
 the crush fork 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:55.290
 that's how accurate you can be really good 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.790
 we make it all now and now 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.180
 My hands are naturally fresh 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.610
 Washed sorry and I believe 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.370
 I can now run faster than simply 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.350
 a bit like this you can 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.980
 of course also chop small and up 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.980
 becomes there 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:38.590
 we would also be clever so that is 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:40.819
 paprika noble sweet salt because tuna fish 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.010
 I would not be so salted 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.310
 be much salt might do them 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.489
 after you finish trying that out 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.980
 Even enough, entertainment is pan 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.629
 preheated us to feel we 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.940
 bit of a home team 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.310
 the people ask yes where is something like that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.660
 There are shops where American 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.959
 corner is there too 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 I find practically little calories as 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.840
 therefore hot pan tightly for months 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.340
 pressed together you really can 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.340
 whole will tackle power 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.930
 we thought we were together 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.930
 without 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.540
 So a gap open 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.050
 change of perspective we are still adding 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.000
 the herbal quark and so you can 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.940
 simply the fat-reduced herbal quark 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.950
 variant from the supermarket is take 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.110
 Tastes great as a tip and there I have 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.610
 now here is a pack that is 100 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.350
 program has increased one more time 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.470
 your protein needs and I give that 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.180
 now just here to do that 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.690
 Tastes really delicious and it 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.490
 perfect when he was sitting as an evening meal 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.260
 her follow for the people who die 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.840
 Tuna fish can not eat so often 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.290
 because they eat tuna again so 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.350
 with olives just well seasoned with 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.720
 parsley onions is then whole 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.210
 other taste in there so I am 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.930
 especially because it's so fast 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.910
 going 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.060
 It does not take much time and 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.620
 The whole thing is totally delicious 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.360
