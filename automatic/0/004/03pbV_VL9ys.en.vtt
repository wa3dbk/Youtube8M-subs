okay<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.119> this<00:01:12.119> bed<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> planted<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.049> spinach

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
okay to this bed I planted some spinach

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.620 
okay to this bed I planted some spinach
and<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:15.150> couple<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.830> mr.<00:01:16.830> shim<00:01:17.009> did<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.150> spinach

and a couple of mr. shim did the spinach
doesn't<00:01:19.080> look<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.320> spinach<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.280> my

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

threw a few strawberries and the grill

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.500 
threw a few strawberries and the grill
grips<00:02:32.190> here<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.940> how<00:02:33.060> they<00:02:33.180> would<00:02:33.299> do<00:02:33.420> in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
grips here to see how they would do in

grips here to see how they would do in
the<00:02:33.599> rafts<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.170> first<00:02:37.410> batch<00:02:37.680> of

lettuce here in my little media bed is
doing<00:02:44.340> well<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:44.940> will<00:02:45.120> be<00:02:45.239> ready<00:02:45.450> for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
doing well and this will be ready for

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.680

transplant and in about a week or so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.630 
transplant and in about a week or so
that<00:02:48.690> will<00:02:48.810> fill<00:02:49.049> in<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.590> rest<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.280> system

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
2 inch grow grips see how well they do

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.080 
2 inch grow grips see how well they do
in<00:03:03.030> those<00:03:04.069> it's<00:03:05.069> always<00:03:05.310> funny<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.760> see<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
in those it's always funny to see the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.330 
in those it's always funny to see the
vents<00:03:06.360> open<00:03:06.480> on<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> nice<00:03:07.260> day<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.530> today<00:03:07.889> and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
vents open on a nice day like today and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.100 
vents open on a nice day like today and

doing a quick chemical check my nitrates

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.190 
doing a quick chemical check my nitrates
are<00:03:20.260> actually<00:03:20.620> about<00:03:20.800> 20<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:22.030> which<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:22.990> very

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
are actually about 20 and which is very

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.620 
are actually about 20 and which is very
high<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:24.250> system<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.880> almost<00:03:25.060> never<00:03:25.330> read

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
high for this system I almost never read

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.230 
high for this system I almost never read
anything<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:27.190> mainly<00:03:27.730> because<00:03:27.910> there's<00:03:28.120> no

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
anything just mainly because there's no

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.180 
anything just mainly because there's no
plants<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> system<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.200> suck<00:03:29.950> anything

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
plants in the system that suck anything

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.160 
plants in the system that suck anything
up<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:30.670> once<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.120> lettuce<00:03:31.420> takes<00:03:31.660> off<00:03:31.870> I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
up so once that lettuce takes off I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.340 
up so once that lettuce takes off I
should<00:03:32.230> drive<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.860> back<00:03:33.070> down<00:03:33.990> nitrites<00:03:34.990> I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
should drive that back down nitrites I

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.650 
should drive that back down nitrites I
there<00:03:36.340> always<00:03:36.520> reading<00:03:36.880> at<00:03:37.000> zero<00:03:37.270> doesn't

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
there always reading at zero doesn't

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.090 
there always reading at zero doesn't
matter<00:03:37.900> ammonia

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
matter ammonia

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.200 
matter ammonia
all<00:03:40.030> right<00:03:40.210> about<00:03:40.450> 0.25<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:42.190> fine<00:03:42.670> for<00:03:43.000> this

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
all right about 0.25 just fine for this

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.230 
all right about 0.25 just fine for this
and<00:03:43.660> my<00:03:45.030> pH<00:03:46.030> I'm<00:03:46.600> at<00:03:46.780> about<00:03:47.250> I'll<00:03:48.250> point<00:03:48.460> six

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
and my pH I'm at about I'll point six

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.850 
and my pH I'm at about I'll point six
point<00:03:49.480> six<00:03:49.720> six<00:03:49.870> twenty-eight<00:03:50.260> someone<00:03:50.680> there

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
point six six twenty-eight someone there

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.100 
point six six twenty-eight someone there
so<00:03:51.220> I'm<00:03:51.370> happy<00:03:51.610> with<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.880> too<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:52.660> overall

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
so I'm happy with that too so overall

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.750 
so I'm happy with that too so overall
chemical<00:03:53.620> readings<00:03:54.100> are<00:03:54.250> looking<00:03:54.490> good<00:03:54.580> with

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
chemical readings are looking good with

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.020 
chemical readings are looking good with
this<00:03:54.910> system<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:57.070> there<00:03:57.460> you<00:03:57.550> have<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.730> real

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
this system so there you have it real

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.730 
this system so there you have it real
quick<00:03:58.210> update<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.750> we<00:03:59.320> should<00:03:59.500> be<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.680> good

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
quick update and we should be in good

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.950 
quick update and we should be in good
shape<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.340> another<00:04:00.610> month<00:04:00.850> or<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.030> we'll<00:04:01.750> be<00:04:01.840> up

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
shape in another month or so we'll be up

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.080 
shape in another month or so we'll be up
and<00:04:02.080> running<00:04:02.730> waiting<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:03.850> get<00:04:03.940> some
