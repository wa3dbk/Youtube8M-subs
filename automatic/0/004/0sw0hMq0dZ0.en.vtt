00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.120 

you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.809 
now I'm going to add some short little
twig<00:02:26.120> branches<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:27.650> some<00:02:28.099> buds<00:02:28.340> are<00:02:28.610> going

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
twig branches that some buds are going

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.480 
twig branches that some buds are going
to<00:02:28.940> be<00:02:29.090> growing<00:02:29.330> off

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
to be growing off

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.640 
to be growing off
okay<00:02:32.420> now<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.930> we've<00:02:33.050> got<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.410> done<00:02:33.620> let's

okay now that we've got this done let's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.100 
okay now that we've got this done let's
let<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.280> dry<00:02:34.610> for<00:02:34.640> ten<00:02:35.060> or<00:02:35.090> fifteen<00:02:35.630> minutes

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
let that dry for ten or fifteen minutes

let that dry for ten or fifteen minutes
it<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.130> dry<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.400> we're<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.910> start<00:02:38.150> adding

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
it is dry so we're going to start adding

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.970 
it is dry so we're going to start adding
some<00:02:38.690> blossoms<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:40.730> fun<00:02:40.910> part

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
some blossoms this is really fun part

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.860 
some blossoms this is really fun part
okay<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.400> we<00:02:46.400> don't<00:02:46.520> want<00:02:46.730> every<00:02:47.300> petal<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.890> be

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
okay so we don't want every petal to be

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.300 
okay so we don't want every petal to be
uniform<00:02:52.510> because<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:54.590> as<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.190> would

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
uniform because just as if you would
