00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi how about here the gamer tacos 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.359
 commenting and I wanted to give them a good 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.269
 advice to those who are starting 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.219
 again what is the sea or beauty 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 alliance good I already have 10 already I have 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 first time of what I recommend 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.000
 buy is war machine so it is 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 war machine by the function of that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 in the special mission of machine 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.420
 war 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 you can get the weapon that will help you 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.920
 after a long time to achieve 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.470
 beat them mastercard no longer if you get 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.290
 the lover in each tournament 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.140
 this little weapon makes you get the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.970
 commit suicide after four very 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.100
 little experience if enough from the 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.340
 principle and do the technique of not uploading 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.860
 almost levels easily after the level 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.030
 100 120 will have almost all 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.590
 heroes costumes and good with that is it 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 remain at that level they will achieve 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.320
 keep 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.550
 securing a place in the tournament 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.390
 adamantium 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.130
 and reach of that of that silver paper 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.240
 aluminum that makes you so much 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.320
 problem with this strategy playing 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.040
 they just are not going to go up that much 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.650
 level they will get tournaments and winning 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.460
 those tournaments are going to get many 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.830
 heroes and will give them an advantage first 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.799
 and good as you will see that is the story of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.750
 the screws in this almost came to top 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.780
 10 in fact you who was the school by 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.970
 that would have come easily here already 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.760
 do not battle now, nothing else 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.160
 to the lover or adamantio in that tournament almost 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.210
 it does not happen just start playing like 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.990
 you will see they have started from evil evil we have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.320
 charged a bit and happens to be in league 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.890
 Diamond 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.990
 and before I think it was in gold and silver 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 and now they will simply see almost everything else 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.850
 of 2000 classification here in the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.220
 tournament 500 battles yes yes I will say nothing 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.150
 be submissive and things like that but 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.590
 really this game is to play the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.209
 Last day you can not have it playing 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.490
 20 days before the tournament dries because 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.100
 you will not see you will see that they will work 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.360
 a lot of classification and you'll get to the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.750
 gold league spend two fights 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.460
 and collections services fights what play 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.650
 of our ally because before you could 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.770
 charge mullings that give many fights and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.930
 with those pelas you can play and play and 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.520
 until you get angry about jc jota but 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:51.420
 now even hackers measure this already 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.020
 I do not know, they do not defend very well 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.670
 but they play too much to be top 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.510
 10 and top 10 removing what is 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.569
 jc j 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.459
 doubles that you are seeing here is pure 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.340
 jack jack or mastercard is no longer 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.280
 even has a name of topco care that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.090
 the truth for your attacks are not super 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.430
 mastercard no longer or hacker that this one 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.860
 had to fight the tournament past a lot 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.209
 times and I want to tell you I think it has 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.939
 like 10 heroes and it's 20 heroes see the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.760
 attacks that have played games give for 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.909
 give yourself to stay in a good position 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.620
 but it really does not stay like this all the 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.710
 tournament will be chosen fights 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.640
 and good 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.980
 the extra luck in the tournament starting 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.100
 this is my strategy, not strategy 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.480
 defending 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.800
 Y 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.560
