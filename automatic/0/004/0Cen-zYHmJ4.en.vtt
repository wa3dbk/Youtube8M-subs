00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this map now one thing I've noticed is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.100 
this map now one thing I've noticed is
that<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> playing<00:01:18.420> team<00:01:18.689> deathmatch

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that if you playing team deathmatch

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
that if you playing team deathmatch
which<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> hold<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:20.939> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
which I was is if you hold down this

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
which I was is if you hold down this
certain<00:01:21.630> part<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> map<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:22.770> it's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
certain part of the map I think it's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.690 
certain part of the map I think it's
towards<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.250> domination<00:01:26.250> side<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
towards the the the a domination side I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.429 
towards the the the a domination side I
think<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.150> around<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> area<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.259> all

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
think it's around the area then they all

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.469 
think it's around the area then they all
kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> spawn<00:01:29.100> around<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> yup

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
kind of spawn around you and you can yup

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
kind of spawn around you and you can yup
you've<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> cover<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
you've got like a lot of cover that you
can<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.130> covered<00:01:32.400> by<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.240> basically<00:01:33.420> run

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
can be covered by you can basically run

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.120 
can be covered by you can basically run
up<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> hills<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.680> down<00:01:34.829> onto

up the hills you can look down onto

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
up the hills you can look down onto
multiple<00:01:35.369> different<00:01:35.880> spawns<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> what

you're going to notice is that I was bc
around<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.509> part<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.259> them<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.439> i<00:01:40.530> was

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
around the same part of them up i was

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.050 
around the same part of them up i was
holding<00:01:40.829> down<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> same<00:01:41.369> part<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.880> for

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
holding down the same part them out for

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
holding down the same part them out for
pretty<00:01:42.329> much<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.840> whole<00:01:43.170> game<00:01:43.619> play<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.979> know

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
pretty much the whole game play you know

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
pretty much the whole game play you know
because<00:01:44.520> after<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.270> you're<00:01:45.630> moving

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
able to look down on people is a lot

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.860 
able to look down on people is a lot
better<00:03:13.530> than<00:03:13.830> being<00:03:13.980> able<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.760> attempt<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.660> be

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
better than being able to attempt to be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.180 
better than being able to attempt to be
looking<00:03:16.170> up<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.440> people<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.769> my<00:03:16.920> opinion

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
looking up at people in my opinion

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.830 
looking up at people in my opinion
because<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.790> know<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.180> you're<00:03:18.359> looking<00:03:18.510> down

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
because you know if you're looking down

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.240 
because you know if you're looking down
on<00:03:19.019> them<00:03:19.109> then<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.680> chances<00:03:19.950> are<00:03:20.070> you're

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
on them then the chances are you're

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.770 
on them then the chances are you're
going<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.579> them<00:03:20.760> before<00:03:20.910> before<00:03:21.450> they<00:03:21.720> see

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
going to see them before before they see

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
going to see them before before they see
you<00:03:22.140> which<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.350> what<00:03:22.650> I've<00:03:22.829> I've<00:03:23.519> always<00:03:23.670> found

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
you which is what I've I've always found

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.699 
you which is what I've I've always found
helps<00:03:24.480> out<00:03:24.630> how<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.079> me<00:03:25.230> out<00:03:25.350> when<00:03:25.470> I'm<00:03:25.530> going

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
go for my upset and chemist Reich's but

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.680 
go for my upset and chemist Reich's but
so<00:03:28.440> yeah<00:03:28.560> there's<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.370> little<00:03:30.000> little<00:03:30.420> tip

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
so yeah there's just a little little tip

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.780 
so yeah there's just a little little tip

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
for you that it may help you I may not

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.759 
for you that it may help you I may not
but<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.570> really<00:03:33.959> comes<00:03:34.230> down<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.440> map

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
but it really comes down to map

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.140 
but it really comes down to map
awareness<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.579> know<00:03:35.700> if<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.970> know

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
awareness is that you know if you know

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.400 
awareness is that you know if you know
your<00:03:36.359> surroundings<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.260> where

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
your surroundings if you know where

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.750 
your surroundings if you know where
people<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.829> come<00:03:37.980> from<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.730> know

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
people going to come from if you know

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.580 
people going to come from if you know
what<00:03:39.030> gunfights<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.690> challenge<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.109> witch<00:03:40.260> not

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
what gunfights to challenge a witch not

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.199 
what gunfights to challenge a witch not
to<00:03:40.829> then<00:03:41.579> you're<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.850> be<00:03:41.940> you're<00:03:42.120> gonna

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
to then you're going to be you're gonna

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.479 
to then you're going to be you're gonna
be<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.420> lot<00:03:42.630> more<00:03:42.690> lucky<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> lot<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.100> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
be a lot more lucky and have a lot of a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.979 
be a lot more lucky and have a lot of a
much<00:03:44.880> better<00:03:45.090> chance<00:03:45.329> basically<00:03:45.810> I've

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
much better chance basically I've

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.630 
much better chance basically I've
actually<00:03:46.140> getting<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.829> chemist<00:03:47.220> Reich<00:03:47.400> but

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
actually getting the chemist Reich but

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.670 
actually getting the chemist Reich but
anyway<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.480> pretty<00:03:48.840> much<00:03:48.930> brings<00:03:49.170> us<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
anyway that pretty much brings us to the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.720 
anyway that pretty much brings us to the
end<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.920> video<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.160> didn't<00:03:50.400> call<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.640> in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
end of the video I didn't call it in

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.210 
end of the video I didn't call it in
straight<00:03:51.000> away<00:03:51.060> simply<00:03:51.570> because<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:52.260> didn't

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
straight away simply because I didn't

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.190 
straight away simply because I didn't
really<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.970> was<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.600> was<00:03:54.720> needed<00:03:55.140> i

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
really think it was it was needed i

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.420 
really think it was it was needed i
wanted<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.530> try<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.859> see<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.190> know<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
wanted to try and see you know the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.710 
wanted to try and see you know the
highest<00:03:56.760> gunstreak<00:03:56.910> i<00:03:57.209> could<00:03:57.329> go<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.480> at<00:03:57.660> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
highest gunstreak i could go on at the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.319 
highest gunstreak i could go on at the
minute<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.989> think<00:03:58.049> I'm<00:03:58.260> one<00:03:58.350> like<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.530> 28<00:03:59.160> or<00:03:59.400> 27<00:04:00.269> a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
minute I think I'm one like a 28 or 27 a

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.630 
minute I think I'm one like a 28 or 27 a
can't<00:04:00.540> quite<00:04:00.750> see<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.040> then<00:04:02.220> we<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.519> think

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
can't quite see and and then we I think

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.789 
can't quite see and and then we I think
we<00:04:02.850> we<00:04:03.510> call<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:03.930> before<00:04:04.049> we<00:04:04.290> die<00:04:04.470> actually

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
we we call it in before we die actually

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.880 
we we call it in before we die actually
so<00:04:05.120> yeah<00:04:06.120> anyway<00:04:06.480> thank<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.500> watching
