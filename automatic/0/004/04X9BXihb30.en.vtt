00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
would use is that I don't or can't make

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
would use is that I don't or can't make
my<00:00:45.539> own<00:00:45.660> original<00:00:45.809> content<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.070> no

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
and I hate being dismissed like that it
is<00:01:38.159> certainly<00:01:38.640> understandable<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.689> you'd

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
is certainly understandable that you'd

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
is certainly understandable that you'd
want<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.259> efforts<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.950> recognized<00:01:41.610> I'm

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
want your efforts to be recognized I'm

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
want your efforts to be recognized I'm
sure<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.659> most<00:01:42.780> everyone<00:01:43.380> wants<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> feel

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
sure that most everyone wants to feel

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
sure that most everyone wants to feel
their<00:01:44.189> accomplishments<00:01:45.060> mean<00:01:45.329> something<00:01:45.899> but

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
their accomplishments mean something but

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
their accomplishments mean something but
at<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> same<00:01:46.979> time<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:47.909> believe<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
at the same time I do believe that that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
at the same time I do believe that that
may<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.649> family<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.100> worried<00:01:50.640> about

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
may be what your family is worried about

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.910 
may be what your family is worried about
whenever<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.630> dismissing<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.619> do

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
whenever they are dismissing what you do

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.370 
whenever they are dismissing what you do
you<00:01:53.850> certainly<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.780> videos<00:01:55.110> as

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you certainly see your videos as

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.010 
you certainly see your videos as
worthwhile<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> meaningful<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.299> until<00:01:57.750> they

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
worthwhile and meaningful but until they

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
worthwhile and meaningful but until they
also<00:01:58.290> consider<00:01:58.950> those<00:01:59.189> videos<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.909> similar

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
also consider those videos in a similar

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
also consider those videos in a similar
light<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.680> sense<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.460> see

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
light I get the sense that they will see

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.969 
light I get the sense that they will see
it<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:02.939> idle<00:02:03.450> behavior<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.710> isn't

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it as idle behavior that really isn't

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.649 
it as idle behavior that really isn't
improving<00:02:05.520> upon<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.969> talents<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.600> the

improving upon your talents for the
future<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:08.039> won't<00:02:08.190> make<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> difference

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
future it really won't make a difference

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.760 
future it really won't make a difference
to<00:02:09.239> someone<00:02:09.690> else<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.319> accomplishing

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.869 
they
see<00:02:13.749> is<00:02:13.900> worthwhile<00:02:14.519> does<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:15.640> make<00:02:15.849> sense

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879

the<00:04:17.440> show<00:04:17.620> improved<00:04:17.979> drastically<00:04:18.219> between

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
the show improved drastically between

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.520 
the show improved drastically between
seasons<00:04:19.120> three<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.419> four<00:04:19.659> about<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:20.380> time

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
seasons three and four about the time

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.629 
seasons three and four about the time
when<00:04:20.650> ice<00:04:20.739> reviewers<00:04:21.099> started<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.430> grow<00:04:21.549> in

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
when ice reviewers started to grow in

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.300 
when ice reviewers started to grow in
popularity<00:04:22.029> I<00:04:22.590> personally<00:04:23.590> think<00:04:23.770> we<00:04:24.130> had<00:04:24.279> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
popularity I personally think we had a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.909 
popularity I personally think we had a
part<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.820> improvement<00:04:25.240> we<00:04:25.330> have<00:04:25.539> seen

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
part in the improvement we have seen

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.330 
part in the improvement we have seen
perhaps

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
perhaps

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.250 
perhaps
I'd<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.240> think<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.690> show<00:04:28.900> staff

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
I'd like to think that the show staff

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.350 
I'd like to think that the show staff
are<00:04:29.500> taking<00:04:30.130> notice<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.669> what<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.940> fandom

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
are taking notice of what the fandom

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.600 
are taking notice of what the fandom
creates<00:04:31.780> what<00:04:32.530> we've<00:04:32.710> enjoyed<00:04:33.190> about<00:04:33.490> the
