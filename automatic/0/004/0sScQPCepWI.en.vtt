those you know tactical blades on maybe
this<00:02:04.700> they're<00:02:05.209> kind<00:02:05.389> of<00:02:05.420> designed<00:02:05.719> this<00:02:05.869> kind

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
this they're kind of designed this kind

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.989 
this they're kind of designed this kind
of<00:02:06.109> military<00:02:06.319> purposes<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.549> uses<00:02:07.700> for

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
of military purposes it uses for

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.340 
of military purposes it uses for
fighting<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.840> would<00:02:08.990> be<00:02:09.319> a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
fighting this is this would be a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.199 
fighting this is this would be a
sharpened<00:02:09.860> pry<00:02:10.039> bar<00:02:10.310> break<00:02:10.520> basically<00:02:11.030> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
sharpened pry bar break basically I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.089 
sharpened pry bar break basically I
don't<00:02:11.630> think<00:02:11.840> we'll<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> same<00:02:12.380> problems

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
don't think we'll have the same problems

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.220 
don't think we'll have the same problems
that<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:13.280> had<00:02:13.459> before<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:14.510> reference<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
bidding it's nuts and the last one we

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.589 
bidding it's nuts and the last one we
have<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> rat<00:02:18.200> 7<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:19.099> Ontario<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.480> this

have is a rat 7 from Ontario now this

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.270 
have is a rat 7 from Ontario now this
one<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.020> smallest<00:02:21.349> knife<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> series

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
one is the smallest knife in the series

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.510 
one is the smallest knife in the series
but<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:23.710> want<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.770> kind<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.980> run<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.250> spectrum

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
but I want to kind of run the spectrum

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.130 
but I want to kind of run the spectrum
of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
is a dramatic difference in size I don't

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.610 
is a dramatic difference in size I don't

like<00:02:49.360> all<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.660> our<00:02:49.750> test<00:02:50.080> videos<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.709> like<00:02:50.830> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
like all of our test videos we like to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.190 
like all of our test videos we like to
try<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.130> make<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.520> consistent<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.030> possible

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
try to make it as consistent as possible

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.410 
try to make it as consistent as possible
so<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.400> piece<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.430> two<00:02:54.670> by<00:02:54.700> four<00:02:55.030> here<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.270> assist

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
so a piece of two by four here to assist

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.729 
so a piece of two by four here to assist
a<00:02:55.540> little<00:02:55.750> bit<00:02:55.870> bigger<00:02:56.080> than<00:02:56.200> two<00:02:56.380> by<00:02:56.500> four

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
a little bit bigger than two by four

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.620 
a little bit bigger than two by four
piece<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.010> scrap<00:02:57.310> wood<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.209> have<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> nice

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
piece of scrap wood so we have a nice

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.990 
piece of scrap wood so we have a nice
consistent<00:02:59.320> area<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.010> do<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.489> chop<00:03:00.700> test

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
consistent area to do the chop test

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.280 
consistent area to do the chop test
which<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.360> going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.630> first<00:03:01.840> part<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
which is going to the first part and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.610 
which is going to the first part and
also<00:03:03.160> will<00:03:03.820> count<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.420> number<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.810> shots<00:03:05.380> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
also will count the number of shots it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.800 
also will count the number of shots it
takes<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.550> we<00:03:06.670> get<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> little<00:03:07.060> uniform<00:03:07.600> thing

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
takes so we get a little uniform thing

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.720 
takes so we get a little uniform thing
so<00:03:08.080> just<00:03:08.320> going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.860> put<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.040> out<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.580> is

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
so just going to put it out that this is

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.310 
so just going to put it out that this is
kind<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.940> inherently<00:03:10.390> dangerous<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.989> guys<00:03:11.170> be

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
kind of inherently dangerous you guys be

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.630 
kind of inherently dangerous you guys be
careful<00:03:11.500> if<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.860> ever<00:03:11.950> testing<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:12.400> minds

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
probably a little bit better because if

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:23.770

its<00:04:10.260> weight<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.500> sickness

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.670 

let's<00:04:34.449> get<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.840> our<00:04:34.870> bed<00:04:35.500> curvy<00:04:35.800> canine

probably what I imagined a little bit
more<00:05:23.719> here<00:05:23.989> from<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.639> fire<00:05:25.639> strike<00:05:26.080> the

possible<00:05:32.629> the<00:05:33.469> k-bar<00:05:33.919> cutlass<00:05:35.739> might<00:05:36.739> have

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
possible the k-bar cutlass might have

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.769 
possible the k-bar cutlass might have
got<00:05:37.039> down<00:05:37.249> there<00:05:37.279> a<00:05:37.459> little<00:05:37.789> bit<00:05:38.059> deeper<00:05:38.569> a

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
got down there a little bit deeper a

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.249 
got down there a little bit deeper a
little<00:05:38.959> bit<00:05:39.259> more<00:05:40.059> focused<00:05:41.059> on<00:05:41.179> there<00:05:41.389> but

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
little bit more focused on there but

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.480 
little bit more focused on there but
these<00:05:42.349> are<00:05:42.499> the<00:05:42.559> this<00:05:42.979> is<00:05:43.069> the<00:05:43.159> first<00:05:43.369> time

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
these are the this is the first time

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.980 
these are the this is the first time
I've<00:05:43.610> used<00:05:43.759> both<00:05:44.029> blades<00:05:44.360> side<00:05:44.629> only<00:05:44.809> had

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
I've used both blades side only had

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.559 
I've used both blades side only had
establishing<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.889> muscle<00:05:46.219> memory<00:05:46.419> with<00:05:47.419> them

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
establishing the muscle memory with them

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.929 
establishing the muscle memory with them
but<00:05:47.659> they<00:05:47.719> both<00:05:47.929> did<00:05:48.169> very<00:05:48.199> well<00:05:48.789> the<00:05:49.789> one

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939 
but they both did very well the one

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.070 
but they both did very well the one
probably<00:05:50.209> the<00:05:50.300> k-bar<00:05:50.629> it<00:05:50.719> actually<00:05:50.959> almost

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
probably the k-bar it actually almost

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.600 
probably the k-bar it actually almost
got<00:05:51.289> in<00:05:51.379> there<00:05:51.499> so<00:05:51.709> well<00:05:51.949> that<00:05:52.129> I<00:05:52.159> had<00:05:52.249> problem

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
got in there so well that I had problem
