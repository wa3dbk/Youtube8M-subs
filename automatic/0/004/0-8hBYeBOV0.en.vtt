00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 today we are here again drone world 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.790
 with another good another flight test and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.030
 this time it will be with the chronic 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.280
 zinc x 9 a drone that as you know no 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.469
 It is a drone for neither inside nor outside 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.330
 those drones that we really do not know 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 what is a drone worth very, very, very 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 light are very different from hull to the hub 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.420
 zanetti to hubs an x 4 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.699
 This is a very light drone which 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.230
 we had to choose a good day in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.550
 the one that was not too windy because 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.830
 you already know that a drone so light with 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 so much wind would go good to know where 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.430
 so nothing, let's have a look and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 we are going to put on a dragonball 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 by the way as I was no longer 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.780
 forgetting and I call him Rafael Cruz 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.000
 welcome to the drone world we are going to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.129
 put the battery there and of course 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 we have here stash good good 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.910
 here we have seen that we have come 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.030
 with enough more batteries not only already 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.500
 of the sim but we have today 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.270
 seized the day of recording for 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 fly a few drones and they taught 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.020
 you are worth this one right now 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.219
 vote this drone has no button 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.109
 on as you know so 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.880
 first we have to understand the bug 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.340
 this control 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.530
 now 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.530
 we put this is a milestone 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.719
 there 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.719
 and now they will have to start 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.110
 you see that a sorry forgiven we're going to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.360
 disconnect normally the drones 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.220
 usually 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.410
 is normally synchronized 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
 drones you first have to turn on the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.760
 command is worth it and that burn it on fire in the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.340
 head let's take here the micro that 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.290
 it's leaving me you have that minor in the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.500
 head that first turns on the command 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.960
 and then it lights up good what's coming 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
 to be the drone that happens here and drones 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.979
 how good they are more fussy but 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.210
 well that 's important that I remember 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.090
 and it makes us look 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.580
 there we will take the micro for 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.640
 that everything is perfectly heard and we 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 let's put this drone to fly 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.940
 we will fly very far and because 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.150
 we're not going to see it, so we're not going to 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.860
 take off what 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.840
 it's a very stable drone right now 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.640
 even the wind is doing it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.900
 too much damage 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.540
 let's try to take it a little 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.330
 far not too much 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.770
 there we are flying it really 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.370
 really close, let's give it a 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.370
 little bit of cane 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.340
 I was flying in slow mode like 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.340
 I'm watching 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.689
 because the truth is that it gives a little 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.180
 afraid to fly him and he does not know where he is 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.180
 really because it is very small 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.540
 the trust the speed range 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.730
 It has is quite short 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.730
 I'm not forcing too much because 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.810
 it's not too good a range too 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.270
 is that it does not make much sense worth we go 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.890
 to bring it here here 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.410
 is fighting there is support you are 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.480
 costing there I've been I'm fine but 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.460
 the poor man was already staggering 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.700
 staggering the poor because already with the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.980
 little wind that there is barely you can already 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.540
 red you can already stay stable I do not know 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.770
 if he is living now right now 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.900
 let's put it in quick mode vale 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.730
 pressing three times right now should 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.550
 to be pretty quick I'm watching 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.540
 with the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.540
 with the previous virgin 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.580
 the raisin is that clear 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.750
 you have to be very careful about everything 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.580
 you are welcome 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.930
 especially outdoors because you are 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.640
 can go 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.410
 to know where 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.010
 and you have to remember that the range very 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.010
 broad so 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.130
 I'm seeing right now right now 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.860
 is flying in fast mode 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.860
 let's bring it here in quick mode 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.180
 let's bring it closer 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.859
 it and now we will go again 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.409
 straight line we are going to approach a 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.439
 second let's fly again online 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.969
 straight there for you to cast a 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.340
 look at this drone as it flies first in 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.900
 slow mode and in fast mode we know that 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.790
 This drone has three flight modes 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.079
 but we're going to focus on those 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.519
 two modes because I think the most 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.709
 interesting is the intermediate mode to 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.480
 end nobody uses it because good nor 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.920
 for you or for me the things of it 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.199
 they do not do well so nothing first the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.269
 slow way you are listening we have 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.919
 given to the left button of the trigger 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.509
 left swimming a little bit has sounded 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.210
 only one gib so nothing for 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.900
 go ahead let's talk about it not far away 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.289
 As you can see, it's pretty lentito, no, 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.330
 present nothing 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.810
 OK 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.310
 quite slow reacts pretty 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.620
 rations very very slowly because it does not 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.360
 can 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.100
 can not do too much we were 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.540
 doing right now to the maximum and now 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.550
 is going to put it in the mode 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.700
 in the fastest mode so let's go 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.850
 palante 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.560
 as you are seeing is good is a drone 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.560
 very, very fast 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.900
 and that reacts very fast practically 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.380
 You do as you are seeing right now 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.610
 does and ebro pretty good is a 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.970
 wonder a wonder for example 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.320
 let's do the cartwheels this 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.520
 does not know if it has looked good in the 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.139
 camera let's do it again 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.319
 the truth is that the truth is that 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.080
 great because if you realize not 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:26.370
 there are big problems to do it 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.370
 same in what order we do it 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.370
 and it stays practically in the air not 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.530
 it's not like other drones let's put it 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.970
 let's land it is not like other 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.770
 drones that the truth is that when he does 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.960
 the somersault almost seems like it closed 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.750
 to stamp against the ground so 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.490
 nothing guys we are going to pick up here already the 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.310
 drone and nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.410
 this video you already know a lesson like and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.190
 see you a new video here in the world 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.190
 drone chao
