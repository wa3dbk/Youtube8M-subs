 [Music] 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.690
 if I have to list you the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.290
 treatments that separate them in facial from 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.340
 to incorporate 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.110
 to list you I expect nutrients 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.480
 I start with almost the most known 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 treatment with botulinum toxin and I 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.400
 I say the commercial name because there 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.230
 many more types of toxins the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.930
 durability yes it is true that varies 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 the amounts vary 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.230
 [Music] 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.350
 and the area to work even go 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.320
 expanding in general terms third 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.300
 superior and today I understand that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.840
 it must be and remains a 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.330
 treatment that keeps us at bay 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 expression wrinkles we have not yet 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.800
 got another kind of treatment that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 have such a good result at short or medium 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.430
 term as the toxin treatment 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.510
 Botulinum for wrinkles 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.510
 we are talking 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.130
 the dangers that is necessarily 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.990
 let's say the first step for then a 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.630
 home treatment with a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.540
 continuity for the appearance of the skin and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.759
 that we keep aging at bay 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.119
 progressive collagen which is what 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.700
 will help us in general the word 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.159
 peeling for example the most known 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.240
 of the population because some of the most 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.390
 known from the most convention 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.400
 to some kind of legend 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.490
 in a part of the population because it 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.150
 has used certain treatments and 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.890
 peeling means peeling 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.540
 but the same as shooting means 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.769
 shoot and it does not shoot the same with a 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.110
 Shotgun shotgun with a 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.090
 submachine gun and with a cannon with which the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.700
 feeling exactly happens to us like I do not 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.400
 I do the same peeling with an acid from a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.349
 guy who knows neither I arrive nor I have the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.650
 same reach or I get the same 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.409
 result nor is this folio the same skin 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 with a product that knows my pretension 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.159
 in general it is always that we get to 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.670
 the layers where really our 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.360
 cells 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.000
 they are continually renovating 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.060
 and looking for that collagen that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.460
 are new and have good structure 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.160
 any we take care of the hair the nails and 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.470
 what is generated and manufactured 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.180
 we continually have to ensure that 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.390
 That's why I tell you about the need 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.490
 of a comprehensive treatment of a 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.190
 treatment that helps with nutrition 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.020
 with health with photoprotection and that 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.300
 improve in the structure of that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.130
 collagen and then in the recovery of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.790
 treatment volumes as we would enter 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.800
 in filling implants in general and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.750
 I always do it this way with products that 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.760
 they always win the product 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.100
 Absorbable we can not walk leaving 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.410
 the old product and having to put 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.220
 new products on top and that we go 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.050
 storing layers 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.890
 then we put a product that goes 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.150
 going that is the collagen that can be 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 public in the area that may be 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.670
 chronic that almost always looking for 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.860
 a good structure of a good mesh 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.660
 of collagen the plasma of one's own 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.880
 The patient's blood is drawn and 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.300
 they sow the skin with their own factor 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.090
 of tissue regeneration in the united 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.520
 of the ojera in the sunken the chin in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.440
 the jaw flange all over the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.420
 mandibular ridge of course in the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.180
 skin of the neck that is the corrections 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.490
 with more less concentration and more less 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.560
 number of certain implants of 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.270
 filling to correct volumes and from 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.510
 then to improve the structure of 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.489
 Collagen 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.110
 and then promptly to the best 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.180
 Corrections of some symmetry e 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.069
 even from birth I have my chin 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.530
 very small and I have to put that 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.959
 there, yes, in some cases it could 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.079
 be completed with the treatment 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.079
 surgical 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.970
 radiofrequency that all the sheets do not 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.680
 the intensity of the 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.080
 radio frequency and continuity and 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.920
 Application technique varies and I'm going to 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.910
 greatly improve the appearance of the skin 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.370
 after having done for example I 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.080
 some infiltration treatment does not 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.480
 I do well with collagen or with a 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.400
 plasma or with the product of re 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.050
 He strained muscle for me will 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.720
 fill in 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.580
 and a little more compacting that tissue and 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.550
 improve flaccidity and affection and 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.319
 vehiculizar some vitamins also 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.960
 for example with a machine 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.879
 virtual mesotherapy that does not surpass me 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.099
 has punctured I use it less because 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.800
 we are avoiding punctures that I 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:09.560
 make a little moradito that bothers me that 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.330
 it hurts me etc. we program 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.460
 some more session but the result to 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.300
 medium -term virtually what 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.300
 we can repair 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.090
 with that same machine I can apply 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.600
 as much vitamins as I can be 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.569
 applying co2 the co2 and the foundation of the 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.909
 co2 when he infiltrated a little bit 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.429
 It helps me depending on the amount of 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.860
 the area and the technique well for 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:38.469
 some localized fatty angles and that 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.149
 we would be doing it in incorporate or 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.789
 well in the treatment by putting less 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:45.209
 zone and doing it with another technique in the 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.209
 treatment
