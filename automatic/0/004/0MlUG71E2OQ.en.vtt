00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:39.060 

warm-up<00:00:13.800> using<00:00:14.800> major<00:00:15.010> scales

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.010 

so<00:00:40.070> what<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.280> did<00:00:40.400> has<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.240> mechanism<00:00:41.540> going

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
so what I did has that mechanism going

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.800 
so what I did has that mechanism going
from<00:00:42.200> F<00:00:42.320> sharp<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.620> G<00:00:42.740> sharp<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.360> G<00:00:44.570> sharp

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
from F sharp to G sharp and the G sharp

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.630 
from F sharp to G sharp and the G sharp
to<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:44.990> a<00:00:45.110> sharp<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.800> definitely<00:00:46.340> something

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
to the a sharp is definitely something

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.600 
to the a sharp is definitely something
that<00:00:47.200> you<00:00:48.200> know<00:00:48.350> needs<00:00:48.380> to<00:00:48.800> be<00:00:48.920> ironed<00:00:49.100> out<00:00:49.400> in

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
that you know needs to be ironed out in

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.280 
that you know needs to be ironed out in
terms<00:00:49.880> of<00:00:50.000> muscle<00:00:50.330> memory<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.810> that's

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
terms of muscle memory and that's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.780 
terms of muscle memory and that's
another<00:00:51.560> thing<00:00:51.650> I'll<00:00:51.890> do<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:52.280> I'll<00:00:52.430> break<00:00:52.640> the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
another thing I'll do is I'll break the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.970 
another thing I'll do is I'll break the
scale<00:00:53.030> down<00:00:53.240> between<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:54.230> know<00:00:54.380> any<00:00:54.740> two

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
scale down between you know any two

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:03.350 
scale down between you know any two
notes<00:00:55.220> in<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.490> scale

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.730 

I'm<00:01:04.350> trying<00:01:04.620> to<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.920> get

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.830 

you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.759> a<00:01:08.790> natural<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.720> I'm

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you know the a natural in there I'm

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
you know the a natural in there I'm
trying<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.229> G<00:01:10.500> sharp<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.979> sharp<00:01:11.220> cleanly<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
trying to go G sharp a sharp cleanly and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
trying to go G sharp a sharp cleanly and
I'm<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.780> using<00:01:12.990> abyss<00:01:13.409> fingering<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
I'm not using abyss fingering for the a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.200 
I'm not using abyss fingering for the a
sharp<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.970> using

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.270
