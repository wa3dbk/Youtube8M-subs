down out of there and then once you do

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
down out of there and then once you do
that<00:00:24.000> it'll<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.750> pull<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.019> through<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that it'll just pull out through the

front side where the cable goes in no

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.979 
front side where the cable goes in no
it's<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> best<00:00:32.219> detail<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it's not the best detail but that's the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's not the best detail but that's the
best<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.410> put<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.890> flip<00:00:35.160> camera<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.760> do

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
best is put a little flip camera can do

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.350 
best is put a little flip camera can do
in<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> close-up<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:38.370> runs<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:39.090> here

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

the bolts on each side of the tank on
the<00:00:50.789> shroud<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> pull<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> tank<00:00:52.440> up

out<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> plastics<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
out of the plastics because that way I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
out of the plastics because that way I
don't<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> mess<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.260> radiator

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
don't have to mess with my radiator

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.060 
don't have to mess with my radiator
radiator<00:00:56.010> braces<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.820> anything<00:00:57.829> when<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> get

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
radiator braces or anything when you get

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.349 
radiator braces or anything when you get
down<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.550> part<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:02.489> goes<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.120> elbow

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
down to this part it goes into an elbow

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
down to this part it goes into an elbow
like<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.409> then<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> elbows<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
like this and then the elbows got a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.170 
like this and then the elbows got a
little<00:01:05.939> plastic<00:01:06.180> screw<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.460> portion<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
little plastic screw in portion here the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
little plastic screw in portion here the
counter<00:01:09.570> clockwise<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.350> real<00:01:10.530> convenient<00:01:11.070> on

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
counter clockwise is real convenient on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.500 
counter clockwise is real convenient on
this<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> front<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this because it's on the front of the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
this because it's on the front of the
carburetor<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.580> take

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
carburetor to get to that you take

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:15.320 
carburetor to get to that you take
either

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
either

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
either
well<00:01:16.200> idea<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.799> needle<00:01:17.130> nose<00:01:17.280> pliers

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
well idea is I use needle nose pliers

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
well idea is I use needle nose pliers
and<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.750> stick<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and you stick them down on the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
and you stick them down on the
carburetor<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> part<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.180> goes

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
carburetor this is the part that it goes

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539 
carburetor this is the part that it goes
into<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.130> pry<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.430> back

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
into but you just kind of pry it back

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
into but you just kind of pry it back
you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.060> use<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> screwdriver<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:25.080> whatever

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you can use a screwdriver or whatever

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.300 
you can use a screwdriver or whatever
and<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.549> use<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> lever<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.100> put

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and just use it as a lever you just put

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
and just use it as a lever you just put
it<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.520> close<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> face<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it in close up to the face of the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
it in close up to the face of the
carburetor<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.560> scroll<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> remember<00:01:32.400> it's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
carburetor and scroll it remember it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.080 
carburetor and scroll it remember it's
plastic<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.390> brittle<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.110> hollow<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> be

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
plastic it's brittle it's hollow so be

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.270 
plastic it's brittle it's hollow so be
gentle<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.439> engage<00:01:37.619> these<00:01:38.009> little

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
gentle but you just engage these little

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
gentle but you just engage these little
teeth<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.970> unscrew<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> whole

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
teeth you unscrew it out and the whole

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.679 
teeth you unscrew it out and the whole
thing<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:40.770> pull<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.130> once<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> out

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
thing will pull out once you get it out
