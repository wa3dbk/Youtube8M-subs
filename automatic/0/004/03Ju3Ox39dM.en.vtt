one of the most respected teams in the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
one of the most respected teams in the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
community definitely and you know a lot

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
community definitely and you know a lot
of<00:01:55.560> their<00:01:55.770> players<00:01:55.799> were<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.729> loyal

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of their players were just really loyal

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.060 
and I guess that started to you know
sort<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> change<00:02:00.030> over<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the leaders started to get really

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
the leaders started to get really
frustrated<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.140> lot<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.409> people

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
frustrated with that a lot of people

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560
