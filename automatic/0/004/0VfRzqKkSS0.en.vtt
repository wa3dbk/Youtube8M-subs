00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
I'd like to do an outside check but

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.759 
I'd like to do an outside check but

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.470 
outside check testing the turn I do
horrible<00:02:33.500> flying<00:02:33.799> this<00:02:34.160> video<00:02:34.519> it's<00:02:35.200> scary

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
horrible flying this video it's scary

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.610 
horrible flying this video it's scary
very<00:02:38.480> scary<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:44.420> can<00:02:44.600> all<00:02:44.750> practice<00:02:45.049> it<00:02:45.410> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
very scary you can all practice it and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.340 
very scary you can all practice it and
this<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.580> not<00:02:46.760> realistic<00:02:47.030> enough<00:02:47.570> so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
this is so it's not realistic enough so

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.830 
this is so it's not realistic enough so
you<00:02:48.440> can<00:02:48.500> practice<00:02:48.799> stalls<00:02:49.400> look<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:53.209> just

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
you can practice stalls look that just

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:04.370 
you can practice stalls look that just
happens<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:56.440> probably<00:02:57.440> broke<00:02:57.859> the<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.820> yoke

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:16.420 

but<00:03:05.010> two<00:03:05.370> works

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.350 

ok

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.200 

so<00:03:22.200> now<00:03:22.350> I'm<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.710> going<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.220> landing<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
so now I'm not going for landing so it

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.740 
so now I'm not going for landing so it
was<00:03:24.420> ya<00:03:24.870> see<00:03:25.230> how<00:03:25.410> realistic<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.310> or<00:03:26.850> see

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
was ya see how realistic it is or see

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.390 
was ya see how realistic it is or see
how<00:03:27.870> not<00:03:28.620> realistic<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:31.850> kagu<00:03:32.850> space

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
how not realistic it is kagu space

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.570 
how not realistic it is kagu space

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.860 

also<00:04:36.560> never<00:04:37.560> always<00:04:38.070> rely<00:04:38.430> on<00:04:38.460> those<00:04:39.300> but<00:04:39.660> on

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
also never always rely on those but on

also never always rely on those but on
those<00:04:40.200> red<00:04:40.830> lights<00:04:41.630> never<00:04:42.630> always<00:04:43.470> rely<00:04:44.010> ok<00:04:44.610> if

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
those red lights never always rely ok if

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.450 
those red lights never always rely ok if
you<00:04:45.360> always<00:04:45.690> if<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.140> just<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:47.040> little<00:04:47.310> bit

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
you always if you just a little bit
