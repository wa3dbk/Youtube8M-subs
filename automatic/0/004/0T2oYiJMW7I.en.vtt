points oily if you grip the two sides

quite light labor enough around the

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.619 
quite light labor enough around the
friction<00:02:54.140> will<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.470> fly<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.730> little<00:02:56.239> cards

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
friction will just fly the little cards

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.899 
friction will just fly the little cards
opened<00:02:57.170> you'll<00:02:57.799> be<00:02:57.890> left<00:02:58.069> with<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.489> top<00:02:58.700> two

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
opened you'll be left with the top two

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.699 
opened you'll be left with the top two
cards<00:02:59.260> which<00:03:00.260> look<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.069> their<00:03:01.579> cards<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
cards which look like their cards on it

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.890 
cards which look like their cards on it
if<00:03:04.129> they<00:03:04.700> don't<00:03:04.879> work<00:03:05.060> closely<00:03:05.329> enough<00:03:05.540> it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
if they don't work closely enough it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.410 
if they don't work closely enough it
really<00:03:06.200> fills<00:03:06.470> them<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.549> i<00:03:07.579> think<00:03:07.940> that's<00:03:08.269> it

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
really fills them so i think that's it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.260 
really fills them so i think that's it
and<00:03:08.690> i'll<00:03:08.930> see<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.230> next
