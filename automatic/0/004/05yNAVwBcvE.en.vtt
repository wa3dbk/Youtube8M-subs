farm<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.120> son<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> grain<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
farm with my son we have a grain and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.950 
farm with my son we have a grain and
livestock<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.760> feed<00:00:38.969> cattle<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.570> small

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
livestock we feed cattle a small

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
livestock we feed cattle a small
operation<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> lot<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> manure<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.270> our

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

operation we have a lot of manure on our
ground<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> thought<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> would<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
ground and so we thought this would be a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.479 
ground and so we thought this would be a
good<00:00:44.280> place<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.410> research<00:00:46.410> also<00:00:47.340> with

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

vertical<00:01:53.210> tillage<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.040> first<00:01:55.280> we've

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
vertical tillage that is the first we've

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.359 
vertical tillage that is the first we've
used<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.509> year<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:56.960> then<00:01:57.619> we're

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
used that this year and then we're

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.160 
used that this year and then we're
probably<00:01:58.549> going<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:58.880> little<00:01:59.000> higher

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
probably going a little higher

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.010 
probably going a little higher
populations<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:02.030> far<00:02:02.270> that's<00:02:02.540> about<00:02:02.810> all

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
populations and so far that's about all

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.719 
populations and so far that's about all
we<00:02:03.200> have<00:02:03.229> done<00:02:03.530> different<00:02:04.070> is<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.250> different

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
we have done different is a different

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.420 
we have done different is a different
population<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.600> vertical<00:02:06.200> tillage<00:02:06.380> okay<00:02:06.830> so

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
population and vertical tillage okay so

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.050 
population and vertical tillage okay so
tell<00:02:08.090> me<00:02:08.119> about<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.479> process<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:09.110> choosing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
tell me about the process of choosing

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.580 
tell me about the process of choosing
seeding<00:02:11.060> rate<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.959> talked<00:02:12.200> about<00:02:12.380> using

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
seeding rate you talked about using

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.610

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
different populations if you worked with

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.260 
different populations if you worked with

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
been nice and warm but did you could see

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.039 
been nice and warm but did you could see
it<00:03:22.430> between<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.850> tile<00:03:23.090> lines<00:03:23.359> for<00:03:23.780> several

it between the tile lines for several
days<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.560> was<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:25.459> was<00:03:26.829> as<00:03:27.829> Joe<00:03:28.100> mentioned<00:03:28.280> you

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
days it was it was as Joe mentioned you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.539 
days it was it was as Joe mentioned you
know<00:03:29.209> we're<00:03:29.359> early<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.260> with<00:03:30.950> with<00:03:31.280> the

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
know we're early on here with with the

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.960 
know we're early on here with with the
the<00:03:32.030> project<00:03:32.239> here<00:03:32.750> but<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:34.370> know<00:03:34.459> we're

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the project here but you know we're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.539 
the project here but you know we're
pretty<00:03:35.959> far<00:03:36.170> behind<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.709> growing<00:03:36.950> degrees<00:03:37.370> I

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
pretty far behind on growing degrees I

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.520 
pretty far behind on growing degrees I
think<00:03:37.730> we're<00:03:37.880> at<00:03:37.940> about<00:03:38.420> 289<00:03:38.930> right<00:03:39.350> now

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
think we're at about 289 right now

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.560 
think we're at about 289 right now
versus<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.400> last<00:03:40.549> year<00:03:40.760> were<00:03:40.820> around<00:03:41.000> 440

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
versus I think last year were around 440

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.300 
versus I think last year were around 440
at<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.810> time<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:42.500> we're<00:03:42.590> about<00:03:42.680> 200<00:03:42.890> heat

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
at this time so we're about 200 heat

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.400 
at this time so we're about 200 heat
units<00:03:43.670> away<00:03:43.910> from<00:03:43.940> what<00:03:44.780> we<00:03:44.870> were<00:03:45.019> last<00:03:45.200> year

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
units away from what we were last year

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.740 
units away from what we were last year
so<00:03:45.680> we've<00:03:46.250> experienced<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:47.450> know<00:03:47.480> some

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
so we've experienced you know some

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.180 
so we've experienced you know some
struggles<00:03:48.140> here<00:03:48.290> earlier<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.980> Joe

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
struggles here earlier on as Joe

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.890 
struggles here earlier on as Joe
mentioned<00:03:49.400> with<00:03:49.670> rain<00:03:49.970> number<00:03:50.390> one

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
mentioned with rain number one

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.140 
mentioned with rain number one
but<00:03:51.349> our<00:03:51.470> biggest<00:03:51.650> issue<00:03:51.950> we've<00:03:52.189> had<00:03:52.370> was<00:03:52.640> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
but our biggest issue we've had was the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.429 
but our biggest issue we've had was the
cold<00:03:53.360> temps<00:03:53.629> we've<00:03:53.750> had<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.290> more

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
cold temps we've had and more

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.229 
cold temps we've had and more
particularly<00:03:54.829> at<00:03:55.069> night<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.519> those<00:03:55.970> cold

particularly at night and those cold

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.819 
particularly at night and those cold
temperatures<00:03:56.599> we've<00:03:56.780> had<00:03:56.959> at<00:03:57.079> night<00:03:57.260> so

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
temperatures we've had at night so

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.949 
temperatures we've had at night so
