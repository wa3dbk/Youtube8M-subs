00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
see this minecraft.jar folder file we're

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
see this minecraft.jar folder file we're
going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> turn<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> into<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.880> folder<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.960> we

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
going to turn it into a folder and we

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
going to turn it into a folder and we
can<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.530> by<00:01:37.650> simply<00:01:37.920> opening<00:01:38.600> with

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
can do that by simply opening with

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.760 
can do that by simply opening with
archive<00:01:40.590> utility<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.140> will<00:01:43.350> create<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
archive utility and it will create a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
archive utility and it will create a
folder<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.850> now<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> folder<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.720> can

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
folder so now we have that folder we can

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.880 
folder so now we have that folder we can
get<00:01:46.049> rid<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.560> dot<00:01:46.770> jar<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.649> going
