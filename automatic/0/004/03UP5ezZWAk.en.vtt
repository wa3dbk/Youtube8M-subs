Hi guys ! Welcome back to my channel !

00:00:02.137 --> 00:00:04.060
Today I have another nail art tutorial for you.

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.219
Its very cute fall nail art and very easy to do.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:10.276
As you can see it another dot manicure idea

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.680
by using different colors of dots you can get really cool results

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.804
I am also going to show you another variation of this manicure with  glitter nail polish.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:18.708
So lets get started !

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:26.631
I`ve already applied my base coat and now I am going to apply my white nail polish on all my nails except my pinky and my index finger

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:31.492
And for this I am using Sally Hansen extreme wear in shade 300 "white on".

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:42.527
For my index finger and my pinky I am gonna use my Rimmel Salon Pro nail polish in shade 394.

00:00:42.527 --> 00:00:44.182
Its color of dark red wine perfect  for fall.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:46.020
Now lets move on to the middle finger.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.642
I am going to take my dotting tool and deep it into my Rimmel nail polish I just paint on my pinky and index finger

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.294
I put my dots randomly

00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:58.693
At first I am using bigger size of dotting tool and then smaller

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:03.863
I am going to clean off my dotting tool and move on  to the next color.

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:09.179
Next color I am using is orange, reminds me of pumpkins and then green color .

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.061
As you can see I just put dots in between of other dots.

00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.211
I am using different sizes of dotting tool.

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:15.646
Because I want my dots to be various.

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:22.113
I also will add smaller red dots and then after I am done I will do the same steps with my other nails painted white.

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:44.275
Now I will apply star shaped rhinestones on my index finger and my pinky.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:47.857
You can choose any other shape of rhinestones you like.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.995
I think that star shaped rhinestones look really cute.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:58.731
After I am done with rhinestones, I will apply top coat on all my nails.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.980
Here is the finished look I just love the colors in this manicure

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.450
You can use different colored dots on all your nails.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.757
But I think its looks better with solid color and rhinestones on 2 other nails.

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:40.586
I hope you like this fall nail design. And now let me show you my second variation.

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:46.880
I will use nail polish remover pad and will remover nail polish and rhinestones from my pinky and index finger .

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.111
And then will apply Rimmel Nail polish in shade 394 one more time.

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:55.352
Next I will apply glitter nail polish. I could not decided which one to use

00:02:55.397 --> 00:03:00.277
then one from ELF or Sally Hansen and then I decided to go with Sally Hansen

00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:06.408
You can use glitter nail polish with bigger pieces and I would suggest to use gold or copper definitely not silver glitter nail polish.

00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:08.204
It will not look good with this color combination.

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:15.949
So if you don't have any rhinestones you can use glitter nail polish it will definitely work for this manicure (nail art design) .

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.823
I really like this final result

00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:34.896
This nail design is very simple to do and its perfect for Fall.

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.649

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:43.353
