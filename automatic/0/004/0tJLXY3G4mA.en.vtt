00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 you have a statement without giving a signal 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.320
 qantas also in the same 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.810

 manatt in united states norman forecast same month

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.829
 to many people 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.140
 as 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.589
 If you ask me if I feel good 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.490
 very spanish 0 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.990
 perry almost all my life in italy and also 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.350
 the northwest 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.830
 I 150% Spanish are detailed 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.830
 An example 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.830
 no idea the channel 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.280
 in the note I do not know if the Argentines have a style of play because in truth my 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.500
 team there was no Puerto Rican I know he he health area 2 0 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.970
 the two will be the owner 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.970
 we have a coach no nortel andes 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.940
 rosa dÃ­ez no they were not very nice of bermejo of puerto rico was my best year 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.219
 it was a very physical game a physical g mining 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 high balls for the front that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.270
 I was a vegetarian, it gives me a lot of touch 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 although we did have players who can do it but 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.980
 inside they do not grow 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.930
 the response of the fans in puerto rico tactics 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 fantastic border 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.950
 for them it's a party made of grass 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.430
 and in football because they were not used to it at the same time 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.430
 i especially second year that 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 we achieved the end of concachampions 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.820
 i that court 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.790
 of exploiting people was something 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.540
 something that tells me to stay but inside all my life because nobody 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.280
 I was expecting this in puerto rico 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.310
 we are very proud of what we achieved with the team and profane ticos we 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.730
 they always supported 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.650
 and appreciated despite the strong healthy weight of portfoil that started at 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.489
 I really liked it 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.820
 my first professional year 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.039
 It was at 11 11 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.299
 96 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.539
 min 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:21.769
 96 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.769
 14 years ago 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:30.400
 I started playing soccer on the street about three years since the 82 83 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.119
 four years like this 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.859
 if it was different in Italy in Italian the menem can not have attacked us 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.979
 to play 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:41.119
 let me go from house to house and that I hope in Spain the different 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.689
 in Spain after school they ate spirit of down 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.340
 play all day and there began my passion for paragraph atlas the 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.339
 difference between European football 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.539
 the latin motion 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.090
 Argentina 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.290
 there have been two in him for example Italian football 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:08.009
 Italians that is different from the other cultural ones because in Europe 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.079
 It is very tactical 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.279
 in its very 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.379
 the important thing is that they do not put you mor 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.739
 then moved it to satena will mark is only what they think about what 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 they try to do 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.309
 we are very good all that was phenomenal ee 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.980
 the people here not to write down 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.159
 from Carmen 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.159
 the court is full of 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.709
 the truth that was very exciting besides 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.889
 we 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.059
 when we feel the support to the heat of the people in 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:43.109
 We are another team, nobody wins when when we are like this 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.909
 i 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.090
 in an interview while we really found each other I loved when peter pan 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.829
