00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
is white because i'm going to airbrush

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.410 
is white because i'm going to airbrush
the<00:01:05.759> whole<00:01:05.970> thing<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.750> hide<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> cookie<00:01:08.910> area

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the whole thing to hide the cookie area

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.670 
the whole thing to hide the cookie area
the<00:01:09.660> part<00:01:09.899> that's<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.289> be<00:01:10.350> showing<00:01:10.500> on

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the part that's going to be showing on

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.430 
the part that's going to be showing on
the<00:01:10.770> edge<00:01:10.890> it'll<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.490> black<00:01:11.759> as<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.840> when

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
the edge it'll all be black as well when

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.289 
the edge it'll all be black as well when
you<00:01:13.590> color<00:01:13.830> fondant<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.640> color<00:01:14.850> icing

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you color fondant and you color icing

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
you color fondant and you color icing
you'll<00:01:15.420> never<00:01:15.630> achieve<00:01:15.780> exactly<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.590> same

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
you'll never achieve exactly the same

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.550 
you'll never achieve exactly the same
color<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.909> way<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> base<00:01:18.510> will<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.350> be

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
color so this way the base will all be

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
color so this way the base will all be
white<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.760> I<00:01:20.790> come<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.360> airbrush<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
white and when I come in and airbrush it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.010 
white and when I come in and airbrush it
it'll<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> much<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.189> uniform<00:01:23.820> color<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it'll make a much more uniform color and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
it'll make a much more uniform color and
so<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> later<00:01:26.159> I'm<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> decorate

simple just quickly I've got some pretty
stiff<00:02:18.790> icing<00:02:19.600> like<00:02:19.780> piping<00:02:20.230> consistency<00:02:21.010> but

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
stiff icing like piping consistency but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.400 
stiff icing like piping consistency but
the<00:02:21.250> stiff<00:02:21.550> side<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.900> doesn't<00:02:23.080> drip

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
the stiff side so that it doesn't drip

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.470 
the stiff side so that it doesn't drip
off<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.800> cookie<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:27.360> simple<00:02:28.360> as

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
off the cookie and that's it simple as

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.900 
off the cookie and that's it simple as
that<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.989> once<00:02:29.470> they're<00:02:29.709> all<00:02:29.860> done<00:02:30.190> I'm<00:02:30.459> going

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
that and once they're all done I'm going

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.830 
that and once they're all done I'm going
to<00:02:31.090> paint<00:02:31.989> them<00:02:32.350> black<00:02:33.130> again<00:02:33.520> on<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.540> side

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
to paint them black again on this side

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.229 
to paint them black again on this side
and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:36.220> I'm<00:02:36.310> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.459> come<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.000> add

here<00:02:53.050> this<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.940> went<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.239> did<00:02:55.510> his<00:02:55.810> belly

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
here this one I went and did his belly

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.670 
here this one I went and did his belly
so<00:02:57.730> it's<00:02:58.090> kind<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.570> if<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.810> watched<00:02:59.019> my<00:02:59.170> monkey

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
so it's kind of if you watched my monkey

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.650 
so it's kind of if you watched my monkey
video<00:02:59.980> kind<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:00.940> shape<00:03:01.300> for<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
video kind of that shape for the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.990 
video kind of that shape for the
features<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.900> have<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.260> white<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.549> I'm<00:03:06.790> going

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
features to have the white so I'm going

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.170 
features to have the white so I'm going
to<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.120> pipe<00:03:07.570> one<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.200> show<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.820> I'll<00:03:09.820> work

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
to just pipe one to show you I'll work

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.310 
to just pipe one to show you I'll work
on<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.450> one<00:03:11.880> right<00:03:12.880> here<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.640> I'm<00:03:15.790> doing<00:03:16.320> it's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
on the one right here so I'm doing it's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.500 
on the one right here so I'm doing it's
not<00:03:17.560> dots<00:03:17.950> for<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.640> particular<00:03:19.239> case

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
not dots for this particular case

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.310 
not dots for this particular case
because<00:03:19.570> it's<00:03:20.410> much<00:03:21.329> bigger<00:03:22.329> than<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
because it's much bigger than the the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.690 
because it's much bigger than the the
monkey<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:25.120> kind<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.540> big<00:03:25.750> circle<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.470> then

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
monkey so kind of a big circle and then

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.050 
monkey so kind of a big circle and then
like<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> heart<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.299> guess<00:03:28.540> for<00:03:28.810> his<00:03:29.640> his<00:03:30.640> face

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
like a heart I guess for his his face

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.830 
like a heart I guess for his his face
mask<00:03:31.480> area<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.510> I'm<00:03:34.780> just<00:03:36.510> filling<00:03:37.510> this

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
mask area so that I'm just filling this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.950 
mask area so that I'm just filling this
in

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.680 

and<00:03:45.080> there<00:03:45.740> we<00:03:45.890> go<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.730> then<00:03:46.910> once<00:03:47.150> that's<00:03:47.390> a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
and there we go and then once that's a

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.450 
and there we go and then once that's a
little<00:03:47.990> bit<00:03:48.140> dry<00:03:48.410> I'll<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.860> able<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.130> come<00:03:49.310> in
