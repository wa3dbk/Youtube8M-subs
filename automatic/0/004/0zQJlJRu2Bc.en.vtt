there on Route 23 I think it is the one
that<00:05:25.040> leads<00:05:25.340> up<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:26.230> victory<00:05:27.230> road<00:05:27.470> then<00:05:27.830> you

already have a swablu but it's in
kitchen<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:43.100> can<00:05:43.250> always<00:05:43.370> evolve<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:43.850> into

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880

a I can evolve it into an altaria and

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.070 
a I can evolve it into an altaria and
then<00:05:48.530> that'd<00:05:49.280> be<00:05:49.370> great<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.790> then<00:05:50.630> I<00:05:50.840> think

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
then that'd be great and then I think
