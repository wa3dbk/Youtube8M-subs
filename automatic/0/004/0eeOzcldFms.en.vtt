00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
it and you wouldn't think easily but he

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.500 
it and you wouldn't think easily but he
is<00:02:20.340> quite<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.850> quite<00:02:21.030> tough<00:02:21.390> to

which is his problem or they're gonna

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.260 
which is his problem or they're gonna
play<00:02:25.590> barrini<00:02:26.010> who<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.340> think<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> quality

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
play barrini who I think is a quality

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.580 
play barrini who I think is a quality
player<00:02:27.420> he's<00:02:27.720> gonna<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.020> hard<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> vetting

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
player he's gonna be hard the vetting

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.810 
player he's gonna be hard the vetting
it's<00:02:28.710> not<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> biggest<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.310> guys<00:02:29.490> but<00:02:29.700> he's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
it's not the biggest of guys but he's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.640 
it's not the biggest of guys but he's
got<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> good<00:02:30.180> finish<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.870> him<00:02:31.020> he's<00:02:31.380> quite

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
got a good finish on on him he's quite

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
got a good finish on on him he's quite
Pacey<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.250> he's<00:02:32.340> very<00:02:32.520> agile<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.090> he<00:02:33.210> will<00:02:33.300> be

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
Pacey and he's very agile so he will be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.180 
Pacey and he's very agile so he will be
hard<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.630> defend<00:02:33.840> against<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.380> again<00:02:35.070> he

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
hard to defend against but again he

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.740 
hard to defend against but again he
should<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.550> nothing<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.850> Arsenal<00:02:36.450> shouldn't

be<00:02:36.810> able<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.020> handle<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.860> should<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.070> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
be able to handle and it should be a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.710 
be able to handle and it should be a
straight<00:02:38.610> board<00:02:38.940> free<00:02:39.180> plays<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> mean<00:02:39.600> it's

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
if we play the same way we did in a

Premier League game under his belt in a

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.880 
Premier League game under his belt in a
space<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.990> week<00:03:37.170> although<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.650> might<00:03:37.740> be

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
space of a week although it might be

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.290 
space of a week although it might be
quite<00:03:38.100> tiring<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.580> him<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:38.940> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.209> an

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
quite tiring for him it's going to be an

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.020 
quite tiring for him it's going to be an
excellent<00:03:39.780> experience<00:03:40.110> for<00:03:40.709> him<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.030> what

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
excellent experience for him and what

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.490 
excellent experience for him and what
he's<00:03:42.209> playing<00:03:42.450> well<00:03:42.630> there's<00:03:42.930> no<00:03:43.050> reason<00:03:43.380> why

I<00:03:43.530> should<00:03:43.739> be<00:03:43.860> dropped<00:03:44.160> although

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
I should be dropped although

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.430 
I should be dropped although
realistically<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:45.630> think<00:03:45.720> she<00:03:46.050> room<00:03:46.230> might

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
realistically I think she room might

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.140 
realistically I think she room might
actually<00:03:46.590> start<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> game<00:03:47.340> considering

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
actually start the game considering

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.610 
actually start the game considering
sunoco<00:03:48.570> is<00:03:48.690> still<00:03:48.870> fairly<00:03:49.110> young<00:03:49.230> easy

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
sunoco is still fairly young easy

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.680 
sunoco is still fairly young easy
injury-prone<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:51.480> would<00:03:51.660> be

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
injury-prone I think it would be

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
expected was to rest him and giroux I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.520 
expected was to rest him and giroux I
think<00:03:53.910> if<00:03:54.239> he<00:03:54.540> comes<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.200> said<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
think if he comes on like I said the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.100 
think if he comes on like I said the

his<00:04:13.050> game<00:04:13.230> when<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.410> could<00:04:13.560> put<00:04:13.680> in<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.800> really

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
his game when you could put in a really

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.190 
his game when you could put in a really
poor<00:04:14.190> performance<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:14.910> I'm<00:04:15.120> hoping<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.080> would

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
poor performance so I'm hoping it would

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.539 
poor performance so I'm hoping it would
be<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.380> first<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.770> there<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.040> hoping<00:04:17.430> he's

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
be the first one there on a hoping he's

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.680 
be the first one there on a hoping he's
going<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.760> put<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.000> good<00:04:18.090> performance<00:04:18.150> if<00:04:18.600> he

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
going to put in a good performance if he

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.750 
going to put in a good performance if he
does<00:04:18.870> play<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:19.290> nevertheless<00:04:19.950> who<00:04:20.310> does<00:04:20.489> play
