00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
but I think getting these every like

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.230 
but I think getting these every like
even<00:00:19.020> games<00:00:19.200> are<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.680> plays<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.970> plays

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
even games are the little plays or plays

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490

that's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.250> tackle<00:03:08.640> right<00:03:08.760> now

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
that's a tackle right now

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.630 
that's a tackle right now
I<00:03:09.480> keep<00:03:09.960> looking<00:03:10.140> at<00:03:10.380> him<00:03:10.530> people

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I keep looking at him people

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.150 
I keep looking at him people
but<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.210> as<00:03:12.390> soon<00:03:12.569> as<00:03:12.750> he<00:03:12.870> spins<00:03:13.200> away<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
but then as soon as he spins away the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.920 
but then as soon as he spins away the
left<00:03:14.370> guard<00:03:14.550> knows<00:03:14.790> he<00:03:14.940> cannot<00:03:15.300> he's<00:03:15.780> not

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
left guard knows he cannot he's not

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.800 
left guard knows he cannot he's not
gonna<00:03:16.020> be<00:03:16.110> able<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.380> engage<00:03:16.500> on<00:03:16.920> him<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.780> he

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
gonna be able to engage on him and so he

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.790 
gonna be able to engage on him and so he
goes<00:03:19.230> out<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:21.209> make<00:03:21.360> stop<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.319> linebacker

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
goes out to make stop on the linebacker

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.150 
goes out to make stop on the linebacker
but<00:03:23.640> by<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:23.850> point<00:03:24.350> play<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.680> already<00:03:26.040> over

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
but by this point play is already over

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.410 
but by this point play is already over
and<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.060> running<00:03:27.209> back<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.600> tackled

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
and the running back is tackled

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.990 
and the running back is tackled
and<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.900> thought<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.170> was<00:03:30.380> an<00:03:30.530> amazing<00:03:30.830> job<00:03:31.730> on

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
and I thought that was an amazing job on

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.530 
and I thought that was an amazing job on
the<00:03:32.569> AI<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.290> defense

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
the AI of the defense

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.830 
the AI of the defense
to<00:03:35.079> recognize<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
to recognize the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.380 
to recognize the
in<00:03:37.900> Blancos<00:03:38.290> coming<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.459> spin<00:03:39.910> away<00:03:40.030> from

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
in Blancos coming and to spin away from

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.340 
in Blancos coming and to spin away from
it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
it

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.860 
it
in<00:03:41.710> order<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.730> free<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.390> make<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.630> stop

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
in order to get free and make the stop

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.260 
in order to get free and make the stop
behind<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.440> line

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270
