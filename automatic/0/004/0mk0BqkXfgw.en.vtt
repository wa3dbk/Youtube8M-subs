00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260 
well people always say to me you know
there's<00:00:19.640> extraterrestrials<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.029> there's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
there's extraterrestrials and if there's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.939 
there's extraterrestrials and if there's
UFOs<00:00:21.750> why<00:00:22.109> don't<00:00:22.350> they<00:00:22.470> make<00:00:22.650> themselves

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
UFOs why don't they make themselves

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
UFOs why don't they make themselves
known<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> us<00:00:23.880> publicly<00:00:25.099> well<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.519> think<00:00:26.849> with

kind of rough circular formation
appearing<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.159> piece<00:01:05.159> de

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
appearing and then you get the piece de

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
appearing and then you get the piece de
resistance<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> last<00:01:08.119> or<00:01:09.119> comes<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it finds its position it lights up and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
it finds its position it lights up and
then<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.250> sort<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.939> dance<00:01:21.299> of

lights around this formation now this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.499 
lights around this formation now this
suggests<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:27.080> incredible<00:01:28.159> intelligence

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
suggests to me incredible intelligence

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.740 
suggests to me incredible intelligence
it<00:01:30.509> suggests<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.259> me<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:32.159> saying

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
it suggests to me that they are saying

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.630 
it suggests to me that they are saying
look<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:33.930> us<00:01:34.079> look<00:01:34.799> how<00:01:34.979> clever<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.900> and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
look at us look how clever we are and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:02:02.370 
look at us look how clever we are and
it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.920> astounding<00:01:41.090> piece<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.390> footage

electric storms start the UFOs swarm

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.890 
electric storms start the UFOs swarm
into<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.209> area<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:27.620> almost<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:28.310> they're

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
into the area it's almost as if they're

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.160 
into the area it's almost as if they're
harvesting<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:31.360> electromagnetic<00:02:32.360> energy

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
