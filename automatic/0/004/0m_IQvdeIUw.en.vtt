for<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> back<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.209> am<00:02:18.510> using<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.349> I

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
for the back of that I am using so I

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.160 
for the back of that I am using so I
thought<00:02:19.739> I've<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.959> sharpie<00:02:21.959> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
thought I've just got a sharpie and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.840 
thought I've just got a sharpie and
going<00:02:22.950> in

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.180 

and<00:02:30.420> you'll<00:02:30.570> see<00:02:30.810> I've<00:02:31.050> got<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.590> perfect

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and you'll see I've got the perfect

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.520 
and you'll see I've got the perfect
shape<00:02:32.490> for<00:02:34.160> for<00:02:35.160> my<00:02:35.400> frame<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.900> next<00:02:37.200> step<00:02:37.350> I'm

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
shape for for my frame the next step I'm

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.100 
shape for for my frame the next step I'm
going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> do<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.190> take<00:02:38.550> my<00:02:38.820> big<00:02:39.120> scissors<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
going to do is take my big scissors and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.950 
going to do is take my big scissors and
I'm<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> cut<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.820> whole<00:02:42.270> shape

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
I'm just going to cut this whole shape

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.350 
I'm just going to cut this whole shape
out

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
out

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.490 
out
right<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:45.870> now<00:02:46.050> I've<00:02:46.320> got<00:02:46.650> my<00:02:46.680> backer<00:02:47.640> shape

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
right so now I've got my backer shape

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.970 
right so now I've got my backer shape
it'll<00:02:49.500> fit<00:02:49.890> exactly<00:02:50.880> into<00:02:51.720> my<00:02:52.110> frame<00:02:52.380> you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
it'll fit exactly into my frame you

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.070 
it'll fit exactly into my frame you
should<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:53.640> having<00:02:53.880> your<00:02:54.710> hot<00:02:55.710> glue<00:02:55.980> gun

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
should be having your hot glue gun

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.050 
should be having your hot glue gun
warming<00:02:58.080> up<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> make<00:02:58.590> sure<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.430> glue<00:02:59.640> is

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
warming up to make sure that the glue is

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.440 
warming up to make sure that the glue is
hot<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.930> ready<00:03:01.170> for<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.650> another<00:03:02.580> step<00:03:03.120> that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
hot and ready for you another step that

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.870 
hot and ready for you another step that
I<00:03:03.480> would<00:03:03.840> suggest<00:03:04.050> doing<00:03:04.650> kind<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> will

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
I would suggest doing kind of will

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.820 
I would suggest doing kind of will
depend<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.840> frame<00:03:07.080> you're<00:03:07.290> using<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
depend on the frame you're using in the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.690 
depend on the frame you're using in the
size<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.790> what<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.270> inner<00:03:09.570> dimension<00:03:10.140> is

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
size of what this inner dimension is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.850 
size of what this inner dimension is
since<00:03:11.700> mine<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:13.310> 12<00:03:14.310> by<00:03:14.610> 24<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:16.200> squares<00:03:16.560> I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
since mine is a 12 by 24 the squares I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.770 
since mine is a 12 by 24 the squares I
got<00:03:17.540> were<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:19.470> my<00:03:19.680> club<00:03:19.980> tiles<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.210> they<00:03:21.450> fit

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
got were for my club tiles so they fit

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.130 
got were for my club tiles so they fit
exactly<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:24.090> other<00:03:24.240> option<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.110> don't

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
exactly the other option if you don't

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.900 
exactly the other option if you don't
want<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.150> cork<00:03:27.600> sort<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.530> look<00:03:28.950> you

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
want to have the cork sort of look you

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.380 
want to have the cork sort of look you
can<00:03:30.450> go<00:03:30.690> ahead<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.380> spray<00:03:32.070> these<00:03:32.310> any<00:03:32.700> color

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
can go ahead and spray these any color

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.300 
can go ahead and spray these any color
you<00:03:33.630> want<00:03:33.840> they<00:03:34.170> do<00:03:34.230> accept<00:03:34.740> paint<00:03:35.070> really

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you want they do accept paint really

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.890 
you want they do accept paint really
well<00:03:35.460> you<00:03:35.910> don't<00:03:35.940> even<00:03:36.210> have<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.450> use<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> spray

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
well you don't even have to use a spray

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.290 
well you don't even have to use a spray
paint<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.380> use<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.590> standard<00:03:37.950> paint<00:03:38.520> but<00:03:39.270> I

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
paint you can use a standard paint but I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.020 
paint you can use a standard paint but I
would<00:03:39.690> suggest<00:03:39.900> doing<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.560> step<00:03:41.040> prior<00:03:41.700> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
would suggest doing that step prior to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.610 
would suggest doing that step prior to
having<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.600> your<00:03:42.630> friend<00:03:42.960> and<00:03:43.230> take<00:03:43.350> my

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
having it in your friend and take my

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.980 
having it in your friend and take my
glue<00:03:43.950> gun<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.490> I'm<00:03:45.150> going<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.480> start<00:03:45.780> going

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
glue gun and I'm going to start going

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.250 
glue gun and I'm going to start going
along<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.540> innermost<00:03:48.950> part<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.810> my<00:03:51.810> frame

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
along the the innermost part of my frame

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.350 
along the the innermost part of my frame
I'm<00:03:52.709> going<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.040> line<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.370> all<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.209> way

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
I'm going to line that all the way

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.500 
I'm going to line that all the way
around<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:55.230> my<00:03:55.770> course<00:03:56.070> has<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> good<00:03:56.670> um<00:03:57.500> firm

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
around so my course has a good um firm

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.559 
around so my course has a good um firm
place<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:02.489> go<00:04:02.700> into

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.949 

so<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.469> YC<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.069> won't<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:10.209> won't<00:04:10.360> go<00:04:10.659> anywhere

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
so that YC it won't it won't go anywhere

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.380 
so that YC it won't it won't go anywhere
and<00:04:11.319> I'll<00:04:11.469> stay<00:04:12.069> once<00:04:12.489> you've<00:04:12.670> got<00:04:12.939> all<00:04:13.359> of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
and I'll stay once you've got all of

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.560 
and I'll stay once you've got all of
your<00:04:13.629> cork<00:04:14.200> glued<00:04:14.829> in<00:04:15.159> place<00:04:15.189> I<00:04:15.670> have<00:04:16.030> actually

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
your cork glued in place I have actually

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.219 
your cork glued in place I have actually
done<00:04:16.780> both<00:04:17.139> layers<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.889> on<00:04:18.609> both<00:04:19.060> layers<00:04:19.720> I

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
done both layers and on both layers I

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.040 
done both layers and on both layers I
did<00:04:20.739> do<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.729> middle<00:04:22.180> where<00:04:22.449> they<00:04:22.630> seem

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
did do in the middle where they seem

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.520 
did do in the middle where they seem
together<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.590> did<00:04:24.009> actually<00:04:24.520> do<00:04:24.759> a<00:04:24.789> layer<00:04:25.530> of

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
together I did actually do a layer of

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.800 
together I did actually do a layer of
hot<00:04:26.919> glue<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.310> kind<00:04:27.729> of<00:04:27.789> seam<00:04:28.180> them<00:04:28.509> together

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
hot glue to kind of seam them together

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.290 
hot glue to kind of seam them together
especially<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.070> back<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.880> can<00:04:31.030> see<00:04:31.270> a

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
especially on the back you can see a

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.820 
especially on the back you can see a
little<00:04:31.810> bit<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.530> seam<00:04:33.330> but<00:04:34.330> overall<00:04:34.960> it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
little bit of that seam but overall it

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.730 
little bit of that seam but overall it
all<00:04:35.949> fits<00:04:36.250> snug<00:04:36.759> it's<00:04:37.270> not<00:04:37.509> going<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.750> pop<00:04:38.470> out

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
all fits snug it's not going to pop out

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.640 
all fits snug it's not going to pop out
unless<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.220> really<00:04:39.669> really<00:04:40.110> hardcore<00:04:41.110> push

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
unless you really really hardcore push

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.960 
unless you really really hardcore push
on<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.669> so<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.509> next<00:04:43.750> step<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:45.400> put<00:04:45.610> on<00:04:45.759> your

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
on it so the next step is to put on your

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.890 
on it so the next step is to put on your
backer<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.360> can<00:04:46.750> use<00:04:47.820> kind<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.150> wood<00:04:49.570> if<00:04:49.840> you

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
backer you can use kind of a wood if you

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.779 
backer you can use kind of a wood if you
want<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.650> am<00:04:50.680> going<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:51.039> be<00:04:51.160> using<00:04:51.310> cardboard

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
want I am going to be using cardboard

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.730 
want I am going to be using cardboard
just<00:04:52.240> because<00:04:52.449> I<00:04:52.509> know<00:04:52.570> some<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.020> my<00:04:53.320> earrings

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
just because I know some of my earrings

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.580 
just because I know some of my earrings
are<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.210> little<00:04:55.210> bit<00:04:55.570> longer<00:04:55.870> than<00:04:56.229> even<00:04:56.560> that

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
are a little bit longer than even that

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.089 
are a little bit longer than even that
double<00:04:57.130> layer<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:57.729> this<00:04:58.330> will<00:04:58.570> keep<00:04:58.720> them<00:04:59.020> from

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
double layer so this will keep them from

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.909 
double layer so this will keep them from
hitting<00:05:00.099> wood<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.849> not<00:05:01.030> sticking<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.050> not
