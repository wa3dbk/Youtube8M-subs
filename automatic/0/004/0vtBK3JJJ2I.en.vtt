00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Are you going to change your only car tire? 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.160
 you only need two tires 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 here comes the doubt where I'm going to put 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.230
 these two tires on the front axle or 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:20.519
 rear 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:20.519
 [Music] 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.990
 [Music] 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.660
 it is our culture at the moment of exchanging 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.330
 the tire of the car and you just need 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.750
 two tires we put on the axle 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.980
 Front why because this is where the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.809
 Tire spends more right then spend more and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.510
 It ends faster you end up with a 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.280
 new tire will it be that this choice of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.750
 putting the tires in the front was the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:59.000
 correct is simply the fact that the tire spending 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.879
 more ahead is already touch indicating the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.489
 where you should put these new tires 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.440
 in the back is quite the opposite of what 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.610
 we imagine 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.930
 the tire to spend more on the front for two 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.100
 motives right 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 is the largest weight of the car focuses on 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.060
 front cause of the engine 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.070
 most cars have the traction 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.470
 also makes the tire wear more 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.799
 and the heat is also much higher in the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.869
 front and rear is not the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.030
 Brake is all here in front 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.780
 so why you should put the tire 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.270
 new in the rear because precisely by the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.399
 rear of the car without lighter 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.619
 she needs a better tire to 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.820
 drain the water because the front 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.369
 own weight of the car will compensate the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.280
 greater tire wear is at the front 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.280
 so when you change the tire 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.759
 needing two tires put the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.369
 new cars at the rear and the most 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.429
 front in a rainy situation 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.000
 if you have the tire the new tires 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.870
 in the forefront what will happen 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.910
 You have more water flow but 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.770
 there is contact of the tire with the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.720
 the front tire because this tire 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.330
 water is in front of it 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.060
 the back for being lighter she goes to 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.420
 planar much faster than the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.520
 front the car in a curve it goes 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.690
 lose the rear or that rear 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.000
 will skid 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.040
 Are you going to give a stick horse a 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.380
 run in the middle of the track 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.090
 already if you put the tires 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.920
 eggs in the back like there in the back 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.860
 you will have a better flow of 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.150
 Water eta back will become more 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.390
 stable with more contact in a soil and you 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.810
 will lose the first one the front is her 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:05.060
 that will trickle down in the conversion of a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.390
 car that is skidding in this capo 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.040
 is much easier than it is in the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.880
 rear escapement 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.640
 you're doing a curve and its 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.590
 car starts to escape from it he goes 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.540
 his tendency is that instead of him 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.440
 want to make the curve and stay 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.090
 wanting and then instinctively the right 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 that you will make one more listen 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.960
 steering wheel or even relieve the foot 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.210
 accelerator 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.830
 this throttle relief is when you 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.260
 takes close you are taking the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.650
 acceleration is automatically 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.180
 right correction a car coming out front 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.290
 already when the car left the rear, which 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.790
 happens 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.210
 Are you making a turn for the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.560
 left the correction we call on 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.590
 this text you have to turn the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.790
 contrary to the direction of the curve you 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.500
 Is doing 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.030
 you 're turning left you're going 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.420
 have to correct a steering wheel for the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.120
 right is already a more difficult practice. 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.940
 often used by pilots who are already right 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.860
 you do this on a daily basis, you 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.240
 will have to have some training 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.310
 for this correction 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.910
 then so it is easier you have 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.250
 a car controlling a car has gone out of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.820
 front than rear 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.290
 so new tires on the rear more 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.200
 worn at the front 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.080
 that's it folks you've always heard 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.290
 talk that the new tire is put in front 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.020
 you have to change your concept to safety 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.670
 first of all 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.059
 [Applause]
