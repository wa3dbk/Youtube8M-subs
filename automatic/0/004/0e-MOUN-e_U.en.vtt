a<00:00:41.540> big<00:00:42.540> indication<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> big

a big indication of that was the big
smile<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.580> saw<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.910> short<00:00:45.210> program<00:00:45.390> where

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
smile we saw in the short program where

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320 
smile we saw in the short program where
she<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.650> third<00:00:46.920> setting<00:00:47.519> up<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.300> a

she lands it however not sure if she

will get credit until we see the replays
as<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.830> whether<00:01:00.040> or<00:01:00.280> not<00:01:00.370> she<00:01:00.640> completed<00:01:01.060> the
