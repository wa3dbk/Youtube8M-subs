00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and I thought it would be

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.670 
and I thought it would be
after<00:00:14.940> Chris<00:00:15.180> died<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.720> what<00:00:15.870> was<00:00:17.600> it<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.869> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680

know step up to the plate and deal with

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.920 
know step up to the plate and deal with
this<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.099> was<00:00:23.250> beautiful<00:00:23.849> and<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.330> really

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
this and it was beautiful and it really

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.999 
this and it was beautiful and it really
was<00:00:25.460> something<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.349> Chris<00:00:28.349> Wood<00:00:28.619> Chris<00:00:28.830> was

still in our presence I think at that
point<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.949> don't<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.699> so<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> he's<00:00:33.480> hearing

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
point I don't think so that he's hearing

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.439 
point I don't think so that he's hearing
now<00:00:33.900> but<00:00:34.110> he<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> journey<00:00:35.220> with<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.519> he

that he saw and sounds he heard you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
that he saw and sounds he heard you
didn't<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.159> anyone<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> say<00:01:05.940> did<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.570> hear

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.950 
didn't have anyone to say did you hear
that<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.320> oh<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.159> gosh<00:01:08.580> look<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> he<00:01:09.869> had

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that or oh my gosh look at that he had

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
that or oh my gosh look at that he had
nobody<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.190> think<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.880> he

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
nobody and I think that's when he

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
nobody and I think that's when he
started<00:01:12.420> knowing<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.520> how<00:01:14.520> important<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
started knowing that how important it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.289 
started knowing that how important it
was<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.140> love<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.950> give<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
was to to love back to give back to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.040 
was to to love back to give back to
people<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.640> he<00:01:20.640> he<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.120> always<00:01:21.300> a<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.840> at

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
people and he he was always a good at

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.080 
people and he he was always a good at
that<00:01:22.410> but<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.980> he<00:01:23.040> realized<00:01:23.730> that<00:01:23.940> that's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that but now he realized that that's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.290 
that but now he realized that that's
what<00:01:24.420> lets<00:01:24.990> make<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.980> what<00:01:26.310> makes<00:01:26.640> life<00:01:26.970> go

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
what lets make it's what makes life go

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.380 
what lets make it's what makes life go
around<00:01:27.660> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.230> is<00:01:28.850> sharing<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.000> others

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
around I think is sharing with others

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.060 
around I think is sharing with others
giving<00:01:31.290> back<00:01:31.580> he<00:01:32.580> was<00:01:32.730> good

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.970 

and<00:01:35.640> he<00:01:35.730> learned<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.360> important<00:01:36.980> but

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
and he learned that it was important but

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.560 
and he learned that it was important but
I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:38.580> would<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.760> survived<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I think if he would have survived this

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.720 
I think if he would have survived this
he<00:01:40.350> would<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.620> been<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.800> leader<00:01:41.130> amongst

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
he would have been a leader amongst

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.130 
he would have been a leader amongst
young<00:01:42.000> people<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:44.150> help<00:01:45.150> them<00:01:45.330> go<00:01:45.570> along<00:01:45.870> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
young people to help them go along that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.700 
young people to help them go along that
Trek<00:01:46.460> knowing<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.730> it's<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.260> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
