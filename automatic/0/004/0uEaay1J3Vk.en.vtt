00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.809 
person means is your first language
English<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.769> like<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.340> grew<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.670> learning

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
English so so like I grew up learning

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.170 
English so so like I grew up learning
English<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.600> Arabic<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.590> my<00:03:18.340> sentences<00:03:18.970> were
