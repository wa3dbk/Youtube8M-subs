00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
shower cap and I replaced it with our

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.300 
shower cap and I replaced it with our
old<00:02:46.640> stocking<00:02:47.120> caps<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.540> are<00:02:47.600> very<00:02:47.840> sleep

old stocking caps that are very sleep
then<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.340> thought<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.239> boot<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.930> directly

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
then I thought the boot is it directly

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.770 
then I thought the boot is it directly
still<00:02:52.940> isn't<00:02:53.390> directly<00:02:54.700> keep<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:56.239> contact

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
still isn't directly keep in contact

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.460 
still isn't directly keep in contact
with<00:02:57.170> my<00:02:57.500> real<00:02:57.800> with<00:02:58.190> my<00:02:58.459> hair<00:02:59.050> that's<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.260> sir

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
with my real with my hair that's it sir

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.229 
with my real with my hair that's it sir
and<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.810> how<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.170> felt<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:05.060> is

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
and so this is how we felt do this is

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.729 
and so this is how we felt do this is
still<00:03:05.570> true<00:03:07.209> fast<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:09.049> we're<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.650> to
