it's cheaper than buying those parts for
sure<00:04:49.479> and<00:04:49.750> quicker<00:04:49.930> than<00:04:50.110> having<00:04:50.410> them

reason<00:04:52.600> why<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.750> like<00:04:53.199> this<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.680> love<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.910> fact

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
reason why I like this I love the fact

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.779 
reason why I like this I love the fact
that<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.419> can<00:04:55.660> design<00:04:56.020> prototype<00:04:56.860> test<00:04:57.280> refine

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
that I can design prototype test refine

and perfect my projects without ever
leaving<00:05:01.060> my<00:05:01.330> lab<00:05:01.539> I<00:05:10.110> have<00:05:11.110> had<00:05:11.590> so<00:05:12.039> much<00:05:12.340> fun

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
leaving my lab I have had so much fun

leaving my lab I have had so much fun
with<00:05:12.970> this<00:05:13.000> printer<00:05:13.330> over<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.930> last<00:05:14.139> month

with this printer over the last month
again<00:05:15.039> it's<00:05:15.190> just<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.580> idea<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:16.270> seeing

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
again it's just that idea of seeing

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.110 
again it's just that idea of seeing
things<00:05:17.260> come<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.680> life<00:05:17.710> before<00:05:18.099> your<00:05:18.669> eyes<00:05:18.700> and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
things come to life before your eyes and

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.540 
things come to life before your eyes and
again<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.200> whole<00:05:20.440> idea<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.889> having<00:05:21.220> something

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
again the whole idea of having something

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.430 
again the whole idea of having something
like<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.820> da<00:05:21.910> vinci<00:05:22.150> jr.<00:05:22.180> is<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.139> give

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
like the da vinci jr. is that you give

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.159 
like the da vinci jr. is that you give
beginners<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.550> place<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.270> start<00:05:25.539> this<00:05:25.750> is<00:05:25.960> not

priced<00:05:53.680> 349<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.729> a<00:05:54.760> great<00:05:55.180> starting<00:05:55.599> point<00:05:55.810> I

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
priced 349 is a great starting point I

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.689 
priced 349 is a great starting point I
also<00:05:56.530> like<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.800> fact<00:05:56.889> that<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.310> can<00:05:57.580> work

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
also like the fact that it can work

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.700 
also like the fact that it can work
completely<00:05:58.210> independently<00:05:58.990> of<00:05:59.169> a<00:05:59.260> computer

completely independently of a computer

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.719 
completely independently of a computer
you<00:06:00.010> just<00:06:00.250> use<00:06:00.400> that<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:01.270> SD<00:06:01.660> card<00:06:01.690> here<00:06:02.349> and

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
you just use that the SD card here and

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.279 
you just use that the SD card here and
essentially<00:06:03.729> this<00:06:04.300> becomes<00:06:04.810> its<00:06:05.080> own

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
essentially this becomes its own

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.409 
essentially this becomes its own
building<00:06:05.650> workstation<00:06:06.580> I<00:06:06.729> also<00:06:07.150> like<00:06:07.389> the

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
building workstation I also like the

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.490 
building workstation I also like the
fact<00:06:07.510> that<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:08.289> the<00:06:08.979> print<00:06:09.280> time<00:06:09.820> is<00:06:10.500> quite

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
fact that the the print time is quite

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.050 
fact that the the print time is quite
good<00:06:11.680> it's<00:06:12.159> not<00:06:12.340> good<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.610> it's<00:06:12.849> not<00:06:12.940> the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
good it's not good that it's not the

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.940 
good it's not good that it's not the
fast<00:06:13.360> straighty<00:06:13.810> printer<00:06:14.140> on<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.320> market<00:06:14.620> but

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
fast straighty printer on the market but

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.270 
fast straighty printer on the market but
it's<00:06:15.099> tough

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
it's tough

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.550 
it's tough
not<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:15.639> slowest<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.300> I<00:06:16.870> also<00:06:17.080> like<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.530> fact

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
not the slowest and I also like the fact

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.010 
not the slowest and I also like the fact
that<00:06:17.830> with<00:06:18.280> with<00:06:18.790> the<00:06:18.880> use<00:06:19.060> of<00:06:19.090> standard<00:06:19.810> file

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
that with with the use of standard file

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.909 
that with with the use of standard file
formats<00:06:20.530> I<00:06:20.710> can<00:06:21.100> get<00:06:21.280> thing<00:06:21.490> from<00:06:21.670> the<00:06:21.790> XYZ<00:06:22.090> a

no-brainer<00:06:33.490> has<00:06:34.480> got<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.840> be<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:36.090> drm<00:06:37.090> on<00:06:37.360> the

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
no-brainer has got to be the drm on the

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.210 
no-brainer has got to be the drm on the
Philippine<00:06:38.110> now<00:06:38.290> I<00:06:38.440> know<00:06:38.500> they<00:06:38.860> don't<00:06:38.980> call<00:06:39.190> it

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
Philippine now I know they don't call it

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.830 
Philippine now I know they don't call it
drm<00:06:39.730> but<00:06:39.910> that's<00:06:40.030> essentially<00:06:40.389> what<00:06:40.630> it<00:06:40.660> is

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
drm but that's essentially what it is

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.500 
drm but that's essentially what it is
yes<00:06:41.470> it<00:06:41.740> does<00:06:41.770> make<00:06:42.280> it<00:06:42.400> easier<00:06:42.639> because<00:06:43.120> now

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
yes it does make it easier because now

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.879 
yes it does make it easier because now
your<00:06:43.660> printer<00:06:43.930> knows<00:06:44.080> exactly<00:06:44.380> what's<00:06:44.740> been

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
your printer knows exactly what's been

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.740 
your printer knows exactly what's been
loaded<00:06:45.310> but<00:06:45.850> that<00:06:46.000> would<00:06:46.120> make<00:06:46.240> sense<00:06:46.300> on<00:06:46.690> a

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750

loaded but that would make sense on a
printer<00:06:47.080> that<00:06:47.110> could<00:06:47.380> load<00:06:47.590> abs<00:06:48.250> or<00:06:48.520> PLA<00:06:48.970> since

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
printer that could load abs or PLA since

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.200 
printer that could load abs or PLA since
this<00:06:49.780> only<00:06:50.080> does<00:06:50.440> PLA<00:06:51.130> which<00:06:51.700> by<00:06:51.970> the<00:06:52.030> way<00:06:52.120> is

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
this only does PLA which by the way is

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.570 
this only does PLA which by the way is
another<00:06:52.660> con<00:06:52.930> you<00:06:53.740> really<00:06:54.070> don't<00:06:54.250> need<00:06:54.370> it<00:06:54.490> the

another con you really don't need it the

another con you really don't need it the

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
only reason why you would have it is

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.080 
only reason why you would have it is
because<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.350> want<00:06:56.560> to<00:06:56.710> force<00:06:57.040> people<00:06:57.250> to<00:06:57.610> buy

your filament and XYZ filament is going

your filament and XYZ filament is going
to<00:07:01.300> be<00:07:01.450> twenty<00:07:02.140> percent<00:07:02.440> more<00:07:02.650> expensive<00:07:03.190> than

to be twenty percent more expensive than
standard<00:07:03.880> filament<00:07:04.270> that's<00:07:04.450> I<00:07:04.750> don't<00:07:05.320> like
