00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hey everyone it is Tim grant so a few

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey everyone it is Tim grant so a few
days<00:00:03.810> ago<00:00:03.990> I'm<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.529> little<00:00:04.980> behind<00:00:05.069> on<00:00:05.370> my<00:00:05.430> blog

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
days ago I'm a little behind on my blog

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.320 
days ago I'm a little behind on my blog
so<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> few<00:00:06.930> days<00:00:07.049> ago<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.560> bought<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.730> textbooks

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
so a few days ago I bought my textbooks

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.020 
so a few days ago I bought my textbooks
for<00:00:09.599> college<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:11.269> here<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.870> first<00:00:13.110> one

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
for college and so here is the first one

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.370 
for college and so here is the first one
it<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.330> college<00:00:16.080> algebra<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.980> trigonometry

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
it is college algebra and trigonometry

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.029 
it is college algebra and trigonometry
so<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.910> just<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.300> normal<00:00:21.930> textbook

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
so it's just a normal textbook

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
so it's just a normal textbook
oh<00:00:23.630> right<00:00:24.630> plus<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:26.000> student<00:00:27.000> access<00:00:27.510> kit<00:00:27.810> not

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
oh right plus a student access kit not

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.979 
oh right plus a student access kit not
sure<00:00:28.769> exactly<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.490> does<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> all<00:00:31.399> but

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
sure exactly what this does it all but

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.069 
sure exactly what this does it all but
yeah<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
yeah so I think it you can get on the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.190 
yeah so I think it you can get on the
internet<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:38.030> find<00:00:39.030> questions<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.989> something

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
internet and find questions or something

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.639 
internet and find questions or something
like<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
like that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.020

um yeah so just a normal text book right
here<00:00:45.030> has<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.770> math<00:00:46.770> questions<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.110> stuff

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
here has the math questions and stuff

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.369 
here has the math questions and stuff
like<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:50.539> a<00:00:51.539> normal<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.230> you'd

see<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.460> time<00:00:53.809> um<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:55.230> second<00:00:55.680> book<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
see all the time um my second book is a

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.229 
see all the time um my second book is a
chemistry<00:00:59.699> book

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
chemistry book

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.939 
chemistry book
this<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.680> worksheet<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.149> workbook

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.730 
have 171 about 200 pages so yeah there's
my<00:01:22.979> chemistry<00:01:23.490> work<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:25.290> actual

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
my chemistry work but my actual

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.719 
my chemistry work but my actual
chemistry<00:01:26.330> book<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.950> coming<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.520> bought

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
chemistry book will be coming I bought

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.740 
chemistry book will be coming I bought
that<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.450> Amazon<00:01:31.640> because<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> lot

that one on Amazon because it was a lot
cheaper<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.170> Amazon<00:01:34.200> than<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> actually<00:01:35.369> buy

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
cheaper on Amazon than to actually buy

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
cheaper on Amazon than to actually buy
it<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> bookstore<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> other

books these three books the next one

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
books these three books the next one
I'll<00:01:39.780> show<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.909> cheap<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I'll show you it was just as cheap to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.280 
I'll show you it was just as cheap to
buy<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:44.329> at<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.689> actual<00:01:45.990> store<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> here's<00:01:49.110> my

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
buy on at the actual store so here's my

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.429 
buy on at the actual store so here's my
third<00:01:49.500> book<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:54.439> student

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
third book right here it is student

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.469 
third book right here it is student
solution<00:01:56.420> manual<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> second

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
solution manual so it's a the second

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
solution manual so it's a the second
part<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.259> type<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> math<00:02:03.140> textbook<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
part to the type or the math textbook so

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.950 
part to the type or the math textbook so
I<00:02:05.490> haven't<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.299> looked<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.750> one

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
I haven't really looked at this one

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
I haven't really looked at this one
apparently<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> solutions

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
apparently it's just all the solutions

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.350 
apparently it's just all the solutions
oh<00:02:09.270> yeah<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.289> goes<00:02:10.319> step<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:10.709> step<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:12.180> each

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
oh yeah it goes step by step for each

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.530 
oh yeah it goes step by step for each
question<00:02:12.810> step

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
question step

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.809 
question step
my<00:02:13.599> step<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.019> how<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.260> solve<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.829> this<00:02:15.579> will<00:02:15.790> be

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
my step of how to solve it this will be

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.690 
my step of how to solve it this will be
useful<00:02:16.950> I'll<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.129> cool

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
useful I'll be cool

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.809 
useful I'll be cool
I'll<00:02:19.359> be<00:02:19.629> able<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.930> actually<00:02:20.109> see<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.670> do

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
I'll be able to actually see what to do

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.360 
I'll be able to actually see what to do
and<00:02:22.090> how<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.359> fix<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.409> if<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.799> it<00:02:23.890> wrong

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
and how to fix it if I get it wrong

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.910 
and how to fix it if I get it wrong
um<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.239> total<00:02:29.049> all<00:02:29.290> together<00:02:29.620> on

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
um and then so total all together on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.069 
um and then so total all together on
these<00:02:30.189> three<00:02:30.670> books<00:02:30.939> plus<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.510> chemistry

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
these three books plus the chemistry

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.399 
these three books plus the chemistry
book<00:02:32.319> which<00:02:33.159> was<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.370> lot<00:02:33.609> more<00:02:33.989> but<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
book which was a lot more but just the

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.910 
book which was a lot more but just the
three<00:02:35.650> books<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.159> spent<00:02:37.799> 162<00:02:38.799> bucks<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.709> yeah

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
three books I spent 162 bucks so yeah

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.220 
three books I spent 162 bucks so yeah
this<00:02:42.639> was<00:02:42.819> actually<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.450> first<00:02:43.599> time<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.079> got

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
this was actually the first time I got

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.449 
this was actually the first time I got
to<00:02:44.500> use<00:02:44.799> my<00:02:45.420> card

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
to use my card
