00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.919
 good morning and welcome back today we will prepare 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.509
 a quick recipe and let's start with rice 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.090
 that we cooked the other time if you 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.350
 remember we ended up saying that me 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.660
 usually it prepares a little more 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.970
 just to have the availability in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.010
 refrigerator when I get home late e 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.210
 today, in short, we work, we all arrive 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 almost all at home late 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.989
 so I'm here or some long brown rice 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 long type and already cooked then the others 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 Today's ingredients are croissants and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.549
 of almonds is a very fast recipe 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.019
 and very easy 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.030
 before I started I wanted to say something 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.199
 important right now we are 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.549
 entering the summer season e 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.500
 of jewelry that really does a lot 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.610
 hot 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.710
 so we have to balance with 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 the external environment and we must try to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 make you prepare meals that you 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 keep cool inside 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.630
 we try to use less fire 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.579
 then through quick cooking 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 skipped steamed is fine 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.650
 but above all we try to eat a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.080
 food that does n't overheat us here or gods 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 I washed and sprinkled them and there 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.310
 I'm going to burn igniting the water by doing 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 sorry fire I wanted to turn on 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.690
 water because it's really hot actually 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.590
 when it boils we salt the water and then there 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.140
 we throw in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 just the time to cook then 45 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.520
 minutes not many that are cooked but 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 crunchy meanwhile I take the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 almonds that are another food 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.210
 very important they are very rich of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.590
 we are going to chop up essential oils 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.590
 even roughly 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.409
 another advice I give you is that of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.850
 clean the knife and cutting board first 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.619
 to switch to vegetable cutting 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.789
 next or any other food 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.420
 following 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.460
 this practice allows us to maintain 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.590
 integrates today's energy 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.410
 food I generally also feel 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.540
 separated when we prepare 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.360
 the final dish we put together all the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.770
 energies of the foods we have burned and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.770
 sauteed cooked somehow 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.620
 we take the croissants and cut them to 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.620
 small pieces diagonally 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.860
 sesame oil is not so much 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.310
 interesting very rich in fat 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.120
 polyunsaturated when we make fried food 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.460
 definitely an oil to keep in 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.400
 consideration compared to others or them 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.430
 let's put in the rice so let's start 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.430
 to 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:06.900
 write a string of broth for cooking 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.900
 croissants soaps with a bit of tamari 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.080
 and add the collars 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:20.010
 it's wonderful to see the colors too 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:23.090
 we must try to keep them alive and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.090
 let's go to piazza king 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:35.000
 and over them we put a little bit of almonds 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.230
 which we previously roasted 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.239
 and here in five minutes we have 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.890
 prepared a first course I wanted 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.819
 summarize a moment of importance 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.680
 of the ingredients 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.220
 we used brown rice 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.319
 we know to be an important food 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.329
 as an anti-inflammatory but not only 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.980
 it is very rich in fiber and fiber 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.879
 we know it's very important for the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.639
 our intestines 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.129
 we used croissants but croissants 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.989
 simply because they are in season 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.849
 the other important ingredient instead 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.129
 they are almonds that are very rich 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.129
 essential fats of essential oils 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.769
 when I skipped it, I introduced you 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.359
 sesame oil is an oil that 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.609
 certainly not part of ours 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.039
 tradition but I advise you to know it 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.380
 at high temperatures and releases one 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.329
 called antioxidant substance 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.370
 extended pier at high temperature and not 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.949
 I mean 200 degrees and when we warm it up 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.780
 simply and is very high in fat 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.090
 polyunsaturated follows you put it in 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.430
 refrigerator does not condense as instead 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.409
 condense and other oils 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.030
 of the order of the universe and awaits you 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.990
 I recommend the next recipe 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.990
 cook with love 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.100
 no
