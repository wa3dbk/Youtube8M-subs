00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.880
 redone because unfortunately I have no time in 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.860
 this moment to create new things but 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.750
 however, these are things that I had already created 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.359
 a little while ago and seeing me 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.310

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.860

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.430
 hotmail.it 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.340
 and anyway we talk and talk to each other 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.890
 you can ask what it is that lived 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.300
 ok that said let's start right away then 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.539
 this is an order he made for one 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.729
 race and I think there are a lot of things 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.149
 beautiful and first of all reborn this 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.070
 necklace that as you can see is very bright 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.770
 now I put it up here has nothing to do with it 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.080
 nothing with me with how I'm dressed but 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.850
 however it is simply to make you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.700
 see with me these five plates 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.729
 which are embroidered with chain 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.040
 svarowsky of the black crystals also one 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.430
 white natural stone and drops e 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.040
 in crystal but as you see very bright 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.670
 very elegant prices certainly like 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.530
 always I put them in the Info box and that's it 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.990
 simply go there and you will find 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.350
 all the information both for what 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.380
 it's about my page for both prices 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.390
 and what I can do in short times ok 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.920
 then paired with this necklace she has me 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.860
 Ordered earrings I never have 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.979
 fact that these would be here go to 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.570
 lobe are not very large in quality 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.100
 but they are very bright and in any case 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.320
 recall and in the same reason as the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.549
 however these necklace are of the installment 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.489
 black a white bead and a stone 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.420
 white in the natural center that thinks it will be 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.010
 quartz 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.840
 and then around the swarovski chain 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.239
 as much as embroidered and go 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.190
 directly to the man 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.870
 then another column she ordered is 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.630
 this here and also these black bed 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.270
 this is practically a version 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.430
 little one because I didn't make two 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.260
 much bigger than up here 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.709
 maybe if I'm not mistaken that even some 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.340
 swarovski and that for example cost 35 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.230
 this one is 25 and is smaller than a 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.019
 crystallis com also with natural stones 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.580
 this would be a mine and new installment 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.230
 brass aluminum chains and that's it 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.930
 and it's quite stiff as you see 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.850
 this can even go up again 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.030
 it can also come down again because how 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.920
 always leave a little more and chain 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.280
 so if you still want it longer 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.019
 you can then do it again 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.750
 he also ordered me some earrings 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.790
 But I've never done these are facts 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.910
 affixed just for her that they would be 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.560
 these kennels and me to make you see again 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.090
 I should be hair because 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.420
 otherwise it cannot be seen 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.700
 ok almost see they are golden made in 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.340
 aluminum brass and black fatah 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.250
 crystals in the form of drop that 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.959
 those the dishes that call them means 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.049
 crystals I don't even know how it is 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.930
 still call these things are so 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.120
 and they are very cute they are beautiful rich 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.079
 below are full 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.220
 in this it is the thing I like 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:49.190
 surely then again for another 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.870
 girl again I have redone this necklace 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.850
 some very summer and I like it a lot 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.700
 first of all because the materials are 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.260
 there are many beautiful natural stones 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.299
 here because there is both amethyst and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.090
 it would be this purple stone then there is 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.880
 also fluorite that this green water 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.239
 very clear and then there is this that a 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.819
 Fourth very nice blue 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.590
 as you can see this is how this can be 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.750
 wear it either because in any case a 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.340
 several children in the chain also i 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.979
 transparent crystals that still give 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.820
 more light or if it can twist 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.180
 all and in my opinion the effect is still 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.160
 more elegant 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.650
 and it comes like this is beautiful, very beautiful 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.250
 very elegant summer you can wear 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.039
 be a day for the day so that 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.740
 also for the occasion certainly a little 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.259
 more particular something like that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.479
 then I redid it goes well this already 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:56.190
 you saw it in a very last video 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.900
 beautiful she also asked for it then 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.340
 necklace in the air that you have already seen the 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.289
 column with the chains you already have 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.720
 view then I also did this thing 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.820
 this necklace for this other girl 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.259
 which is also made this in stones for a 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.349
 slopes this stone is very particular 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:14.190
 because you see it is all colored throughout 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:16.849
 different in color like blue and that goes 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.820
 but a little darker a little lighter 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.410
 on fuchsia on orange it is very beautiful 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.020
 very particular very much 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.639
 I really like her very much 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.639
 I have always redone these kippahs 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.870
 this envelope because I had it has them 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.000
 Bestsellers 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.610
 then I had to do it again and look 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.530
 how beautiful they are beautiful 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:49.080
 I think I did it again 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.030
 these earrings that would be 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.260
 those that I had done a little on the tones 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.630
 of the big column I made you 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.830
 see first however these are 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.199
 some to a plate hours in call 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.570
 to the lobe and have all this strong like this 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.460
 tending and also have platelets 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.370
 round that also give a little light to the 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.900
 I move everything and I like them very much 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.940
 I am very nice in my opinion too 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.919
 these very beautiful summer ones that 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.470
 this girl in particular ordered 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:17.669
 together with the bracelet if I think 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.729
 that she will limit and match and trade 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.470
 this is also this of the amethyst 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.440
 here in the center there is a row made with 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.300
 amatista flowers and azure port and a 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.729
 wire of 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.060
 ascends does not make it even brighter 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.830
 then again I did these too 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.110
 earrings that I think are beautiful 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.990
 look how beautiful they are a lot 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.069
 very simple but very very elegant 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:47.090
 beautiful and this for example the piece 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:49.159
 Lapis lazuli a very beautiful stone 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.509
 in the shape of a crushed drop and also 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:56.270
 this little ball and lapis lazuli then I have 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:07:01.190
 also made this other necklace that a 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.719
 other rinne also this that you have seen 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.639
 I also have this name in other colors 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:07.699
 never seen it before because it had been 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.710
 request for a girl bye minio 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.629
 enzo darling she had asked me this 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.289
 necklace and then this guy at the sight 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:18.319
 and she ordered this too 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.770
 here that has all these embroidered plates 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.379
 by hand 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.310
 I always remind you this is a 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:24.620
 big job 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.330
 it takes a long time to succeed in 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.940
 do something like that anyway 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.669
 embroidered with swarovski chain in this 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.779
 case there is a suitable black there are some pearls 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:38.060
 of river that go kind on the gray and that 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:41.599
 they are a bit iridescent and actually and then 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:45.560

 that the red handled sandoval and I write 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.879
 close because otherwise it is too much 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.349
 complicated to say it is always max 

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.779
 surely because you know we are 

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:09.430
