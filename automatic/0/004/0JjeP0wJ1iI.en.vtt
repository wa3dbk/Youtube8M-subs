00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.969
 Welcome to mechanical 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.469
 wristwatches 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.179
 I'll show you the one today 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.520
 mechanical wristwatch raises and the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.290
 newspaper has the date here 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 I post a mail in front of me 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.730
 automatic model with one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 screwed crown screwed 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.400
 crown has three positions in the first 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 position is the crown screwed around 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.150
 then come to the second position 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.699
 we just have to open the crown 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.989
 screw 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.400
 when we have the crown screwed on 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 we can now raise the clock 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.910
 that happens with about 20 to 30 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.620
 half turns you have the clock 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.329
 can be raised directly from the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.950
 second position in the first again 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.350
 change simply by the crown 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.690
 but you still want to enter the time 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 or the date must change the crown 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 be brought into the third position 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.070
 in the third position one comes by 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.840
 you only change to the second position 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.750
 and then with a small effort 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.220
 the crown pulls you out 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 that you are in the third position 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.570
 when you see that the hours and hours 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.159
 Now you can move the minute hand 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.540
 the hour hand so long in the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.549
 to move clockwise 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.549
 until the date has changed once 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.799
 when the date has changed 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.250
 turn counterclockwise 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:35.310
 back to about half past seven now 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.140
 we'll cry again until 12 o'clock 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 and remember that the date will turn that way 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.829
 That means you do not always have to jump 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.600
 make two full turns with that 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.250
 date around peace but in everyone 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.869
 shortened variant is something 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.340
 more quickly 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.590
 We 're about to go the hour hand 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.899
 to eight back for the reason that if 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.450
 you look at the date in more detail 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.649
 and when turning back the hour hand 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.930
 that is, if we are against the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 Turn clockwise 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.820
 Watch this closely then you see 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.490
 that date at about 9 o'clock 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.680
 slightly raises and now you turn 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.750
 about an hour back 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.759
 thus the mechanics 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.890
 does not need to be damaged then you can 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.330
 turn the clock again and thus 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.620
 easily set the date is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.360
 the crown in the third position 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.550
 you realize that these are pretty loose 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.710
 this is normal and above all else 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.330
 wanted it comes therefore that the crown 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.790
 with a paint pen with the mechanism 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.350
 connected by the fact that the crown is so 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.180
 sitting loosely becomes a uniform 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.880
 pressure distribution on the seal 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.610
 allows for an improved 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.110
 Waterproofness leads the way 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.270
 a mechanism with automatic function 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.250
 this is for example a rotor installed 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.920
 is when this moves the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.330
 raised as mentioned may 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.300
 Do not cover the spring 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.830
 that's because they just do not 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.930
 firmly anchored in the factory 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.209
 that is when the clock is just too much 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.820
 is raised, the spring jumps on 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.370
 and will not overstretch it 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.950
 can run properly for 30 hours without 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.570
 additional movement from this circa 30 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.400
 half revolutions are raised 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.430
 to take the clock from the best of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.110
 Wrist and pull her up so not 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.100
 in addition to exerting pressure on the crown 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.750
 We also recommend you the clock 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.850
 every day if you pull this 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.560
 Do not wear it like this though 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.780
 Often, that means the watch carries a lot 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.230
 being in motion is raising every day 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.820
 not necessarily i hope 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.350
 Our tips were helpful to you 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.350
 and wish you a lot of fun with the clock
