three years it can play bejeweled blitz

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.350 
three years it can play bejeweled blitz
but<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.979> laggy<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:12.030> really

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
but it's a little laggy I was really

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.300

surprised

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
surprised

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.710

this phone didn't come with any
bloatware<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.709> thought<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.250> was<00:02:16.370> just<00:02:16.490> gonna<00:02:16.610> be

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
bloatware I thought it was just gonna be

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.010 
bloatware I thought it was just gonna be
filled<00:02:17.150> with<00:02:17.240> crap

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
filled with crap

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.750 
filled with crap
I<00:02:18.050> thought<00:02:18.410> freedompop<00:02:18.950> was<00:02:19.280> gonna<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.610> the

net zero of mobile phones offering you
free<00:02:22.880> service<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.540> then<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.319> had<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.500> watch<00:02:24.770> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
free service but then you had to watch a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.800 
free service but then you had to watch a
bunch<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.280> ads<00:02:25.550> on<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.940> bottom<00:02:26.270> that's<00:02:26.600> what<00:02:26.780> I

anyway<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.620> my<00:03:12.769> old<00:03:12.980> phone<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.400> would<00:03:13.580> turn<00:03:13.790> off

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
anyway on my old phone I would turn off

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.740 
anyway on my old phone I would turn off
mobile<00:03:14.269> data<00:03:14.660> Wi-Fi<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:16.069> it<00:03:16.940> would<00:03:17.120> save<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
mobile data Wi-Fi and it would save the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.289 
mobile data Wi-Fi and it would save the
battery<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.890> much<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.400> could<00:03:19.579> use<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.940> for<00:03:19.970> days

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299

it<00:03:23.000> with<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.420> phone<00:03:23.720> but<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.440> can't<00:03:24.769> do<00:03:24.950> that

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
it with this phone but you can't do that

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.729 
it with this phone but you can't do that
because<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.670> need<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.480> mobile<00:03:26.870> data<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:28.269> get

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
because you need the mobile data to get

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.229 
because you need the mobile data to get
phone<00:03:30.739> calls<00:03:31.000> unfortunately<00:03:32.000> at<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> moment
