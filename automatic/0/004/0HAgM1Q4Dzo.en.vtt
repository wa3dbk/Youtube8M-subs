00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 still not sure where to go safely 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.080
 find yourself rivals for match one 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.269
 on one or team per team and not 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.780
 just like that and play for example at 100 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.780
 rubles 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.020
 We argue on point com your guarantor number 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 one in the world of eSports hi 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 you watch your maracasi 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 jokes and bugs issue 34 so let's start here 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.420
 from such a fun moment three arts three 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.300
 barrels vyeno for some reason 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.790
 stuck to his ally who however 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.489
 Strange, too, plays on arte 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 and they do not give him peace do not give to drive 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 and it is not clear why they do this can 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.090
 be they also do not like art as everyone 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 and here at m53 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.039
 still exhausted patience destroys 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.629
 absolutely everyone even pigeons and 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.410
 it was certainly funny that he 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.730
 delivered and especially a lot of emotions 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 adversary who are happy 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.189
 victorious battle E25 doing smart 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 position and starts shooting t29 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.740
 which stands in before the wiki and here is an American 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 still I went ahead but crashes into 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.380
 a slide and some funny tank happens 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 t29 turns around and he starts to go 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 straight towards the water and falls there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.689
 It looks like this E25 has moved to the dark 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.689
 side and he has now such 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.070
 abilities like telekinesis he can tanks 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.229
 move and direct their side of the water and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.500
 plus more in the side of course easier to punch 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.560
 next we will have the most epic ricochet 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.310
 which I 've ever seen st-1 shoots 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.430
 and the projectile flies away from the tower t-43 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.579
 and kills the allies of the tiger who stood 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.030
 by the way very far and at the same time have a tiger 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.240
 it was full hp ie bk exploded 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.119
 look at how far there is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 how could the projectile and you fly on this 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 distance y and kill allies catch i 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.480
 I just don't understand it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.360
 the tiger seems to have pulled this shell like 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.840
 magnet him of course not very much 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.150
 lucky he didn't expect it and not to 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.629
 there was an enemy standing 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.700
 kill an ally some players me so 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.980
 very surprised I just do not understand how 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.050
 they do it like gallows for example 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.360
 what is this christmas tree you see what she 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.209
 gets up she jumps on her ally 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.459
 and jumps on it like a springboard 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.690
 here it of course receives 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.900
 the fun of the game 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.720
 riding around the allies here if yes 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.239
 lucky then that should be those who are very 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.670
 not very lucky here for example borschik 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.629
 starts to go out heels the opponent 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 and shoots but the projectile flies past this 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.519
 Fri sau he gets into some small 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.310
 hole and in the end damage and fails 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.459
 cause this is not luck but here 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.709
 The reverse situation is going E100 for some reason on 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.550
 just in case and charges the high-explosive projectile 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:15.659
 and on the move shoots and punches high-explosive 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.269
 projectile t69 which for some reason is kind 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.060
 framed the board out and here for example kv-2 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.970
 begins to howl follow drying and get 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.670
 it’s just unrealistic here but apt-2 shoots and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.519
 the projectile flies right through that window and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.700
 picks up the full isu-152 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.879
 but if yes it is not luck then 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.540
 well, then we will have another very 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:42.290
 cool moment t67 goes for drying rams 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.720
 her and at the same moment shoots apt-1 and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.950
 destroys the poor wrote that just 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.269
 became a victim and coincidence 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.180
 of course the running may not be 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 it was necessary but in any case very 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.269
 cool moment is just incredible 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.360
 around one cheaters shoots at one 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.880
 the side 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.950
 projectile flies and then still falls 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.590
 as an opponent you just look at 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.920
 this chitaka as you can play at all 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.160
 what a horror incredibly shoots one 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:22.170
 black prince’s side 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.350
 terrible and did you know that some players 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.840
 go to hell out of turn if they take 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.960
 platoon tank which is much higher by 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.880
 well, or vice versa, much lower 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.690
 for example this one for 1 cent 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.440
 flies underground for their sins and so 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.900
 he does not need for such things need 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:49.260
 punish all the same so fair 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:52.320
 is it okay to me or 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.750
 to leave for apt-2 board together not the most 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.190
 best idea but let's see maybe 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.180
 be it all the same 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.550
 wonderful 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.960
 two opponents leave immediately 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.500
 goes to the hangar 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.200
 Well done and you need it and you have such 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.600
 what are you standing on your powerful Soviet 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.300
 Fri-Sau and then some flea leaves 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.620
 rises as if he doesn't care and starts 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.450
 you tease you shoot and projectile one 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.210
 generally fly past and the other is not 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.360
 punches him in the turret board normally and 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.180
 finally two more awesome shots 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.000
 Apt-2 and on this all friends thanks 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.550
