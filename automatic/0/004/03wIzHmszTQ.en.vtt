going to be creating seed capsules and
they<00:00:06.750> actually<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> really<00:00:07.560> great

neighborhoods<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.639> had<00:00:14.880> fenced<00:00:15.330> off<00:00:15.450> vacant

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
neighborhoods that had fenced off vacant

neighborhoods that had fenced off vacant
lots

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
lots

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
lots
the<00:00:16.859> neighbors<00:00:17.190> wanted<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> plant

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
neighborhood what they figured out is

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.890 
neighborhood what they figured out is
that<00:00:21.990> by<00:00:22.260> combining<00:00:22.609> compost<00:00:23.609> clay<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.449> seeds

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that by combining compost clay and seeds

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
that by combining compost clay and seeds
they<00:00:25.500> were<00:00:25.650> able<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> create<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.490> capsules

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
they were able to create little capsules

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.519 
they were able to create little capsules
that<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.390> harden<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> could<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.260> tossed

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
that would harden and could be tossed

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.830 
that would harden and could be tossed
over<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> fence<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:30.000> clay<00:00:30.240> protected<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
over the fence the clay protected the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
over the fence the clay protected the
seeds<00:00:31.080> from<00:00:31.230> being<00:00:31.470> eaten<00:00:31.590> by<00:00:31.769> birds<00:00:31.949> are

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
seeds from being eaten by birds are

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400 
seeds from being eaten by birds are
being<00:00:32.610> blown<00:00:32.850> away<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> wind<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:34.230> when

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
being blown away in the wind but when

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.440 
being blown away in the wind but when
the<00:00:34.500> rains<00:00:34.739> eventually<00:00:35.340> came<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.969> capsules

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the rains eventually came the capsules

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
the rains eventually came the capsules
would<00:00:36.600> soften<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.649> compost<00:00:38.160> would

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
would soften up the compost would

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.459 
would soften up the compost would
fertilize<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.090> seeds<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.600> germinate<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
fertilize the seeds they germinate and a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
fertilize the seeds they germinate and a
plant<00:00:40.739> would<00:00:40.950> grow<00:00:41.219> they're<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.329> really

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
plant would grow they're actually really

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.060 
plant would grow they're actually really
simple<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> make<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.469> I'm<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> show<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
simple to make and I'm going to show you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.029 
simple to make and I'm going to show you
how<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> lot<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> recipes<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.440> I've<00:00:46.710> found

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
how so a lot of recipes that I've found

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.520 
how so a lot of recipes that I've found
for<00:00:47.340> seed<00:00:47.550> capsules<00:00:47.899> actually<00:00:48.899> call<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
for seed capsules actually call for a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.410 
for seed capsules actually call for a
powdered<00:00:49.950> clay<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.460> found<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> be

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
powdered clay I found this to be

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
powdered clay I found this to be
actually<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.230> hard<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> source<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
actually really hard to source but a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
actually really hard to source but a
good<00:00:53.579> substitute<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.329> air<00:00:54.660> dry<00:00:54.989> clay<00:00:55.050> which

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
good substitute is air dry clay which

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
good substitute is air dry clay which
you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.739> find<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.039> almost<00:00:56.340> any<00:00:56.610> arts<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you can find in almost any arts and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.479 
you can find in almost any arts and
crafts<00:00:57.329> store<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> begin<00:00:59.070> by

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
crafts store so we're going to begin by

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.840 
crafts store so we're going to begin by
placing<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.390> large<00:01:00.629> bowl

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
placing this in a large bowl

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
placing this in a large bowl
on<00:01:02.910> top<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.110> add<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.619> compost<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.309> your

on top of that add your compost in your

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.539 
on top of that add your compost in your
seeds<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.380> begin<00:01:07.530> needing<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> mix

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
seeds and then just begin needing to mix

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
seeds and then just begin needing to mix
it<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.820> together<00:01:11.780> once<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.960> completely

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it all together once it's completely

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
it all together once it's completely
mixed<00:01:13.770> begin<00:01:14.520> breaking<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.090> pieces<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
mixed begin breaking off pieces and you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
mixed begin breaking off pieces and you
want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> roll<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
want to roll it into about one to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
want to roll it into about one to
one-and-a-half<00:01:18.420> inch<00:01:18.840> spheres<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.979> set

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
one-and-a-half inch spheres then set

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.550 
one-and-a-half inch spheres then set
them<00:01:20.490> aside<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> flat<00:01:21.600> surface<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> dry

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
them aside on a flat surface to dry

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
them aside on a flat surface to dry
depending<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> area<00:01:24.149> you<00:01:24.509> live<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:24.869> and

the amount of humidity it'll probably

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
the amount of humidity it'll probably
take<00:01:26.789> about<00:01:26.940> one<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.600> days<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.020> dry<00:01:28.289> once
