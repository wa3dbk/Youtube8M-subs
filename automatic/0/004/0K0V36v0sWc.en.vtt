00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and so what I did is I made a set of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
and so what I did is I made a set of
stairs<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> saw<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
stairs in here and then I saw this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
stairs in here and then I saw this
little<00:01:10.020> dolly<00:01:10.260> piece<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> made<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.130> boxes

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
little dolly piece and I made some boxes

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060 
little dolly piece and I made some boxes
so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.290> worker<00:01:13.680> could<00:01:13.860> just

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so you know then a worker could just

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.399 
so you know then a worker could just
bring<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.540> load<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> into<00:01:16.259> the

truck

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.520 
truck
I<00:01:17.009> thought<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.509> cool<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950 
I thought that was pretty cool now you
simply<00:01:19.890> set<00:01:20.280> those<00:01:20.460> stairs<00:01:20.820> back<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.780> there

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
simply set those stairs back in there

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.109 
simply set those stairs back in there
close<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> top<00:01:25.860> back<00:01:26.280> on

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.620 
close it up and I put the top back on
