00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
Complex and also behind that door is

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.840 
Complex and also behind that door is
there's<00:00:16.650> agador<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> left<00:00:17.310> there's<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
there's agador to the left there's a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120 
there's agador to the left there's a
passkey<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.480> I'll<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.590> some<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:19.949> time

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
passkey is I'll show that some one time

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.830 
passkey is I'll show that some one time
yeah<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:20.699> at<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> beginning<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.180> it's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
yeah right at the beginning that it's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.570 
yeah right at the beginning that it's
impossible<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.039> miss<00:00:23.130> because<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.430> part<00:00:23.550> of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
impossible to miss because it's part of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.970 
impossible to miss because it's part of
the<00:00:23.670> story<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:24.869> where<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.769> one

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the story but that's where the first one

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.470 
the story but that's where the first one
is<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.279> guess<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> counts<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> grenade<00:00:27.269> pack

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
is I guess it counts as a grenade pack

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660 
is I guess it counts as a grenade pack
as<00:00:27.689> well<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.680> second<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.429> here

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670

and as good knees back number four you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.200 
and as good knees back number four you
can<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.100> these<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> different<00:01:20.700> order<00:01:20.850> -<00:01:21.030> it's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
can do these in a different order - it's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.640 
can do these in a different order - it's
not<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.570> numbered<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.409> just

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
not like them numbered but it's just

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.920 
not like them numbered but it's just
kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> locations<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> help<00:01:24.750> you
