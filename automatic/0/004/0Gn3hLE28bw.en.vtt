including you Eliot are telling me that
that<00:00:53.489> may<00:00:53.760> lead<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> overtraining<00:00:54.809> what's<00:00:55.350> up

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
that may lead to overtraining what's up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
that may lead to overtraining what's up
am<00:00:57.090> i<00:00:57.300> adapting<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.829> don't

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
am i adapting to this so that I don't

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
am i adapting to this so that I don't
overtrain<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.840> should<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:01.109> off<00:01:01.379> because

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
overtrain or should I back off because

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
overtrain or should I back off because
everybody<00:01:02.010> else<00:01:02.160> says<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.430> should<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
everybody else says I should so the the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.539 
everybody else says I should so the the
way<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.379> answer<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> question<00:01:04.799> first

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
way I would answer that question first

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
way I would answer that question first
of<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.390> rely<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:07.140> own<00:01:07.200> experience

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
of all is to rely on your own experience

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
of all is to rely on your own experience
right<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.000> apparently<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.140> getting

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
right so apparently if you're getting

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.780 
right so apparently if you're getting
stronger<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.070> feeling<00:01:11.460> good<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
stronger and you're feeling good and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
stronger and you're feeling good and
you're<00:01:11.909> training<00:01:12.330> six<00:01:12.600> days<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> week<00:01:12.930> your

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you're training six days a week your

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.550 
you're training six days a week your
body<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.369> handle<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.210> also

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
body can handle that we are also

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.240 
body can handle that we are also
different<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:17.130> me<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> give<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.930> advice

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
different for me to give you advice

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.460 
different for me to give you advice
based<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:20.729> experience<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> contradicts

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
based on my experience if it contradicts

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.859 
based on my experience if it contradicts
everything<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> you've<00:01:23.460> experienced<00:01:24.299> would

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
everything that you've experienced would

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
everything that you've experienced would
be<00:01:25.020> unfair<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:26.310> why<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> go

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
be unfair that's why we all have to go

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
be unfair that's why we all have to go
out<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.600> our<00:01:27.750> own<00:01:27.780> thing<00:01:27.930> these<00:01:28.770> videos

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.740 
out and do our own thing these videos
that<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> videos<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> you

all<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.920> different<00:02:13.280> thoughts<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:14.090> all

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
all have different thoughts we all

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.080 
all have different thoughts we all
approach<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.440> thing<00:02:15.890> called<00:02:16.160> life<00:02:16.370> very

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
approach this thing called life very

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.310 
approach this thing called life very
differently<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.570> we're<00:02:17.780> all<00:02:17.870> coming<00:02:18.050> from<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
differently and we're all coming from a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.440 
differently and we're all coming from a
different<00:02:18.500> place<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.070> all<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.240> do<00:02:20.330> is

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
different place so all we can do is

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.710 
different place so all we can do is
share<00:02:20.930> that's<00:02:21.650> what<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:21.950> here<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.640> share<00:02:23.300> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
share that's what I do here is share and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.550 
share that's what I do here is share and
I<00:02:24.530> would<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.550> wrong<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.850> tell<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.690> hey

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
I would be wrong to tell you that hey

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.900 
I would be wrong to tell you that hey
dude<00:02:27.830> you're<00:02:27.920> getting<00:02:28.130> great<00:02:28.220> results<00:02:28.430> but

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
dude you're getting great results but

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.010 
dude you're getting great results but
you<00:02:29.120> shouldn't<00:02:29.690> do<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:29.990> right<00:02:31.090> okay<00:02:32.090> so

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
you shouldn't do that right okay so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.020 
you shouldn't do that right okay so
that's<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.070> very<00:02:34.220> first<00:02:34.280> thing<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.670> second

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's the very first thing the second

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.360 
that's the very first thing the second

thing is that to train that long over
that<00:02:40.489> period<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:41.030> time<00:02:41.270> is<00:02:41.660> very<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:43.700> very

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
that period of time is very it's very

he's great everything is going well I'm

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.170 
he's great everything is going well I'm
pretty<00:03:09.170> sure<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.580> taken<00:03:10.940> some<00:03:11.150> time

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
pretty sure that it's taken some time

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.720 
pretty sure that it's taken some time
but<00:03:11.570> his<00:03:11.690> body's<00:03:12.019> adapted<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.920> volume<00:03:13.580> of

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.300 
but his body's adapted to that volume of
activity<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.380> quite<00:03:15.530> possible<00:03:16.010> there

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
activity so it's quite possible there

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.890 
activity so it's quite possible there
are<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> lot<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.519> careers<00:03:16.940> there<00:03:17.690> are<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> lot<00:03:17.870> of

college right so all of that stress adds
to<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.880> overload<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.329> would<00:04:08.450> be<00:04:08.570> associated

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
to the overload that would be associated

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.140 
to the overload that would be associated
with<00:04:09.320> burdening<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.430> nervous<00:04:10.699> system<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.090> the

would be a mess but it's because I have
more<00:04:58.260> cumulative<00:04:59.100> stressors<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.810> that's<00:05:00.930> it
