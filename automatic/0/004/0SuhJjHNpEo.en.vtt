00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and somehow that worked out but it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.260 
and somehow that worked out but it's
definitely<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.890> common<00:00:56.760> anymore

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
definitely not common anymore

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
definitely not common anymore
especially<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.230> our<00:00:58.350> age<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.769> like<00:00:59.280> our

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
especially in our age you know like our

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.759 
especially in our age you know like our
generation<00:00:59.870> isn't<00:01:00.870> gonna<00:01:01.110> get<00:01:01.230> married<00:01:01.379> until

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
generation isn't gonna get married until

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.009 
generation isn't gonna get married until
we're<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.010> 30<00:01:02.280> instead<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.970> like<00:01:03.150> 18<00:01:03.570> which

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
we're like 30 instead of like 18 which

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
we're like 30 instead of like 18 which
is<00:01:04.050> why<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.320> used<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.860> common<00:01:05.070> anyway

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
is why it used to be more common anyway

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.530 
is why it used to be more common anyway
I<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:09.330> bit
