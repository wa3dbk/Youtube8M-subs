 she transformed the essay with a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.080
 show that is both feminist and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.540
 misogynist 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.030
 success I get there 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.199
 it's a sacred what happened to you 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.609
 because we were both talking to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.989
 maquis at just now there are five 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.010
 years I was here in France 2 but not everything 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.500
 in fact in the same functions 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 no I was hostess at 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.860
 the welcome here I took the cards 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 identity I was calling for sir 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 so- and- so everything I was doing there a little 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.850
 work next to the outstanding land by 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 year during your studies 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.340
 there is something that is really 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.420
 give a boost we can say 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220
 it's your passages at laurent ruquier 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.759
 that's what made you aware of 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.799
 General public 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.000
 this is the game was already spinning with a 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.290
 first show for several 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 years and here I was doing small 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.299
 cafes theaters it worked well and the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 go on tv at laurent ruquier that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.869
 really boosted it was a stepping stone 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.119
 amazing for this new what you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.350
 have made fifty-one passage at 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.579
 laurent ruquier until you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.619
 decided to stop it was a 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.960
 crazy pressure also it took every 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 times we see it on the images invent 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.149
 a new character I see you again 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.500
 also that each time we change 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.540
 costume on the character you 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.649
 really invent something and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.689
 quickly felt was a little 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.030
 strong 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.430
 the first seven in question judge 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.320
 and note etc and that's the end I was 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.360
 more in the pleasure but here I was 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.650
 very happy to have made 51 passage 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540
 sacred performance 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.790
 in any case the general public has you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.320
 discovery thanks to that we see the images 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 that are sometimes staggering from vaud 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840
 transformation let's talk about your 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.390
 show 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.280
 the mayors are hiding to die is this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.340
 it's a show about the desperate 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.370
 housewife on the cracking varnish it's 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.800
 this is trash version but it's 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.870
 really about the appearances on the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.660
 women and and what's going on 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.769
 when the nail polish goes away and we 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.050
 really see what's underneath 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.120
 the real personality and the crackings 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.080
 so it's you who say trash because 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.269
 that you go there anyway in the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.890
 show downright clearly is the 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.780
 public love it they ask for more 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.340
 you surprised it was is what it is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.959
 that paradoxically we are too 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.760
 politically correct today and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.450
 so we need a show 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.819
 who go after 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.290
 I am convinced that there is a there is a 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.930
 politically incorrect side that is 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.519
 necessary and who is liberating 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.870
 so I say lots of bastard stuff 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.130
 makes me feel good and people get married 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.870
 and here they are crazy they are a little embarrassed 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.030
 so it's kind of like that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.709
 but at the same time it's good we're going 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.540
 immediately see an excerpt from your 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.060
 show with that very funny where you 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.130
 play as a school nurse who 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.049
 does a sex education class at 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.790
 teenagers but a short as one 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:17.780
 could say a little bit special 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.780
 because of the musical chairs 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:27.320
 firstly am I ready 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.320
 that is to say Swiss settlement and 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.750
 second is what the ideal lute 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:52.840
 it was often that nobody 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:59.680
 beats 7h06 mark three tries hand 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:03.579
 what was your name 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:10.630
 protect if the new aesthetic jules 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:12.220
 viette constant earphones it's you who 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.769
 say it's both a show 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.160
 feminist and misogynist explain us 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.690
 so I think to be two opposites actually 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.220
 it's like I have a pretty physical 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.610
 sweet and 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.980
 angeli this is a beautiful December is here and 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.720
 and that I say atrocious things is 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.980
 really two opposites who that's who 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.660
 compete and this show is 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.730
 really really that is that 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.580
 characters here is composed of opposing 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.900
 and indulge here is an explosive mix 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.210
 even explosive 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.890
 we saw it both in the excerpts 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.960
 that we broadcast from laurent ruquier but 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.150
 this is also the case on 7 you love in 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.500
 does you transform you disguise yourself 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.270
 to disguise it means what does it mean to you 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.380
 hide behind your characters or that 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.820
 means that you have a real desire 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.760
 to drown in so much that you 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.110
 make it possible for his liberators to be 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.310
 all people at once and 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.810
 especially to say all that was not the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.040
 right to say in real life 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.330
 maybe in life I'm from 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.400
 blow I'm shy and I do not say big 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.140
 thing and lacerated by a stall cern 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.850
 suddenly after the characters this is the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.180
 total freedom and that's all I can 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.400
 to allow it is absolutely liberating 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.380
 I imagine that there you live a year 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.120
 quite extraordinary because your 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.500
