00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
so glad that there's parks like ethylene

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.110 
so glad that there's parks like ethylene
that<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:12.440> realize<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.460> worth<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.940> to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
that that realize that it's worth it to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.510 
that that realize that it's worth it to
spend<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.660> extra<00:03:14.690> money<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:16.070> build<00:03:16.280> a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
spend the extra money to to build a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.850 
spend the extra money to to build a
story<00:03:17.030> around<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.810> ride<00:03:18.020> because<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.560> think

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
story around a ride because I think

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.950 
story around a ride because I think
ultimately<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.640> like<00:03:19.910> that's<00:03:20.420> what<00:03:20.720> makes

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
ultimately that's like that's what makes

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.050 
ultimately that's like that's what makes
it<00:03:21.140> interesting<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.830> go<00:03:22.010> visit<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.550> park<00:03:22.910> again
