the<00:01:38.940> only<00:01:39.120> problem<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.020> believe<00:01:40.260> me<00:01:40.410> I'm

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the only problem and believe me I'm

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.410 
the only problem and believe me I'm
nitpicking<00:01:40.800> when<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> say<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:41.940> was<00:01:42.210> kind

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
nitpicking when I say this is I was kind

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.570 
nitpicking when I say this is I was kind
of<00:01:42.510> bothered<00:01:42.900> at<00:01:43.020> first<00:01:43.320> by<00:01:43.590> dippers<00:01:44.550> voice

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
of bothered at first by dippers voice

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.550 
of bothered at first by dippers voice
because<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.330> didn't<00:01:45.480> really<00:01:45.600> match<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:45.990> 12

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
because it didn't really match the 12

because it didn't really match the 12
year<00:01:46.770> old<00:01:46.890> character<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.640> believe<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.390> john

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
year old character I believe it's john

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.350

ritter son voicing him but after a while

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
ritter son voicing him but after a while
it<00:01:51.630> does<00:01:51.870> grow<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:53.550> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it does grow on you so it's not really a
