and you know I had to make sure I get to
my<00:01:20.850> job<00:01:20.880> made<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> nice<00:01:21.869> catch<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
my job made a nice catch and then I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
my job made a nice catch and then I
didn't<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.940> tackle<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:24.750> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
didn't really see the tackle and then I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
didn't really see the tackle and then I
guess<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.219> once<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:26.969> from<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
guess when I once I got up from the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.480 
guess when I once I got up from the
tackle<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> noticed<00:01:28.079> my<00:01:28.200> foot<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.159> aching

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
tackle I noticed my foot kind of aching

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
tackle I noticed my foot kind of aching

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
so that's kind of how I figured oh no

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.660 
so that's kind of how I figured oh no
not<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.310> again

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
