00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.300 
I think it's still a little hot grandma
how'd<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> jellyfish<00:03:26.010> oh<00:03:28.310> okay

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
how'd you like the jellyfish oh okay

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.060 
how'd you like the jellyfish oh okay
it's<00:03:29.670> okay<00:03:32.000> how'd<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.710> it<00:03:34.710> wasn't

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
it's okay how'd you like it it wasn't

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.430 
it's okay how'd you like it it wasn't
bad<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.700> certainly<00:03:36.240> wasn't<00:03:36.480> bad<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.200> was

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
bad it certainly wasn't bad but I was

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.410 
bad it certainly wasn't bad but I was
expecting<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.130> be<00:03:38.250> warmer<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.180> think

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
expecting it to be warmer and I think

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.450 
expecting it to be warmer and I think
that's<00:03:39.600> maybe<00:03:39.990> more<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.410> what<00:03:40.650> my<00:03:40.830> taste<00:03:41.100> let

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
that's maybe more of what my taste let

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.880 
that's maybe more of what my taste let
the<00:03:41.610> shark<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.030> usually<00:03:42.540> served<00:03:42.750> cold<00:03:43.050> yeah<00:03:43.560> I

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
the shark is usually served cold yeah I

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.710 
the shark is usually served cold yeah I
mean<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.490> makes<00:03:44.640> sense<00:03:44.760> now<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.180> I've<00:03:45.480> tried

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
mean it makes sense now that I've tried

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.220 
mean it makes sense now that I've tried
it<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.520> know<00:03:47.670> not<00:03:48.270> horrible<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:49.050> to
