smash it when you're doing that when

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.270 
smash it when you're doing that when
your<00:00:59.600> fingers<00:01:00.110> or<00:01:00.320> if<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:00.500> fingers<00:01:00.920> are<00:01:01.070> going

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
your fingers or if I fingers are going

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.250 
your fingers or if I fingers are going
on<00:01:01.399> there<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:02.120> can<00:01:02.270> feel<00:01:02.480> if<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:02.840> unlevel

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
on there you can feel if it's unlevel

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.209 
on there you can feel if it's unlevel
and<00:01:03.500> if<00:01:03.800> it's<00:01:03.980> on<00:01:04.159> level<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:05.269> tiny<00:01:06.139> bit<00:01:06.439> they

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
and if it's on level a tiny bit they

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.300 
and if it's on level a tiny bit they
come<00:01:07.459> out<00:01:07.639> and<00:01:07.850> they<00:01:08.240> all<00:01:08.389> get<00:01:08.600> measured<00:01:08.899> again

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
come out and they all get measured again

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.529 
come out and they all get measured again
so<00:01:10.310> once<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.670> do<00:01:10.819> this<00:01:10.999> we<00:01:11.420> have<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:13.509> take<00:01:14.509> a

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
so once we do this we have that take a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.580 
so once we do this we have that take a
spatula<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:17.389> cake<00:01:17.719> has<00:01:17.929> been<00:01:17.959> iced<00:01:18.350> on

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
spatula and this cake has been iced on

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
there we will cut it and then we have a

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.639 
there we will cut it and then we have a
pencil<00:02:05.840> sharpener

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.259 

that<00:02:09.649> we<00:02:09.890> use<00:02:10.190> we<00:02:10.459> found<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:10.849> good<00:02:11.030> pencil

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
that we use we found this good pencil

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:19.440 
that we use we found this good pencil
shortener<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:16.190> make<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:17.269> nice<00:02:17.510> point

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
shortener will make a really nice point

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.300 
shortener will make a really nice point
so<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.810> hit<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.080> first<00:02:21.410> piece<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.709> cardboard

so it's hit the first piece of cardboard
actually<00:02:22.730> there's<00:02:22.970> two<00:02:23.030> pieces<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.750> cardboard

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
actually there's two pieces of cardboard
