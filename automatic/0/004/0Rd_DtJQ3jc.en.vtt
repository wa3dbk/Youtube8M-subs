in some way shape or form which is
rather<00:02:21.210> exciting<00:02:21.750> because<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.050> will<00:02:22.140> mean

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
rather exciting because it will mean

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.320 
rather exciting because it will mean
that<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.620> card<00:02:22.980> will<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.370> other<00:02:23.640> targets

dragon in question for the cost which
really<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.850> not<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.240> nicest<00:03:00.420> thing<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.470> course

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
really is not the nicest thing of course

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.190 
really is not the nicest thing of course
unless<00:03:02.010> they<00:03:02.250> introduce<00:03:03.210> some<00:03:03.690> other<00:03:03.840> support

don't<00:03:08.520> like<00:03:08.550> why<00:03:08.790> sure<00:03:08.940> maybe<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.240> parallel

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
don't like why sure maybe a parallel

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.630 
don't like why sure maybe a parallel

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
world fusion but for cyber dragons maybe

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.740 
world fusion but for cyber dragons maybe
who<00:03:11.820> knows<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.380> quite<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:15.540> really

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.560 
wanna be banishing a cyber dragon
especially<00:03:17.610> considering<00:03:18.030> they<00:03:18.210> can<00:03:18.450> only

banish them if you control them author

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.200 
banish them if you control them author
in<00:03:20.220> their<00:03:20.340> hand<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.150> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
most likely be using it you can either

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.600 
most likely be using it you can either

use it to go finish your opponent off

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.070 
use it to go finish your opponent off
but<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> most<00:03:32.850> likely<00:03:33.240> in<00:03:33.480> case<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.870> will<00:03:33.990> be

but I most likely in case you will be

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.450 
but I most likely in case you will be

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460

and<00:04:27.949> synchros<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.580> course<00:04:28.789> have<00:04:29.240> much<00:04:29.599> better

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
and synchros of course have much better

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.320 
and synchros of course have much better
support<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:30.979> of<00:04:31.160> course<00:04:31.400> much<00:04:31.639> better<00:04:31.970> in

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
support and of course much better in

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.320 
support and of course much better in
terms<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:33.169> effort<00:04:33.889> for<00:04:33.919> your<00:04:34.520> awards<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.180> you

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
terms of effort for your awards that you

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.420 
terms of effort for your awards that you
get<00:04:35.539> out<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.750> there<00:04:36.020> like<00:04:36.259> a<00:04:36.289> fusion<00:04:36.830> which<00:04:37.220> are

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
get out of there like a fusion which are

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.029 
get out of there like a fusion which are
dated<00:04:38.180> however<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.139> cyber<00:04:39.349> dragon<00:04:39.710> fusion<00:04:39.979> is

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
dated however the cyber dragon fusion is

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.939 
dated however the cyber dragon fusion is
probably<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.430> most<00:04:40.460> powerful<00:04:41.740> arguably<00:04:42.740> all

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
probably the most powerful arguably all

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.219 
probably the most powerful arguably all
fusions<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:43.940> being<00:04:44.419> up<00:04:44.509> to<00:04:44.630> some<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.960> them<00:04:45.050> so

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
fusions so being up to some of them so

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.520 
fusions so being up to some of them so
easily<00:04:45.530> as<00:04:45.949> well<00:04:46.160> fire<00:04:46.580> its<00:04:46.819> effect<00:04:47.120> is

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
easily as well fire its effect is

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.710 
easily as well fire its effect is
fantastic<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.620> it's<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.800> very<00:04:48.830> nice<00:04:49.250> trick<00:04:49.729> and

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
fantastic and it's a very nice trick and

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.839 
fantastic and it's a very nice trick and
probably<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.169> best<00:04:51.530> trick<00:04:51.919> that<00:04:52.130> this<00:04:52.310> card

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
probably the best trick that this card

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.879 
probably the best trick that this card
has<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:53.539> course<00:04:54.199> she<00:04:54.289> allows<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.740> to

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
has of course she allows you to

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.740 
has of course she allows you to
basically<00:04:55.039> show<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.669> field<00:04:55.880> with<00:04:56.389> various

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
basically show on the field with various

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.450 
basically show on the field with various
cyber<00:04:56.960> dragons<00:04:57.409> and<00:04:57.590> including<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.370> original

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
cyber dragons and including the original

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.920 
cyber dragons and including the original
one<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:58.880> of<00:04:59.150> course<00:04:59.389> it's<00:04:59.569> in<00:04:59.720> other

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
one and of course it's in other

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.839 
one and of course it's in other
incarnations<00:05:00.319> yes<00:05:01.250> sure<00:05:01.430> its<00:05:01.639> attack

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
incarnations yes sure its attack

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.520 
incarnations yes sure its attack
increasing<00:05:02.240> effect<00:05:02.509> is<00:05:02.659> nice<00:05:03.139> but<00:05:03.409> actually

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
increasing effect is nice but actually

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.379 
increasing effect is nice but actually
it's<00:05:03.800> probably<00:05:03.889> irrelevant<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:05.030> want<00:05:05.270> this

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
it's probably irrelevant you want this

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.879 
it's probably irrelevant you want this
card<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.690> pretty<00:05:05.930> much<00:05:06.020> can<00:05:06.199> be<00:05:06.229> destroyed<00:05:06.590> but

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
card to pretty much can be destroyed but

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.290 
card to pretty much can be destroyed but
what<00:05:07.039> your<00:05:07.190> part<00:05:07.430> is<00:05:07.520> going<00:05:07.610> to<00:05:07.669> end<00:05:07.909> up<00:05:07.970> doing

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
what your part is going to end up doing

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.439 
what your part is going to end up doing
is<00:05:08.360> trying<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:09.470> hard<00:05:09.500> not<00:05:10.099> to<00:05:10.490> get<00:05:10.940> rid<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.240> it

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
is trying so hard not to get rid of it

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.909 
is trying so hard not to get rid of it
because<00:05:11.780> all<00:05:11.990> we<00:05:12.080> need<00:05:12.229> to<00:05:12.259> do<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.500> hit<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
because all we need to do is hit the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.649 
because all we need to do is hit the
graveyard<00:05:13.460> for<00:05:13.550> its<00:05:13.699> effect<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.030> go<00:05:14.180> off<00:05:14.419> and

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
graveyard for its effect to go off and

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.149 
graveyard for its effect to go off and
then<00:05:14.870> at<00:05:14.990> which<00:05:15.139> point<00:05:15.319> you<00:05:15.470> can<00:05:15.620> summon<00:05:15.800> cyber

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
then at which point you can summon cyber

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.070 
then at which point you can summon cyber
twin<00:05:16.400> dragon<00:05:16.520> or<00:05:17.000> cyber<00:05:17.240> end<00:05:17.509> dragon<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.020> you
