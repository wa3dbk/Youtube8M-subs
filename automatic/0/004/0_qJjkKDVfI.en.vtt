00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
trick you're going to take each packet

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.289 
trick you're going to take each packet
and<00:03:52.349> count<00:03:52.560> them<00:03:52.829> first<00:03:53.640> one<00:03:53.879> you're<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.209> to

count<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.720> five<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.290> keep<00:03:55.620> them<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.890> their

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
count to five but you keep them in their

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.800 
count to five but you keep them in their
original<00:03:56.250> order<00:03:56.879> one<00:03:57.150> two<00:03:57.660> three<00:03:58.560> four<00:03:59.040> five

original order one two three four five
now<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.290> will<00:04:01.410> turn<00:04:01.650> take<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.040> other<00:04:02.220> packet

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
now you will turn take the other packet

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.819 
now you will turn take the other packet
again<00:04:02.910> count<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.660> five<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.560> case

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
again count to five but in this case

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.620 
again count to five but in this case
you're<00:04:05.160> going<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.579> count<00:04:05.819> them<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.299> put<00:04:06.510> them

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
you're going to count them and put them

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.319 
you're going to count them and put them
in<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> reverse<00:04:07.049> order<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.340> how<00:04:08.519> you

matches the variation of this I think it

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.600 
matches the variation of this I think it
adds<00:06:06.060> several<00:06:06.680> points<00:06:07.680> that<00:06:08.070> make<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.520> a

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
adds several points that make it a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.930 
adds several points that make it a
stronger<00:06:08.880> effect<00:06:09.380> but<00:06:10.380> again<00:06:10.830> is<00:06:11.190> nearly

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
stronger effect but again is nearly
