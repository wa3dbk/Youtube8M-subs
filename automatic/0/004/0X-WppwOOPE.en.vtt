00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.960
 at 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.100
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.610
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.110
 go nickel 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.600
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.970
 new video on gta 5 online some 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 little information about gta 5 nextgen 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.690
 which were given to me by subscribers who 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.580
 had managed to have the game the little ones 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.720
 lucky 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.210
 so it is first party look 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 here a little originality on ps4 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.330
 keep when you have a character in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 story mode so there for example 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.690
 franklin down the joystick lights up at 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.010
 colors of this uncle character to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.019
 franck there you can see that the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.760
 joystick lights up in glass here michael 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.440
 watch the joystick light up in blue 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
 so very strong in my opinion it will be a 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 orange but I could not put you the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 picture unfortunately people 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 did not have to not advance enough 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 to have trevor in the game is here 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 watch a short video or when you 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.159
 are followed by the cops look at the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.519
 joystick flashes blue and orange blue 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.040
 and red 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.299
 which is really stylish so already for 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.400
 this little information I wanted 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.200
 thank you cÃ©dric of the 45 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.299
 and if a boot hd so really thanks to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.650
 you for these little info so then 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 we're going to talk about neon lights so neon lights 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.420
 you can move everywhere on 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.390
 the vehicle at the front it costs $ 1000 to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.900
 the back costs $ 1000 on the sides 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.330
 $ 1250 front and back $ 1800 to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.760
 the front and sides 2000 $ to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.560
 the back and sides $ 2,000 and 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.020
 everywhere so at the front in the back and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.760
 on the sides $ 3000 so that's okay 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.860
 to say that the prices are reasonable but 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.300
 it's prices that are in the cd price 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.710
 of story mode so wait for you 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 lend it a little more expensive 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.890
 in online mode then here for the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.930
 neon colors 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 we have 14 colors so here I think that 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 I see a dozen we have the white 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.260
 the blue the electric blue the worm 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.350
 nantes green lime yellow fever 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.520
 red orange yellow and candy pink which 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.320
 there are others that I can not 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.630
 not see on the picture so I did not get 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.580
 more information than that then 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.840
 it's a blues information up that 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.190
 sent me a little screen on twitter 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.870
 so I showed the links in the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.700
 description and who told me new 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.350
 fireplace in the apartment 400 miles 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 so if you want to go see go 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
 see in the description do you like the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 little twitter post link for you 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.530
 see the picture 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.330
 then I could talk to people 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.760
 who had the game so here I 'm going to do 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.069
 a small dedication welcomed 6 and if 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.170
 our boot is frankly mounted there 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.160
 was really amazed at so much that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.790
 it was realistic the view at first 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.010
 nobody 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.000
 they played a lot of time at the game in 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.950
 do this view in the first person 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.180
 so much that it's done well then 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.890
 may we say but it hurts a bit 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.480
 skull and with eyes to for example when 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.010
 he was doing the roulades know when you 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.720
 when you aim at exa then I believe that 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.180
 on the square key you make a 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.290
 small roll on the side is present 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.069
 even there when so when you do the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.700
 roulade with the view to the first 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.980
 nobody 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.090
 it's really a weird thing 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.470
 so fluid such as that 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.700
 first person when you play 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.750
 really long ago they told me that it 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.430
 was a little sore eyes 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.530
 so I'll see that when I can 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.930
 test then I was also told that at 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.220
 around alex custom in the street on 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.230
 could find vehicles that 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.519
 were already custom so that 's going to be 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.500
 not bad for dying glitches 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.630
 street vehicles or the same rockstar 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.860
 we note ourselves a little pole in 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.060
 does it allow us to enter 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.630
 vehicles in our garage that are 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.150
 already equipped 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.290
 which is really beautiful then 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.209
 at least as well said that with the view to the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.220
 first person you will have two modes 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.400
 finally view mode of sight we will say 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.160
 one where you will have your weapon that divides 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.660
 slightly want and spolidoro to say is 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.410
 one where you can really old 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.609
 in the ridiculous 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.730
 so it will also be up to you to 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.350
 then choose here I have another 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.660
 which was new to me 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.220
 given by the room it's rockstar in 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.200
 fact that answers a question about their 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.750
 Support someone asked if the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.890
 activities that have already been created if 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.600
 they will be transferred to 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.890
 new platforms and there we him 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.540
 answer yes all activities 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.549
 online advertising 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.780
 since the publisher are transferred to 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.310
 that you can continue to 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.200
 enjoy on new platforms 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.989
 however the photo stats rankings 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.220
 matic favorites list are specific to 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.989
 generating the platform on 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.209
 which you created them and do not 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.310
 will not be transferable from a small 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.750
 positive point all the activities we 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.880
 could introduce you to the activities 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.920
 what the fuck will be on next gen 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.239
 however, rankings and lists 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.819
 favorites and everything that all that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.230
 therefore follows in fact for example if 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.510
 you want to redo the activities what 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.220
 the fuck we offered you will have to 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.169
 go back on the video go back in the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.260
 description and actually put them back on 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.489
 the on the platform dagg jane and that's it 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510
 we come to the end of this video in 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.020

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.610
