00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.899
 now less than youtube 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.730
 in this video I will not show you a 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:11.740
 luxury I found that is called pirate storm 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.840
 good as the name says the game is 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.840
 it's about pirates or you have a boat 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.910
 there, I forgot to do different 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.910
 scales so it's another game more 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 it's like a mini breakthrough with I'm 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 doing good 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.190
 I am registered water enters by the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 beige book more quickly make me all 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.469
 bill 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.469
 with the login 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.040
 but they do not say half slow because 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.040
 I'm on the netbook 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.490
 or directly this facebook 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.890
 I do not want to be a bus in itself 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.320
 the thing is very good more than 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.140
 you like pirate games 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.120
 or games but pirates and do not have to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.850
 like the pirates to be able to play the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.250
 game I do not like pirates and me 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.250
 it's costing the game a lot, so 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 it was a scheme that I already passed the tutorial and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.970
 us to be able to show or be in your 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.420
 back showed quite a few things like 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.330
 learn to play as the basic things 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.180
 or how to attack the easiest 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.440
 surprised if not this with the buttons 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440
 and the serious allies 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.050
 she is very useful doctor 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.860
 and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.860
 in charge 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.979
 What I like most in the game is that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.430
 you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.180
 wow 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.319
 you have your own home your own 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.939
 boat action in progress 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:27.219
 then well this is pirate this 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:31.000
 you have your own ship you can destroy 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:33.790
 other enemy ships or as if they were 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.739
 threats lived other enemies as a 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.359
 supposedly giant crab and you can 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.430
 find treasures like this one that's 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.140
 here that if I do not hurry, they're going to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.480
 steal well 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.330
 you can make money to great treasures or 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.400
 distributing other types of boats as 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.460
 people who say sea rat give you click 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.860
 a rat of the sea 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.840
 the label 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.940
 Well first I'm going to cure it because 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.020
 I was fighting a bug 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.880
 I take my day 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.770
 ready 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.090
 so we're going to mess up more rat of the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.090
 market and still please 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.100
 they were here they are sometimes to attack and 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 objective very basil sefac eat 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:25.030
 through if it comes well dry in my 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.030
 boat is throwing them like balls 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.580
 and be the ones who will escape and is 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.629
 leaving things and we good said that 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.129
 I like it is that these boats like marcus 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:42.790
 and it happens to us when I go sad to you 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.390
 enemy leaves booties or as the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.599
 cracks booties chests with things and all 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.970
 the wave then as under you kill some 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.879
 and they always leave a chest or 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.230
 find thrown and are 78 desperate 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.970
 that go behind you to try to 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.130
 grab the comfer you too what later 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.450
 in the game that I love and good 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.130

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.829
