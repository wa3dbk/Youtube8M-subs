00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:19.840
 we need newsprint glue 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.840
 for wood hot water borax 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:31.310
 pigments of brown color and a good for 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.250
 mix the ingredients of newsprint 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.320
 quite small 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:43.400
 the small paper makes it easy to 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:46.070
 to make the dough the second step is 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.770
 put boiling water on this paper 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:55.070
 put water to cover the entire paper 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.110
 chopped up give a stir to anyone who trains 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.719
 well in that role and whoever gets 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:05.239
 very wet in the third step let's go 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.340
 place the shredded paper inside the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.420
 blender and let's beat until it turns 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.420
 a thick paste 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.130
 remove the dough in the blender and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.810
 Let's put it on a colander like that. 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.830
 let's remove any excess water 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 squeeze well with the help of a spoon 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:42.150
 this mass should be almost dry with 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.520
 cold mass we will mix the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.060
 ingredients to make the dough for 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.010
 wood so there is no waste pick up 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.160
 amount of mass you think 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.370
 that will use in your project 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.190
 Let's squeeze the dough until it 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.630
 Her water has to stay quite a lot. 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.310
 Dry the less water it has better 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.790
 because it will be much faster in the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.710
 wood put a generous amount 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:16.230
 and mix thoroughly 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.020
 we will obey this mass again 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.020
 but now we will obey with the glue 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.070
 when you see that the dough is already 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.140
 incorporated with the glue 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.170
 Let's add the pigment mix 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.380
 mix well until all the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.380
 pigment and the glue incorporated in this 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.560
 How can you fight here with these pines? 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.400
 small in the mass this is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.740
 cellulose is what is going to help 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.380
 this dough the way you want it 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.510
 That's the point, and the glue is clear now that the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.770
 mass is ready, we can put the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.910
 box is the ball he will act as 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.250
 preservative as well as preventing 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.770
 fungi growth on wood and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.770
 also help repeated insects and termites 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:30.300
 mix well so that the time that they enter 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:33.420
 throughout the mass the mass was ready to 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.100
 consistency is very good and let's do 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.610
 now our first fill in the 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.610
 wood 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.870
 this rustic wooden bowl she 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.240
 shows cracks 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:55.560
 these drawers with the grease 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.390
 that we just do with the help of some 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.030
 sharp object 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.330
 we will overcome both the mass within 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.330
 crack 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.060
 after we cover all the crack with 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.549
 this mass 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.000
 let's make finger type a spatula 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:28.040
 soft we tighten that among all 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.500
 inside the crack and then it's just 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.550
 withdraw with your finger the excess of 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.550
 mass that was left out 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.100
 ready to crack is completely 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.990
 capped with the dough if after drying 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.170
 Do you still notice any difference in 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.590
 between the mass and color of the wood is 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.800
 just pass a mordent paint to match 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.540
 the color if you know otherwise 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.460
 interesting to plug holes 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.140
 small and screams in the wood 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.550
 share with us leaving your 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.550
