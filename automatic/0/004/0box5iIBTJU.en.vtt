00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.049
 I am mario persona and these are the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.770
 answers that God asked me 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.770
 About the Bible 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 the question was the land was created before 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.260
 of the stars 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.260
 I answered the following you said that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.289
 according to science does not make sense God 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.760
 have created the stars and the sun only after 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 of having created the earth 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 I also think it does not make sense 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.780
 mainly because the Bible does not say 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 in genesis what many people 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.289
 they think it says 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.839
 Notice that the biblical text in Genesis 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.839
 chapter does not say god has created the 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.749
 sun and the moon and stars on the fourth day 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.819
 although it may seem so if you 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:51.059
 you will see that you are not 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:54.389
 saying that on that day God created 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.420
 the stars themselves but the function of 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.019
 umbuzeiros lamps he made in this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.179
 day 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.389
 don nelson's version of the usa 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.060
 simply lights where the longed-for version 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:09.479
 corrected says luminaries and longing 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 updated says light kisses genesis 1 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.049
 14 19 and said god aja lamps in the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 expansion of the heavens for separation 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.750
 between day and night and let them be 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.020
 signals and for certain times and stop 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.539
 days and years are for paulo me noses 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.619
 the expanse of the heavens to light up and 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.799
 so it was 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.829
 and God made the two great lights 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.590
 large lamps or lights illuminate the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.619
 alos to govern the day and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.170
 illuminate the smaller alos to rule the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.929
 night and made the stars and god put us 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.329
 in the expanse of the heavens to illuminate 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.759
 earth and to rule day and night 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.909
 to make the separation between light and 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.159
 darkness and saw god that it was good and 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.710
 afternoon and tomorrow the 4th 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.069
 I can make a lamp in one day. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.350
 but only will create light when lit 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.469
 although the stars are called 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.349
 verse 16 so the first time 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.000
 the sun is called by its name in genesis 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.090
 15 verse 12 and the moon on 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.580
 Genesis 37 verse 9 I understand that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.280
 these stars already existed but had no 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.920
 the function God gives them in the room 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.440
 day of what we usually call 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.160
 creation but that it actually 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.560
 Land restoration of chaos in which she 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.940
 I was then to be able to be 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.280
 inhabited by man 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.440
 therefore on the fourth day what god was 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.440
 was to establish the stars as 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.250
 governance of day and night and 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.680
 seasons 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.430
 since before that in Genesis one 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.230
 verse 5 he had already made separation 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.820
 between light and darkness 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.590
 if you understand that there is a gap 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.730
 between verse 12 genesis chapter one 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.459
 you will know that the stars in general 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.980
 must have been created at the outset 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.870
 when God created the heavens and the earth 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.390
 genesis 1 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.209
 this primordial land may have suffered 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.420
 a cataclysm that left devastated by 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:17.290
 this is said to ground them into shape in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.220
 Hebrew toho and empty in grain in Hebrew 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.799
 it is good and sees darkness on the face of 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.900
 abyss that the genesis a verse 2 a 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.440
 I do not know if this is the way it is. 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.010
 pronounced as formless in the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.910
 version means bleak and in the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.760
 original and dumb is empty as if it were 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.860
 a vacuum that was not the state 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.190
 original earth created by god us 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.350
 we know what the prophet Isaiah reveals 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.810
 isaiah says why so says the Lord 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.650
 has created the heavens oh god that formed the 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:58.390
 earth and did it is confirmed did not create it 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 the original empty donkey or isolated but the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:06.030
 formed to be inhabited is in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.030
 isaiah chapter 45 verse 18
