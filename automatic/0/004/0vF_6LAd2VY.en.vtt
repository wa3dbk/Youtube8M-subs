00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
further away it zooms in and out as you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
further away it zooms in and out as you
can<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> nice<00:01:57.329> feature<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.780> have

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
can see which is a nice feature to have

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.429 
can see which is a nice feature to have
so<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.860> wanted<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> just<00:02:00.270> basically<00:02:00.570> move

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
so if you wanted to just basically move

so if you wanted to just basically move
it<00:02:01.560> closer<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> need<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> bigger

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it closer and you need to get it bigger

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.120 
it closer and you need to get it bigger
I<00:02:03.450> mean<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.810> bigger<00:02:04.140> or<00:02:04.290> smaller<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.979> can

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.580 
I mean are bigger or smaller as you can
see<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.909> anyways<00:02:06.420> another<00:02:07.140> nice<00:02:07.560> feature

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
see but anyways another nice feature

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
see but anyways another nice feature
that<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.789> stock<00:02:09.000> browser<00:02:09.030> has<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.660> when<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that the stock browser has is when you

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.260 
that the stock browser has is when you
pinch<00:02:10.140> zoom<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> pinch<00:02:10.950> do

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
pinch zoom if you pinch do

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.200 
pinch zoom if you pinch do
I<00:02:11.330> believe<00:02:11.810> if<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.050> pinch<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.550> enough<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:13.850> you

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
I believe if you pinch it enough as you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.420 
I believe if you pinch it enough as you
can<00:02:14.300> see<00:02:14.510> opens<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:15.050> new<00:02:15.080> windows<00:02:15.590> thing<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.340> you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
can see opens a new windows thing so you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.820 
can see opens a new windows thing so you
can<00:02:16.460> hit<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.730> new<00:02:16.940> new<00:02:17.750> window<00:02:18.080> option<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.770> you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
can hit a new new window option so you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.400 
can hit a new new window option so you
can<00:02:18.950> open<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> new<00:02:19.370> window<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:19.880> need<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.410> so

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
can open a new window if you need to so

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770 
can open a new window if you need to so
that's<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.400> if<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.610> pinch<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.120> zoom<00:02:23.150> far

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
that's just if you pinch to zoom far

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.960 
that's just if you pinch to zoom far
enough<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:24.860> open<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.220> windows<00:02:25.820> up

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
enough in it will open that windows up

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.040 
enough in it will open that windows up
and<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.330> can<00:02:26.450> scroll<00:02:26.780> through<00:02:26.840> your

and so you can scroll through your
different<00:02:27.410> windows<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:28.640> a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
different windows so that's just a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.330 
different windows so that's just a
feature<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.150> believe<00:02:29.480> only<00:02:29.780> on<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.680> galaxy<00:02:31.190> s2

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
feature I believe only on the galaxy s2

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.430 
feature I believe only on the galaxy s2
so<00:02:31.880> stabs<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.900> there<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.230> also<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:35.440> another
