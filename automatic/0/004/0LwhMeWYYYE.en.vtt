00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
to scoop out a hole for the olive but it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.960 
to scoop out a hole for the olive but it
didn't<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.080> one<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.620> just<00:02:22.890> used<00:02:23.190> these

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
didn't have one so I just used these

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.000 
didn't have one so I just used these
measuring<00:02:24.390> spoons<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.930> had<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.230> hand<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
just carefully hollow out a little

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.550 
just carefully hollow out a little
indentation<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.280> olive<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.390> fit<00:02:33.560> so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
here I'm placing my homemade eyeballs

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.360 
here I'm placing my homemade eyeballs
and<00:02:36.390> thigh<00:02:36.540> bulb<00:02:36.870> tray<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.500> experimenting

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and thigh bulb tray I'm experimenting

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.760 
and thigh bulb tray I'm experimenting
and<00:02:38.700> putting<00:02:39.000> some<00:02:39.209> facing<00:02:39.690> down<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.560> found

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
and putting some facing down and I found

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.080 
and putting some facing down and I found
those<00:02:40.950> ones<00:02:41.160> actually<00:02:41.340> showed<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.880> better

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
those ones actually showed up better

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
those ones actually showed up better
than<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.510> ones<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.780> were<00:02:42.959> facing<00:02:43.170> up<00:02:45.530> lastly

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
than the ones that were facing up lastly

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.130 
than the ones that were facing up lastly
I<00:02:46.560> included<00:02:47.010> my<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.459> radish<00:02:47.730> eyeball<00:02:48.180> then

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
I included my little radish eyeball then

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.320 
I included my little radish eyeball then
fill<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> tray<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:49.860> some<00:02:49.890> cold<00:02:50.310> water<00:02:50.520> but

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
fill the tray with some cold water but

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.970 
fill the tray with some cold water but
you<00:02:51.450> could<00:02:51.570> also<00:02:51.690> use<00:02:51.959> soda<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.590> something

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
you could also use soda like something

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
you could also use soda like something
up<00:02:53.100> or<00:02:53.250> something<00:02:53.520> like<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:54.209> as<00:02:54.750> long

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
up or something like that just as long

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.560 
up or something like that just as long
as<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.170> clear<00:02:55.940> then<00:02:56.940> pop<00:02:57.180> them<00:02:57.330> into<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
as it's clear then pop them into the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.240 
as it's clear then pop them into the
freezer<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.959> make<00:02:58.230> sure<00:02:58.410> they're<00:02:58.560> level<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.130> a

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
freezer and make sure they're level in a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.720 
freezer and make sure they're level in a
few<00:02:59.430> hours

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
few hours

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.210 
few hours
you<00:03:00.060> should<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.360> frozen<00:03:00.600> eyeballs<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.100> am

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
you should have frozen eyeballs so I am

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.830 
you should have frozen eyeballs so I am
back<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.850> ice<00:03:03.000> cube<00:03:03.300> trays<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.540> are

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
back with the ice cube trays that are

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.530 
back with the ice cube trays that are
now<00:03:03.989> completely<00:03:04.650> frozen<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.269> kind<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
now completely frozen this was kind of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.930 
now completely frozen this was kind of
one<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:06.840> minor<00:03:07.049> concerns<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.160> ice

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
one of my minor concerns is that the ice

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.410 
one of my minor concerns is that the ice
wouldn't<00:03:09.420> freeze<00:03:09.720> completely<00:03:10.049> clear<00:03:10.739> or

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
wouldn't freeze completely clear or

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.110 
wouldn't freeze completely clear or
bubble<00:03:12.420> free<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:14.040> froze<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.580> top<00:03:14.760> half<00:03:15.000> of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
bubble free so I froze the top half of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.479 
bubble free so I froze the top half of
these<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.500> see<00:03:16.739> with<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.130> eyeballs

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
these as you can see with the eyeballs

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.640 
these as you can see with the eyeballs
facing<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.390> they're<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:18.989> hard<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.320> see

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
facing up and they're really hard to see

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.630 
facing up and they're really hard to see
I<00:03:20.209> turned<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.540> couple<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:22.110> over<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:23.190> see<00:03:23.400> if

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
I turned a couple of them over to see if

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.479 
I turned a couple of them over to see if
they<00:03:23.970> would<00:03:24.120> come<00:03:24.299> out<00:03:24.450> more<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:26.220> they<00:03:26.340> would

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
they would come out more so they would

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.890 
they would come out more so they would
be<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.120> clearer<00:03:27.390> I'm<00:03:27.510> not<00:03:27.690> sure

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
be a little bit clearer I'm not sure

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.560 
be a little bit clearer I'm not sure
there<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.220> eyeball<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.239> radish

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
there is the eyeball that the radish

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.630 
there is the eyeball that the radish
eyeball<00:03:30.959> which<00:03:31.200> looks<00:03:31.410> pretty<00:03:31.470> good

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
eyeball which looks pretty good

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.509 
eyeball which looks pretty good
and<00:03:33.290> these<00:03:34.290> are<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> two<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> made<00:03:35.430> that

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
and these are the two that I made that

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.160 
and these are the two that I made that
are<00:03:35.640> homemade<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.420> I'm<00:03:36.510> not<00:03:36.630> sure<00:03:36.690> how<00:03:36.870> those

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
are homemade so I'm not sure how those

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.930 
are homemade so I'm not sure how those
will<00:03:37.350> turn<00:03:37.500> out<00:03:37.620> either<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.160> let's<00:03:38.670> check<00:03:38.850> them

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
will turn out either so let's check them

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.420 
will turn out either so let's check them
out<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.630> gonna<00:03:39.810> give<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.350> twist<00:03:40.769> so

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
out I'm gonna give it a little twist so

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.509 
out I'm gonna give it a little twist so
yeah<00:03:42.390> these<00:03:42.570> are<00:03:42.720> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.959> disappointing<00:03:43.650> so

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
yeah these are kind of disappointing so

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.690 
yeah these are kind of disappointing so
here's<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.180> eyeball<00:03:45.900> with<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.799> iris

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
here's the eyeball with the iris

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.030 
here's the eyeball with the iris
pointing<00:03:48.150> up<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.470> back<00:03:49.650> which<00:03:49.920> is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
pointing up this is the back which is

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.789 
pointing up this is the back which is
white<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.640> turned<00:03:51.630> some<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.930> them<00:03:52.019> over<00:03:52.290> and

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
white I turned some of them over and

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.970 
white I turned some of them over and
there's<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.310> eyeball<00:03:53.700> bear<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:55.830> see

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
there's the eyeball bear and you can see

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.310 
there's the eyeball bear and you can see
a<00:03:56.010> little<00:03:56.190> bit<00:03:56.370> from<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.640> side<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.169> the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
a little bit from the side this is the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.430 
a little bit from the side this is the
homemade<00:03:58.739> one<00:03:59.900> which<00:04:00.900> looks<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.200> little<00:04:01.260> bit

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
homemade one which looks a little bit

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.990 
homemade one which looks a little bit
more<00:04:01.709> ghoulish

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
more ghoulish

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.720 
more ghoulish
more<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:03.840> an<00:04:03.990> eyeball<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.370> homemade

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
more like an eyeball and the homemade

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.670 
more like an eyeball and the homemade
ones<00:04:05.970> didn't<00:04:06.330> turn<00:04:06.480> out<00:04:06.540> very<00:04:06.600> well<00:04:06.990> at<00:04:07.140> all

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
ones didn't turn out very well at all

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.350 
ones didn't turn out very well at all
look<00:04:08.190> about<00:04:08.430> what<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.730> junior<00:04:09.030> mint<00:04:09.210> in<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
look about what the junior mint in the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.990 
look about what the junior mint in the
middle<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.980> wouldn't<00:04:11.370> recommend<00:04:11.610> doing

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
middle so I wouldn't recommend doing

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.090 
middle so I wouldn't recommend doing
that<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.600> not<00:04:12.750> really<00:04:12.960> worth<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.320> effort

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
that it's not really worth the effort

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.170 
that it's not really worth the effort
someone<00:04:14.820> add<00:04:14.970> some<00:04:15.240> water<00:04:15.450> oh<00:04:16.730> that<00:04:17.730> helps<00:04:17.910> I

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
someone add some water oh that helps I

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.380 
someone add some water oh that helps I
guess<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:20.459> then<00:04:20.519> when<00:04:20.670> you<00:04:20.730> add<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.150> water

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
guess and then when you add to the water

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.670 
guess and then when you add to the water
you<00:04:21.870> can<00:04:22.049> see<00:04:22.260> them<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> little<00:04:22.800> bit<00:04:23.190> better

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
you can see them a little bit better

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.170 
you can see them a little bit better
there<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.800> go<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.550> can<00:04:26.580> see<00:04:26.880> them<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.030> little

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
there you go you can see them a little

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.890 
there you go you can see them a little
bit<00:04:27.420> better<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:29.270> think<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.480> one<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.690> looks

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
bit better I think the one that looks

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.330 
bit better I think the one that looks
most<00:04:31.080> like<00:04:31.230> an<00:04:31.440> eyeball<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.950> actually<00:04:32.250> the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
most like an eyeball is actually the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.090 
most like an eyeball is actually the
radish<00:04:32.730> one<00:04:33.800> my<00:04:34.800> water<00:04:35.040> tastes<00:04:35.400> slightly<00:04:35.550> like

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
radish one my water tastes slightly like

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.350 
radish one my water tastes slightly like
very<00:04:38.100> cold<00:04:38.490> gummy<00:04:38.940> bear

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
very cold gummy bear

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.590 
very cold gummy bear
there's<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.080> eyeball<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:41.150> taste<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.330> here<00:04:42.510> we

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
there's the eyeball and taste it here we

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:51.520 
there's the eyeball and taste it here we
go<00:04:43.880> huh<00:04:46.010> no<00:04:47.010> cold

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.050 

Cairo's<00:04:54.560> flavors<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.740> bad<00:04:55.980> it's<00:04:56.760> just<00:04:56.820> like

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
Cairo's flavors not bad it's just like

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.930 
Cairo's flavors not bad it's just like
one<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.270> those<00:04:57.420> gummy<00:04:57.780> frogs<00:04:58.080> or<00:04:58.350> something

one of those gummy frogs or something

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.130 
one of those gummy frogs or something
but<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.030> texture<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.420> really<00:05:00.540> gross<00:05:00.870> it's

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
but the texture is really gross it's

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.400 
but the texture is really gross it's
really<00:05:01.380> mushy<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.730> then<00:05:03.150> kind<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:03.990> hard<00:05:04.230> in

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
really mushy and then kind of hard in

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.450 
really mushy and then kind of hard in
the<00:05:04.500> middle<00:05:06.500> floors<00:05:07.500> not<00:05:07.620> bad<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:08.160> taste<00:05:08.400> the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
the middle floors not bad just taste the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.280 
the middle floors not bad just taste the
co<00:05:08.580> regular<00:05:08.880> old<00:05:09.030> gummy<00:05:09.419> bear<00:05:09.600> or<00:05:09.810> gummy<00:05:10.080> frog

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
or something like that the frozen

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.300 
or something like that the frozen
process<00:05:13.050> makes<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.440> whole<00:05:13.590> outside<00:05:13.770> really

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
process makes the whole outside really

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.060 
process makes the whole outside really
mushy<00:05:14.960> but<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.140> middle<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:16.560> like<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.830> gummy

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
mushy but the middle is like a gummy

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.270 
mushy but the middle is like a gummy
bear

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
bear

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.930 
bear
so<00:05:18.120> yeah<00:05:18.630> that's<00:05:18.750> not<00:05:18.930> bad<00:05:19.520> I'm<00:05:20.520> not<00:05:20.580> sure<00:05:20.910> I

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
so yeah that's not bad I'm not sure I

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.460 
so yeah that's not bad I'm not sure I
would<00:05:21.180> recommend<00:05:21.600> doing<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.260> paying

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
would recommend doing this for paying

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.980 
would recommend doing this for paying
the<00:05:22.590> $5<00:05:23.100> for<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.370> cuz<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.450> eyeballs<00:05:24.780> aren't

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
the $5 for it cuz the eyeballs aren't

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.080 
the $5 for it cuz the eyeballs aren't
really<00:05:25.169> that<00:05:25.320> apparent<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.980> think<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.910> other

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
really that apparent I think the other

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.180 
really that apparent I think the other
the<00:05:27.570> Martha<00:05:27.870> Stewart<00:05:28.080> one<00:05:28.320> was<00:05:28.470> really<00:05:28.680> cool<00:05:28.890> I

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
the Martha Stewart one was really cool I

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.430 
the Martha Stewart one was really cool I
think<00:05:29.700> that<00:05:29.910> would<00:05:30.030> have<00:05:30.120> really<00:05:30.240> be<00:05:30.480> a<00:05:30.750> fun

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
think that would have really be a fun

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.010 
think that would have really be a fun
idea<00:05:31.770> for<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:32.160> martini<00:05:32.940> or<00:05:33.060> a<00:05:33.330> cocktail<00:05:33.570> party

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
idea for a martini or a cocktail party

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.600 
idea for a martini or a cocktail party
