with the game itself but also watching

with the game itself but also watching
the<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> gamers<00:01:21.330> attention<00:01:21.810> is

university<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.960> certainly<00:01:34.110> has

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
university I think it certainly has

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
university I think it certainly has
changed<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.220> certainly<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
changed it certainly has it at this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
changed it certainly has it at this
university<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
university you know that I think that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.720 
university you know that I think that
there<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> sense<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.210> game<00:01:39.509> development

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
there was a sense that game development

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.600 
there was a sense that game development
was<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> bit<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:42.140> fad<00:01:42.410> but<00:01:42.800> that's<00:01:43.130> changing

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
was a bit of a fad but that's changing

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.970 
was a bit of a fad but that's changing
people<00:01:43.940> see<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.470> leading

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
people see that this is is a leading

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.530 
people see that this is is a leading
edge<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.280> something<00:01:46.520> new<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:46.970> terms<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.360> media

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
edge of something new in terms of media

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.810 
edge of something new in terms of media
and<00:01:47.900> how<00:01:47.990> people<00:01:48.320> interact<00:01:48.550> get<00:01:49.550> information

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
and how people interact get information

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:08.190 
and how people interact get information
enjoy<00:01:50.600> entertainment

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.830 

the<00:02:08.890> industry<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.490> fairly<00:02:09.819> large<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.450> think

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
the industry is fairly large I think

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.870 
the industry is fairly large I think
we're<00:02:10.990> building<00:02:11.770> different<00:02:12.099> types<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.640> games

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
we're building different types of games

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.100 
we're building different types of games
we're<00:02:13.209> solving<00:02:13.390> different<00:02:13.810> types<00:02:13.959> of

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
we're solving different types of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.670 
we're solving different types of
problems

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
problems

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.740 
problems
I<00:02:14.709> think<00:02:15.520> that's<00:02:15.670> getting<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.030> attention<00:02:16.150> of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
I think that's getting the attention of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.240 
I think that's getting the attention of
the<00:02:16.870> educational<00:02:17.410> institutions<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.940 

certainly<00:02:33.200> seeing<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.530> lot<00:02:33.710> more<00:02:33.740> interest

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
certainly seeing a lot more interest

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.420 
certainly seeing a lot more interest
from<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.030> educational<00:02:35.540> sector<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.430> honestly
