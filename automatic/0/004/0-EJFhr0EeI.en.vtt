00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.940
 competition shipping by him for 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.879
 replenishment 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.329
 I think it is unlikely 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.889
 Well, firstly the problem of railways 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:16.980
 Russia 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.199
 There complex problem so themselves 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.980
 imagine the road is bad rolling stock 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.230
 old miss him 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.760
 plus the timing is not clear with the sea 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.519
 transport as the ship left 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.649
 similar thoughts goes goes and goes it 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:31.320
 will help 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.230
 well there by the storm there as a last resort 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.330
 a little there yes to day two but the tampa passed 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.690
 Here is the process of guarding the transport 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.740
 driven composition or there platform to a standstill 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.260
 she stands just not and that's it 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.749
 but it can be provided 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.149
 until they start looking to pull out of there and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.130
 etc 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.450
 in such cases not very often 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.880
 especially in Russia 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.219
 it was always like that 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.219
 hundreds of years that he is from china 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.840
 export goes through ports 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.370
 land routes they are not like this in China 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.160
 very restless neighbors 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.560
 and not always 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.910
 this safe happened said so 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.350
 for example cargo delivered 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.230
 by land from china for example 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.320
 Kazakhstan container is permissible 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.860
 if goes 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.640
 TOO container from Kazakhstan not 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.200
 returns from kazakhstan from 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.010
 Kyrgyzstan with Uzbekistan 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.310
 containers are not returned 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.550
 knowing this interest 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.440
 You are ordering freight here all in t 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.220
 immediately offered to buy contacts to the client 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 definitely a hundred years 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.520
 just the conditions you should buy 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.210
 container because we know that u MMK us 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.790
 will never return 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.580
 here's how black the shore and here for 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.430
 I think of them sheds what kind of hangars 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.970
 there helpers that is of these 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 containers 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.960
 does not return 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.900
 if it got there yet 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.140
 because n on the border with Kazakhstan 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.910
 and here these countries 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.600
 Dynamo crossings there just help 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.560
 there is essentially chaos there 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.500
 well this is criminal business absolutely 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.670
 based on some kind of personal connections 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.660
 phone calls arrangements 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.259
 war there are no more treaties 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.649
 paper this even if their 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.709
 hardly anyone of whom is there in general 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.599
 principle 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.769
 essentially since the days when 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.909
 the caravan was robbed there some sort of robbers and 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.829
 nomads when I changed little 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.010
 September Kursk Autonomous Region there 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.899
 his igoshin but essentially Uzbek Uzbeks 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.899
 so call your city and the threat of 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.059
 that disappears but as if not just there 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.099
 vodka 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.409
 leads to fts mobile for example laden 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.119
 wagons so here it is 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.500
 swing, but the transition to trucking 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.520
 it may not reach the autojunction may 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.240
 get there just nafta goes over ghetto or 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.670
 having passed it so strange disappear i 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.739
 I think it is easy 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.389
 it's all very content 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.309
 criminal smells 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.739
 make the project active 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.049
 discusses stream activation 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:02:59.580
 freight 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.830
 turned out should be now in central 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.500
 parts of kazakhstan country you are 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.080
 say that after a few 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.299
 of contracts 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.569
 such projects are unlikely to be strong 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.989
 state support so 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:11.579
 to tell 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.629
 on one side on the other side of china 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.529
 of course Anapa is torn but 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.909
 find some direct routes to europe 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.119
 but for the transit of their goods 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.659
 I think that here the prices on the situation of Ugra 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.499
 will develop so the Chinese at the end 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.329
 ends but go with your hand order 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.049
 Yes 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.069
 building infrastructure 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.370
 Rosalia is always rock already iron and 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.209
 automotive 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.659
 but that he will be further beyond the borders of the borders 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.229
 Kazakhstan with all the efforts 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.229
 local authorities there still still 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.699
 pretty 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.969
 wild economy I think 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.879
 these projects 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.219
 earn about one best case can 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.590
 be ten years later 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.279
 avantek met in october 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:02.789
 so agreed that they will 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.219
 together with 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.579
 updated rolling stock 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.939
 China supershow yourself we want we want 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.699
 at home agree in the end 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.169
 massively build on the street 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.479
 do rail platforms 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.569
 release 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.769
 because their Russia is not enough 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.949
 here but we need a transsib of course how 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.940
 the same run and run through 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.129
 it needs to be done about responsibility 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.990
 but if the Crimean Tatar 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.819
 bochin dilapidated state all this 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.520
 is very running 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.270
 when 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.289
 driving along Chinese roads 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.409
 iron for example here from Guangzhou 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.740
 shenzhen 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.129
 Hong Kong 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.610
 bottomless rails 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.180
 train speeds of over two hundred 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.199
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.409
 for example Chechen statist site 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.849
 where the composition is moving in the Pskov Nation 20 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:56.840
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.310
 tuck in just thats up to 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.240
 ugliness just dumping all lj shelves 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.539
 dramatically of course 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.610
 brother sozaev here then this here this 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.800
 it would be for Russia of course 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.159
 very warm 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.550
 because the Chinese are quietly 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.249
 parallel to the transsib you 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:16.569
 arranges 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.300
 piece by piece offspring 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.419
 connects in parallel 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.259
 embed in your own hands 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.419
 we will never finish the transsib with us just 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.419
 will die and with the transsib will die the whole 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.539
 our far east 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.639
 and from this point of view now evolve 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.629
 help the Chinese develop 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.170
 shortest paths 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.870
 from china to europe 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.129
 through Kazakhstan and so on to us 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.939
 strategic considers 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.809
 nor profitable unnecessary it 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:45.589
 short sighted
