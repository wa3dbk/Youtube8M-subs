00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello guys and girls that welcome you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.370
 a new video today in this video is 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 address a very important issue in the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 workouts that is to eat after 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.620
 to train then so for a cousin 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.620
 with relation we started 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.550
 mainly glycogen levels 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.830
 that we have in the muscles and 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.619
 possibly consume fats and in 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.200
 last case the muscles continue 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.590
 training it is essential to recover those 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.000
 glycogen levels that are at a minimum 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.340
 to recover glycogen levels 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.160
 that everyone to the minimum we will take a 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.510
 amount of carbohydrates 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.970
 and another amount of this unit of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.530
 proteins to take those carbohydrates 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.910
 what do we need? 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.430
 we can take for example with wheat 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.050
 accelerate a banana that is a fruit that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.840
 It gives a lot of energy that has a great 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.879
 amount of carbohydrates to start them 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.559
 technical high because we do not have phenomenal 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.360
 for that moment one with all the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.300
 proteins we liked most to our smoothie 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.250
 of routine whey protein that I eat 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.710
 you know is the protein that is extracted 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 directly from milk is the protein 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.789
 of maximum quality a supplement that 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.590
 would contain frankly well for that 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.380
 muscular regulation would be to take the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.090
 Glutamine is an event that we 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.440
 would recover that gene group perfectly 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.780
 a lost 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.150
 assuming I would recommend that you take it 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.730
 6 always at the end of each training 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.980
 Many people wonder when there is 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.650
 take all this at what time and take it 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.390
 So the first thing we should take are the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.080
 carbohydrates before the protein that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.580
 Many people are not easy but it is first 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.430
 two cavity is always by the curtain 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.310
 so with you have to train take the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.650
 banana and about ten minutes later then 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.410
 We take two and after ten minutes 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.180
 all born protein point with the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.640
 glutamine if you want to take those 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.320
 Senior vitamins good guys 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.170
 dismissal I hope you liked this 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.840
 video of what to eat after training 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.190
 subscribe take out to like 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.110
 share it the video among our 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.770
 friends and see you in the next video 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 a greeting
