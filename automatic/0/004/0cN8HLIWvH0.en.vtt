00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.439
 the grand canyon that cemetery of 128 passengers and the crew of two 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.089
 commercial aircraft that collided in a thunderstorm and crashed 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.849
 in the peaks are separated by a distance of two kilometers the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.820
 violator reduced the remains to charred marches of paint and metal nobody 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.820
 survived was the worst commercial air disaster in history 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.060
 while the military used some black boxes and voice recorders 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.100
 of experimental pilots during the Second World War 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.929
 it was not until there was a 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.229
 collision in mid air in 1956 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.819
 that the federal aviation administration forced to use boxes to 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.550
 Record 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.760
 the accident so serious and without giving the Grand Canyon 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.490
 that the federal aviation administration and the national board of 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.190
 transportation security required all airlines that were 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 equipped with an audio recording system 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 from the obligation of voice recordings in the booth 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.990
 there have been hundreds of reports of strange lights almost collisions and the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 radar tracking of unidentified flying objects 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.540
 there were three recent recordings of pilots captured about nine 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.850
 england for this transmission are presented here for the first time one of 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.370
 the most fascinating cases is in what they are 4 0 5 that came out of the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.010
 jfk airport on November 18, 1995 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.560
 where they saw 1 million to her 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.280
 November 18, 1995 while the Lufthansa flight was over 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.100
 the one and the anp 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 new York 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.380
 well a disturbing call the aerial control traffic tower in boston 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.439
 the pilot reported an unidentified flying object that passed about 900 meters 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.439
 of your aircraft 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.890
 besides wellness in our with the 1 160 kilometers 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.530
 it happened to be minute it was really very strange is described in 2000 as a 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.060
 long object and without indicated with a white light on the front and a tail in shape 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.430
 of long and green kite 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.750
 the strange min 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.500
 is also enlisted by British Flight 226 flight 7 7 7 that came 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.280
 of london and it was just north of the object the code name for the flight 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.700
 from british opposite is bird veils it seems that outside traffic in direction 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.690
 contrary to 1 600 meters above 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 had a strong vapor trail that looked more like homo and the light in the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.239
 front was very bright lufthansa 4 0 5 with far from your side passed the traffic 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.989
 he was very close how much for flights seemed about 600 or 900 meters 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.390
 above the left wing, only a kilometer away, it looked like a pedrosa optic 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.389
 the air traffic control tower of boston contact the giant killer 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.519
 installation of a military surveillance and control fleet 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.110
 which monitors the airspace above the northeast section of the official 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.459
 they have something in the negative area 105 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.449
 back then I have a couple of opinion reports so I have a 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.959
 couple of subjects who reported lights that moved over their heads I do not have 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.379
 traffic in the area say they spent about two kilometers from them at two 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.689
 about 900 meters above them in the opposite direction 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.379
 it could have been a meteor some we do not have any aircraft atr 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.519
 both pilots confirmed that the object had lights that shone 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.329
 the object left a trail of green vapor like no trace of steam that 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.279
 have seen 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.629
 both pilots immediately questioned the idea that the UFO they had seen 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.029
 it was a lufthansa meteor 4 0 5 I would say that this was definitely not a 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:44.919
 meteorite 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:51.299
 it was slow I do not know lufthansa 400 heavy this one is clear that the two 2 6 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.439
 it could not be a meteor because it was at flight level it seemed that it was very 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.000
 Quick 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.530
 it definitely looked faster than a normal aircraft was going online 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.480
 straight at a level 4-2 point 2 6 thanks we're seeing it I mean 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.970
 we are doing a report joan we do not know what it was and the military do not 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.470
 they admit that they will fly tonight while not questioning the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.299
 authenticity of this recording the adif ea and both airlines 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.560
 they have never commented on this mysterious incident on top of new england
