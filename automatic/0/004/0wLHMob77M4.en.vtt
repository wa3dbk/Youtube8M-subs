00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
you know the endive can be a little

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.570 
you know the endive can be a little
tricky<00:05:35.570> to<00:05:36.020> stand<00:05:36.800> up<00:05:37.010> but<00:05:37.850> not<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:38.360> big<00:05:38.600> deal

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580

tricky to stand up but not a big deal
you<00:05:40.580> can<00:05:40.730> either<00:05:40.820> do<00:05:41.060> this<00:05:41.210> on<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.450> unit<00:05:42.050> maybe<00:05:42.710> a

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
you can either do this on a unit maybe a

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.230 
you can either do this on a unit maybe a
little<00:05:42.830> cleaner<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.670> do<00:05:43.820> it<00:05:43.910> on<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.030> cutting

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
little cleaner to do it on a cutting

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.120 
little cleaner to do it on a cutting
board<00:05:44.540> and<00:05:44.720> then<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.650> won't<00:05:45.830> have<00:05:45.920> it

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
board and then you won't have it

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.050 
board and then you won't have it
spilling<00:05:46.430> over<00:05:47.170> but<00:05:48.490> that's<00:05:49.490> not<00:05:49.670> the<00:05:49.850> way<00:05:49.940> I'm

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
spilling over but that's not the way I'm

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.910 
spilling over but that's not the way I'm
set<00:05:50.270> up<00:05:50.300> right<00:05:50.510> now<00:05:50.780> and<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.650> can<00:05:51.770> certainly

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
set up right now and you can certainly

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.130 
set up right now and you can certainly
transfer<00:05:52.520> these<00:05:52.640> over<00:05:52.970> or<00:05:53.270> clean<00:05:53.870> up<00:05:54.020> the

transfer these over or clean up the

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.560
