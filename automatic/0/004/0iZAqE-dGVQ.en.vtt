00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
known as porta tips which they could

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.540 
known as porta tips which they could
carry<00:02:15.120> under<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:15.630> arm<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.770> then<00:02:17.070> they

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
carry under one arm and then they

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.370 
carry under one arm and then they
constructed<00:02:18.090> larger<00:02:18.510> instruments<00:02:19.020> known<00:02:19.230> as

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
table and later on they built even

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.750 
table and later on they built even
bigger<00:02:24.930> instruments<00:02:25.290> which<00:02:26.070> filled<00:02:26.430> the

bigger instruments which filled the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.300 
bigger instruments which filled the
galleries<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.270> churches<00:02:28.040> they<00:02:29.040> then

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
galleries of churches they then

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.730 
galleries of churches they then
developed<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.000> mechanical<00:02:30.600> system<00:02:30.780> allowing

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
