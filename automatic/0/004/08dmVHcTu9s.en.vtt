00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.529
 and you can be there sooner 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.139
 we are still in Maastricht in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.179
 holland on the way and will be right after 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.880
 Home back to Germany and be 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.880
 then present our 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.740
 we were now with them - and now 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.170
 was again one at the time ever 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.340
 More things we will find on the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 eat a few 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.040
 in the supermarket and also in hemer and 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.960
 have a few things for our call 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.520
 worried we will show you now 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.860
 I have one here first 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.300
 small pink pocket mirror and also 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.160
 such a hairbrush because I think 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.050
 On the way you can always look how 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.400
 you look like the havel can sit 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.550
 then one more time by brushing 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.690
 can after powdering and yes I think 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.670
 the always island 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.650
 So I always have to use chewing gum 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 you know you are driving, yes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.910
 totally boring and yes I think you can 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.820
 finally chewing gum and having to 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.770
 to distract me a bit and yes the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.300
 Here are the theme and they taste good 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.800
 after with great people 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.080
 Of course I have to have a powder 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 it did not shine very quickly and 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.290
 Then how, for example , arrived there 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.600
 Do not you want to shit? 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.580
 I've seen a motive here a powder 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.980
 absolutely chewed on the subject if he 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.980
 dark today you can be great 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.570
 make-up data in our skin color so 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 and even cheap then I still have 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.840
 what am I so screwing up here? 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.000
 The corner does not always have to buy 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 Eating chips I have two more 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.230
 more ex things here and there once 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
 the dried fruit is a crane ba 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.560
 remakes and there are a few nuts 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
 doing that is very convenient because he 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.130
 really all sorts of nutrients off 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 and then here again the sweet ones 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.530
 sweet variation with white chocolate then 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.810
 I have two more care here 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.400
 thing and once a small deo 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.260
 which is really handy 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.750
 no aluminum salts and that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.310
 Concept in the fragrance of the waterline 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.630
 and then I have one more thing here 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.550
 you probably think so too 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.780
 many of you are right and true in 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.940
 go hand 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.650
 what is lightly infected in front of everyone 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.820
 if you were traveling a long time and 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.230
 then somehow around in the face 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.480
 come then it is better that once 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.280
 land neither before nor after 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.560
 I'll take you further away 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.450
 are'd recommend car long drives 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.459
 Here are some of these by kellogg's 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.290
 make it easy but first cream this 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.310
 really delicious and you can 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.900
 Just a little bit in between 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.700
 snatch and the saturation then also 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.409
 and that's why I'm gonna do that too 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.000
 take away for the most part 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.290
 Of course, music is also very important 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 and that's why I would always have a few 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.530
 so headphones bring you 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.549
 just a little bit in between 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.110
 music can lead 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.160
 and then the car ride is not 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.160
 so boring 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.549
 that was our roadtrip now 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.379
 essentials would be great again 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.750
 What are you really interested in 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.790
 have a bag if you have long 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.680
 car ride here below we link to you 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.629

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.560
