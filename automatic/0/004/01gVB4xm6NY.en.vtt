00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.699
 such kind of extra acid for the prince on the mud street 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.669

 in the catwalk 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.180

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.770
 they didn't do that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.030

 but of course it's the desk 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 but the click here to every year 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.269
 twelve countries like indonesia 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.589
