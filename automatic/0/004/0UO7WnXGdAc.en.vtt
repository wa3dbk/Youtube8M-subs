as well so as you can see here after
back<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.710> how<00:00:37.890> you'll<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.309> when<00:00:38.430> you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
back this is not how you'll get when you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
back this is not how you'll get when you
get<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.820> device<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.840> won't<00:00:40.110> look<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.290> this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
get your device it won't look like this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
get your device it won't look like this
it'll<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:40.920> look<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:42.210> I'll<00:00:42.390> put<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it'll actually look which I'll put it to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.900 
it'll actually look which I'll put it to
the<00:00:42.750> year<00:00:42.960> resolution<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:44.309> looked<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the year resolution it looked like that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
the year resolution it looked like that
now<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> probably<00:00:46.289> thinking<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.649> looks<00:00:46.860> bad

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
now you probably thinking that looks bad

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.940 
now you probably thinking that looks bad
that's<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:47.879> 10<00:00:48.210> megapixel<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:49.770> come

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that's actually 10 megapixel they come

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.490 
that's actually 10 megapixel they come
itself<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> 13<00:00:50.879> megapixel<00:00:51.030> sensor<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.379> what

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
itself as a 13 megapixel sensor and what

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
itself as a 13 megapixel sensor and what
you<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:52.949> crop<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> image<00:00:53.670> by

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you do is actually crop in the image by

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
you do is actually crop in the image by
doing<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.570> he<00:00:55.140> doesn't<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.469> like

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
doing this here he doesn't look like

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
doing this here he doesn't look like
it's<00:00:55.980> obviously<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.210> looks<00:00:57.390> like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's obviously you know it looks like

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
it's obviously you know it looks like
it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> bigger<00:00:58.020> image<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it's a bigger image I'm just going to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.260 
it's a bigger image I'm just going to
zoom<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.460> slightly<00:01:01.520> just<00:01:02.520> bring<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.730> other

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
zoom out slightly just bring the other

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.450 
zoom out slightly just bring the other
quick<00:01:03.480> close<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> show<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
quick close so just to show you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.380 
quick close so just to show you
obviously<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.180> there

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
obviously you know you see that there

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.960 
obviously you know you see that there
now<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.500> change<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.070> image<00:01:08.189> actual

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
now if i change the image actual

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
now if i change the image actual
resolution<00:01:09.740> hopefully<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.830> gonna<00:01:10.950> show<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
resolution hopefully it's gonna show you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
resolution hopefully it's gonna show you
you<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.510> more<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you have to get more of that you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
you have to get more of that you
actually<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.530> more<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.010> top<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.490> not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually get more the top it's not

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
actually get more the top it's not
basically<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> knockout<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.409> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
basically it's knockout as you see they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.980 
basically it's knockout as you see they
see<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> top<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.990> selfish

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
see that they're at the top now selfish

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
see that they're at the top now selfish
earlier<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> town<00:01:21.299> 10

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
earlier so if I now go down to town 10

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
earlier so if I now go down to town 10
megapixel<00:01:22.229> by<00:01:22.920> filling<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.280> their<00:01:23.460> watched

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
megapixel by filling out their watched

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.960 
megapixel by filling out their watched
I'll<00:01:24.270> disappear<00:01:24.720> boom<00:01:25.710> she<00:01:26.369> actually<00:01:26.549> crops

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I'll disappear boom she actually crops

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
I'll disappear boom she actually crops
the<00:01:27.150> image<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.920> sooner<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> get

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
picture so you can see there is taking a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.190 
picture so you can see there is taking a
picture<00:03:54.269> straight<00:03:54.510> away<00:03:56.360> ok<00:03:57.360> take<00:03:57.690> another

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
picture straight away ok take another

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.620 
picture straight away ok take another
picture<00:03:58.440> don't<00:03:59.040> knock<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.519> will<00:04:00.480> try

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
picture don't knock on that will try

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.199 
picture don't knock on that will try
again<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.769> we'll<00:04:02.010> turn<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.250> screen<00:04:02.430> off<00:04:02.580> so

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
again so we'll turn the screen off so

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.520 
again so we'll turn the screen off so
you<00:04:03.330> can<00:04:03.420> see<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.810> I'm<00:04:03.989> taking<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.350> picture

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
you can see is this I'm taking a picture

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.539 
you can see is this I'm taking a picture
off<00:04:04.680> not<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:06.690> one<00:04:07.650> two<00:04:07.890> three<00:04:08.130> tap<00:04:08.400> it

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
off not that so one two three tap it

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.729 
off not that so one two three tap it
once<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.780> large<00:04:10.140> straight<00:04:10.500> away<00:04:10.620> this

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
once and it is large straight away this

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.539 
once and it is large straight away this
time<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.880> hopefully<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.989> time<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:14.160> taking<00:04:14.489> a

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
time and hopefully this time is taking a

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.780 
time and hopefully this time is taking a
picture<00:04:14.810> but<00:04:15.810> as<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.410> saw<00:04:16.560> previously<00:04:16.919> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
picture but as you saw previously it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.310 
picture but as you saw previously it
doesn't<00:04:18.060> always<00:04:18.180> take<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.870> picture<00:04:19.140> first

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
doesn't always take the picture first

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.840 
doesn't always take the picture first
time<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.709> probably<00:04:20.040> seats<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.459> pretty<00:04:20.729> nice

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
time I probably seats in pretty nice

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.020 
time I probably seats in pretty nice
clear<00:04:21.209> image<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.830> doesn't<00:04:23.039> always<00:04:23.130> work<00:04:23.430> and

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
clear image it doesn't always work and

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.450 
clear image it doesn't always work and
I'd<00:04:24.539> honest<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.990> why<00:04:25.140> sometimes<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.160> got<00:04:26.370> it

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460

need to press it once so don't know that

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160 
need to press it once so don't know that
the<00:04:38.250> software<00:04:38.460> both<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.000> need<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.300> fix<00:04:39.540> but

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
the software both the need to fix but

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.450 
the software both the need to fix but
hopefully<00:04:40.560> going<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.770> fix<00:04:40.920> in<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.160> future

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
hopefully going to fix in a future

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.940 
hopefully going to fix in a future
update<00:04:41.520> because<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.420> their<00:04:42.630> name<00:04:42.950> anyway

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950

off we go let's go back into the
settings<00:04:47.030> it's<00:04:48.030> obviously<00:04:48.270> they're<00:04:48.450> all<00:04:48.600> the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
settings it's obviously they're all the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.210 
settings it's obviously they're all the
same<00:04:48.720> spectral<00:04:49.290> you<00:04:49.470> know<00:04:49.560> comer<00:04:49.860> itself

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
same spectral you know comer itself

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.840 
same spectral you know comer itself
that's<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.640> there's<00:04:50.820> no<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.150> kind<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:52.850> kind

that's it there's no of a kind of kind

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.490 
that's it there's no of a kind of kind
of<00:04:53.970> setting<00:04:54.360> itself<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:55.080> we're<00:04:55.230> going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.440> do

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
of setting itself so we're going to do

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.820 
of setting itself so we're going to do
now<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.860> go<00:04:56.160> back<00:04:56.460> switch<00:04:57.420> to<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.600> video<00:04:57.840> now

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
now is go back switch to the video now

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.500 
now is go back switch to the video now

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
exposure value which I'm very impressed

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.010 
exposure value which I'm very impressed
by<00:05:59.340> this<00:05:59.400> so<00:06:00.090> as<00:06:00.180> an<00:06:00.270> example<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.810> comes

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
by this so as an example it comes

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.380 
by this so as an example it comes
default<00:06:01.500> as<00:06:01.620> this<00:06:01.820> now<00:06:02.820> if<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:03.000> look<00:06:03.090> at<00:06:03.240> that

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
default as this now if you look at that

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.500 
default as this now if you look at that
it<00:06:03.870> looks<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.500> bit<00:06:04.740> wishy-washy<00:06:05.510> especially

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510

look<00:06:06.720> at<00:06:06.780> that<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.080> color<00:06:07.290> here<00:06:07.500> up<00:06:07.590> to<00:06:07.740> there

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
look at that to a color here up to there

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.240 
look at that to a color here up to there
so<00:06:08.880> if<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.570> go<00:06:09.750> into<00:06:10.020> your<00:06:10.229> exposure<00:06:10.919> value

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
so if you go into your exposure value

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.420 
so if you go into your exposure value
what<00:06:12.120> you<00:06:12.240> can<00:06:12.450> do<00:06:12.690> is<00:06:12.900> I'll<00:06:13.650> show<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:14.040> bring

obviously shut us down as well so that's
it<00:07:05.820> that's<00:07:06.000> the<00:07:06.150> camera<00:07:06.510> application<00:07:07.080> on<00:07:07.530> the

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
child petition itself it's kind of nice

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.490 
child petition itself it's kind of nice
to<00:07:14.340> Ladell<00:07:14.820> not<00:07:15.480> massive<00:07:15.870> fan<00:07:16.050> of<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.200> menu

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
to Ladell not massive fan of the menu

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.930 
to Ladell not massive fan of the menu
system<00:07:16.920> they<00:07:17.160> could<00:07:17.370> have<00:07:17.460> made<00:07:17.610> it<00:07:17.640> a<00:07:17.790> bit

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
system they could have made it a bit

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.790 
system they could have made it a bit
more<00:07:17.970> menu<00:07:18.420> within<00:07:18.600> just<00:07:18.930> big<00:07:19.260> block<00:07:19.530> bones

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
more menu within just big block bones

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.830 
more menu within just big block bones
but<00:07:20.160> I<00:07:20.430> guess<00:07:20.940> it's<00:07:21.150> enough<00:07:21.420> for<00:07:21.450> making<00:07:21.780> it

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
but I guess it's enough for making it

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.980 
but I guess it's enough for making it
easier<00:07:22.500> kind<00:07:22.740> of<00:07:22.830> use<00:07:23.120> but<00:07:24.120> yeah<00:07:24.300> that's<00:07:24.780> it

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
easier kind of use but yeah that's it

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.210 
easier kind of use but yeah that's it
