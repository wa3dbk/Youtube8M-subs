should<00:01:49.249> fit<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:49.759> bill<00:01:49.969> next<00:01:50.749> up<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.169> had<00:01:51.319> to<00:01:51.439> cut

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
should fit the bill next up I had to cut

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.409 
should fit the bill next up I had to cut
out<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.770> piece<00:01:52.069> of<00:01:52.249> scrap<00:01:52.579> wood<00:01:52.609> to<00:01:52.880> use<00:01:53.060> as

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:53.419 
out a piece of scrap wood to use as

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:55.779 
out a piece of scrap wood to use as
support<00:01:53.929> behind<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.709> sheet<00:01:54.979> metal<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:55.549> that

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
support behind the sheet metal and that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.690 
support behind the sheet metal and that
looks<00:01:56.060> like<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.569> should<00:01:56.899> work<00:01:57.139> out<00:01:57.669> so<00:01:58.669> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
looks like that should work out so I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.800 
looks like that should work out so I
went<00:01:58.969> ahead<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.329> drilled<00:01:59.509> some<00:01:59.779> holes

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
went ahead and drilled some holes

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.539 
went ahead and drilled some holes
through<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.380> sheet<00:02:00.619> metal<00:02:00.919> and<00:02:01.039> wood<00:02:01.310> and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
through the sheet metal and wood and

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.309 
through the sheet metal and wood and
then<00:02:01.669> I<00:02:01.759> put<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.060> bracket<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.599> and<00:02:02.929> screw<00:02:03.169> the

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
then I put the bracket on and screw the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.229 
then I put the bracket on and screw the
screws<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:03.859> guess<00:02:04.249> what<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.789> went<00:02:05.090> on

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
screws on and guess what it went on

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.070 
screws on and guess what it went on
solid<00:02:05.919> but<00:02:06.919> the<00:02:07.429> main<00:02:07.639> problem<00:02:07.819> is<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.539> mounted

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
solid but the main problem is I mounted

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.809 
solid but the main problem is I mounted
it<00:02:09.200> too<00:02:09.349> low<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.860> bed<00:02:10.039> would<00:02:10.220> not<00:02:10.399> fold<00:02:10.640> up

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
it too low and the bed would not fold up

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.640 
it too low and the bed would not fold up
completely<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.510> had<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.810> remount<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.380> higher

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
completely so I had to remount it higher

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.050 
completely so I had to remount it higher
and<00:02:13.210> here's<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.420> end<00:02:14.450> result<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.440> were

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and here's the end result it were

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.080 
and here's the end result it were
doubt<00:02:16.410> absolutely<00:02:17.410> perfect<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.430> couldn't

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
doubt absolutely perfect I couldn't

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.420 
doubt absolutely perfect I couldn't
answer<00:02:19.270> any<00:02:19.569> better<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.170> folded<00:02:20.950> up<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> bed

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
answer any better I folded up the bed

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.680 
answer any better I folded up the bed
and<00:02:21.730> guess<00:02:22.690> what<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.530> was<00:02:24.370> able<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.730> latch<00:02:24.970> so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
and guess what it was able to latch so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.170 
and guess what it was able to latch so
there<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.350> bed<00:02:26.560> now<00:02:26.800> conceals<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.700> TV<00:02:28.060> and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
there the bed now conceals the TV and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.050 
there the bed now conceals the TV and
also<00:02:28.569> protects<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.140> TV<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.590> well<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.760> not

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
also protects the TV as well so it not

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.479 
also protects the TV as well so it not
only<00:02:31.240> hides<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.870> TV<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> saves<00:02:32.800> space<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
only hides a TV but it saves space and

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.690 
only hides a TV but it saves space and
protects<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> TV<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:36.160> finished<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
protects the TV and I finished the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
protects the TV and I finished the
install<00:02:37.180> by<00:02:37.510> putting<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.110> cover<00:02:38.319> plates
