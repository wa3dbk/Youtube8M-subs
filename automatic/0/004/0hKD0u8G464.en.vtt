years<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.369> technology<00:00:32.930> but<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.020> wants

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
years with the technology but it wants

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
years with the technology but it wants

now<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> new<00:00:40.140> Panasonic<00:00:40.710> 4k<00:00:41.129> TV<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> see

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
now the new Panasonic 4k TV you see

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.420 
now the new Panasonic 4k TV you see
behind<00:00:41.910> me<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.750> an<00:00:42.930> LED<00:00:43.500> model<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
behind me is an LED model and the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.090 
behind me is an LED model and the
difference<00:00:44.700> between<00:00:44.789> LED<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.510> plasma

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
difference between LED and plasma

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.380 
difference between LED and plasma
particularly<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.280> picture<00:00:47.550> enthusiasts<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
particularly for picture enthusiasts is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
particularly for picture enthusiasts is
that<00:00:48.899> plasma<00:00:49.410> tends<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.890> much<00:00:50.100> deeper

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that plasma tends to have much deeper

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.689 
that plasma tends to have much deeper
blacks<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> arguably<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.500> vibrant<00:00:53.309> colors

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
blacks and arguably more vibrant colors

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.209 
blacks and arguably more vibrant colors
with<00:00:54.480> LED<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> brighter<00:00:55.500> picture<00:00:55.770> so

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
with LED you get a brighter picture so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
with LED you get a brighter picture so
it<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> bit<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> dispatch<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it was kind of a bit of dispatch you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.380 
it was kind of a bit of dispatch you
weren't<00:00:58.109> getting<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> best<00:00:58.829> from<00:00:59.160> both

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
weren't getting it the best from both

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.209 
weren't getting it the best from both
what<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> Sonics<00:01:01.199> tried<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.890> bring

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
what kind of Sonics tried to do is bring

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.369 
what kind of Sonics tried to do is bring
all<00:01:02.489> those<00:01:02.609> good<00:01:02.940> elements<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> plasma<00:01:03.840> into

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
all those good elements of plasma into

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.580 
all those good elements of plasma into
the<00:01:04.589> 4k<00:01:05.070> models<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:06.330> done<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.630> by<00:01:06.900> taking<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the 4k models it's done this by taking a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.830 
the 4k models it's done this by taking a
technology<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.360> make<00:01:09.510> deep

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
technology in you that can make deep

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
technology in you that can make deep
blacks<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:10.950> beautiful<00:01:11.310> vibrant

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
blacks and can make beautiful vibrant

blacks and can make beautiful vibrant
colors<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.360> try<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> integrate<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.070> an

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
colors and try to integrate them into an

top rated one from last year and its new

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
top rated one from last year and its new
4k<00:01:23.460> LED<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.360> we've<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> say<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
4k LED and we've got to say the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.080 
4k LED and we've got to say the
difference<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.100> pretty<00:01:26.340> minimal<00:01:26.759> between

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
difference was pretty minimal between

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.240 
difference was pretty minimal between
the<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> trade<00:01:28.979> show

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the two but this is a trade show

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
the two but this is a trade show
understand<00:01:29.729> under<00:01:29.939> Panasonic's<00:01:30.540> conditions

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
understand under Panasonic's conditions

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
understand under Panasonic's conditions
so<00:01:31.560> we'll<00:01:31.860> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> lab<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.790> be

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so we'll need to get it in the lab to be

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.240 
so we'll need to get it in the lab to be
truly<00:01:33.090> sure<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.200> panasonic<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.070> going

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
truly sure so panasonic is really going

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.010 
truly sure so panasonic is really going
