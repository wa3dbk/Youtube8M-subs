evolving spark network is an
installation<00:00:07.399> and<00:00:07.519> interactive

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
installation and interactive

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.990 
installation and interactive
installation<00:00:08.420> that<00:00:09.200> uses<00:00:09.610> electrical<00:00:10.610> sparks

installation that uses electrical sparks
both<00:00:11.420> for<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:11.750> sound<00:00:11.930> production<00:00:12.350> and<00:00:12.559> for

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
both for the sound production and for

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.640 
both for the sound production and for
the<00:00:13.400> four<00:00:13.820> light<00:00:13.969> production<00:00:14.420> so<00:00:15.410> it<00:00:15.469> means

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
the four light production so it means

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.370 
the four light production so it means
they<00:00:15.889> actually<00:00:16.449> are<00:00:17.449> dead<00:00:17.630> strong<00:00:17.930> that<00:00:18.260> they

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
they actually are dead strong that they

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.950 
they actually are dead strong that they
really<00:00:18.590> produces<00:00:19.130> drops<00:00:19.340> copic<00:00:19.609> flesh<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:20.150> at

the<00:00:37.249> installation<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:37.789> network<00:00:38.359> of<00:00:38.600> these

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
the installation is a network of these

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.809 
the installation is a network of these
poor<00:00:39.559> creatures<00:00:39.649> above<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.280> audience<00:00:40.609> and

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
poor creatures above the audience and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.619 
poor creatures above the audience and
here<00:00:41.719> in<00:00:41.870> v2<00:00:42.319> what<00:00:42.530> will<00:00:42.710> be<00:00:43.329> will<00:00:44.329> have<00:00:44.510> in

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
here in v2 what will be will have in

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.569 
here in v2 what will be will have in
height<00:00:44.839> of<00:00:45.140> approximately<00:00:45.429> four<00:00:46.429> and<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:46.550> half

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
height of approximately four and a half

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.719 
height of approximately four and a half
meters<00:00:47.289> it's<00:00:48.289> reverses<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.829> whole<00:00:48.949> space<00:00:49.159> so

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
meters it's reverses the whole space so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.389 
meters it's reverses the whole space so
it's<00:00:50.059> not<00:00:50.239> let's<00:00:50.600> say<00:00:50.749> an<00:00:50.870> installation<00:00:51.409> just

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
it's not let's say an installation just

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.399 
it's not let's say an installation just
in<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.760> space<00:00:52.999> but<00:00:53.389> you<00:00:53.539> could<00:00:53.690> say<00:00:53.839> that<00:00:54.050> the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
in a space but you could say that the

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.979 
in a space but you could say that the
space<00:00:54.649> transforms<00:00:55.420> completely<00:00:56.420> by<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.659> by

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
space transforms completely by the by

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.430 
space transforms completely by the by
the<00:00:57.139> installation<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.249> the<00:00:58.370> installation<00:00:59.440> it

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
the installation so the installation it

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.869 
the installation so the installation it
creates<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.799> whole<00:01:00.979> new<00:01:01.010> environment<00:01:01.219> in<00:01:01.699> there

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
creates a whole new environment in there

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.600 
creates a whole new environment in there
and<00:01:02.149> environment<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:04.010> audience<00:01:04.339> has<00:01:04.519> to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
and environment that the audience has to

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.920 
and environment that the audience has to
relate<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:04.940> relates<00:01:05.299> itself<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.780> its

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
relate it relates itself to its

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.260 
relate it relates itself to its
interactive<00:01:06.500> but<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:07.190> also<00:01:07.430> generative<00:01:08.060> so

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
interactive but it's also generative so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.300 
interactive but it's also generative so
in<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.420> sense<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.229> will<00:01:09.350> keep<00:01:09.649> on<00:01:09.829> functioning

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
in a sense it will keep on functioning

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.910 
in a sense it will keep on functioning
but<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:10.789> audience<00:01:11.149> can<00:01:11.329> really<00:01:11.689> initiate<00:01:12.649> and

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
but the audience can really initiate and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.029 
but the audience can really initiate and
put<00:01:13.369> energy<00:01:13.549> into<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.119> network<00:01:14.799> or<00:01:15.799> sprite

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
put energy into the network or sprite

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.459 
put energy into the network or sprite
riches<00:01:16.479> what<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.600> happening<00:01:17.930> they're<00:01:18.110> all

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
riches what is happening they're all

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.539 
riches what is happening they're all
different<00:01:18.740> kinds<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:19.039> bathrooms<00:01:19.430> the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
different kinds of bathrooms the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.179 
different kinds of bathrooms the
patterns<00:01:19.850> are<00:01:19.969> changing<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.539> evolving<00:01:21.189> but

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
patterns are changing and evolving but

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.760 
patterns are changing and evolving but
in<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.490> sense<00:01:23.740> each<00:01:24.740> pipe<00:01:25.100> rich<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.549> space<00:01:25.820> is

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
in a sense each pipe rich in space is

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.170 
in a sense each pipe rich in space is
communicating<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.859> its<00:01:27.979> neighbors<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.490> like

the<00:01:45.289> fee<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.560> space<00:01:45.859> is<00:01:46.570> sighs<00:01:47.570> fight<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:48.020> ideal

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
the fee to space is sighs fight in ideal

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.889 
the fee to space is sighs fight in ideal
space<00:01:48.789> because<00:01:49.789> it's<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.329> really<00:01:50.749> has<00:01:50.869> a

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
space because it's it really has a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.289 
space because it's it really has a
considerable<00:01:51.200> size<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.189> means<00:01:52.429> that

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.919 

you<00:01:56.299> as<00:01:56.749> member<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.590> audience<00:01:58.749> it's<00:01:59.749> quite

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
you as member in the audience it's quite

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.090 
you as member in the audience it's quite
a<00:01:59.960> distance<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.439> other<00:02:00.649> people<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.009> the

a distance to other people in the
audience<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.549> that's<00:02:01.819> very<00:02:01.969> nice<00:02:02.210> because

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
audience and that's very nice because

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.599 
audience and that's very nice because
that<00:02:02.689> creates<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.429> installation<00:02:04.429> then

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
that creates the installation then

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.219 
that creates the installation then
creates<00:02:04.939> possibility<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.569> communicate<00:02:05.990> with

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
creates possibility to communicate with

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.569 
creates possibility to communicate with
each<00:02:06.259> other<00:02:06.530> through<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.429> installation

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
each other through the installation

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.820 
each other through the installation
itself<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:09.080> hear<00:02:09.319> all<00:02:09.530> these<00:02:09.619> different

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
itself you hear all these different

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.550 
itself you hear all these different
sounding<00:02:10.819> patterns<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:11.720> visually<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:12.380> also

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
sounding patterns but visually it's also

you<00:02:19.520> see<00:02:19.640> light<00:02:19.820> behind<00:02:19.970> me<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:20.360> at<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
you see light behind me but at the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.050 
you see light behind me but at the
moment<00:02:20.690> there's<00:02:21.410> flesh<00:02:21.710> in<00:02:22.250> front<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> me<00:02:22.790> all

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
moment there's flesh in front of me all

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.540 
moment there's flesh in front of me all
of<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.420> sudden<00:02:23.630> I'm<00:02:23.750> lead<00:02:23.930> from<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.170> front

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
of a sudden I'm lead from the front

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
of a sudden I'm lead from the front
which<00:02:25.550> gives<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.880> completely<00:02:26.300> different

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
which gives a completely different

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.820 
which gives a completely different
perspective<00:02:26.720> could<00:02:27.080> also<00:02:27.230> be<00:02:27.410> from<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> side

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
perspective could also be from the side

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.280 
perspective could also be from the side
so<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.070> actually<00:02:28.370> see<00:02:28.760> all<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.810> time<00:02:29.990> very

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
so you actually see all the time very

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.670 
so you actually see all the time very
dynamic<00:02:32.440> changing<00:02:33.440> light<00:02:34.160> environment<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:35.680> in

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
dynamic changing light environment to in

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.840 
dynamic changing light environment to in
a<00:02:36.740> sense<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.130> installation<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.610> strongly

get been in the museum that piece is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.910 
get been in the museum that piece is
also<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.840> great<00:02:48.110> above<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> audience<00:02:48.830> in

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
also the great above the audience in

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.040 
also the great above the audience in
this<00:02:49.100> in<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.550> case<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:50.060> grid<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.660> pneumatic

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
this in that case a grid of pneumatic

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.710 
this in that case a grid of pneumatic
valves<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.680> there<00:02:52.310> i<00:02:52.340> used<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.000> compressed

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
valves and there i used the compressed

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.080 
valves and there i used the compressed
air<00:02:53.840> including<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.530> valves<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.940> produce

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
air including the valves to produce

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.210 
air including the valves to produce
sound<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.080> i<00:02:57.110> learned<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.830> got<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> lot<00:02:58.190> of

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
sound so i learned and got a lot of

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.400 
sound so i learned and got a lot of
experience<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.820> working<00:02:59.420> with<00:02:59.600> sound<00:02:59.959> in<00:03:00.230> such

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
experience of working with sound in such

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.510 
experience of working with sound in such
a<00:03:00.440> way<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.510> i<00:03:02.510> learned<00:03:03.380> how<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:04.010> deal<00:03:04.220> with<00:03:04.400> it

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
a way and i learned how to deal with it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.190 
a way and i learned how to deal with it
and<00:03:04.700> actually<00:03:05.180> there<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.810> insulation

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
and actually there in that insulation

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.720 
and actually there in that insulation
there's<00:03:06.470> no<00:03:06.590> visual<00:03:06.860> aspect<00:03:07.190> except<00:03:07.459> for<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
there's no visual aspect except for the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.060 
there's no visual aspect except for the
construction<00:03:07.940> being<00:03:08.330> there<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.650> possible

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
construction being there it is possible

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.940 
construction being there it is possible
to<00:03:10.130> really<00:03:10.810> create<00:03:11.810> completely<00:03:12.560> new<00:03:12.709> space

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
to really create completely new space

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.110 
to really create completely new space
within<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.670> existing<00:03:13.880> space<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.280> really<00:03:16.880> only

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
within the existing space so really only

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.789 
within the existing space so really only
by<00:03:17.330> means<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.630> sound<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:18.020> can<00:03:18.200> transform<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
by means of sound you can transform the

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.940 
by means of sound you can transform the
space<00:03:19.150> drastically<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:23.230> we're<00:03:24.230> there<00:03:24.680> it's

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
space drastically but we're there it's

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
space drastically but we're there it's
more<00:03:25.250> work<00:03:25.670> more<00:03:25.700> with<00:03:26.030> compositions<00:03:26.630> and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
more work more with compositions and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.170 
more work more with compositions and
where<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.049> work<00:03:27.440> with<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.620> heretical<00:03:28.220> control<00:03:28.910> of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
where I work with a heretical control of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.350 
where I work with a heretical control of
a<00:03:29.690> system<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.290> controls<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.190> valves<00:03:31.519> here<00:03:32.330> I

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
a system that controls the valves here I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.479 
a system that controls the valves here I
work<00:03:32.750> more<00:03:32.989> with<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:34.100> could<00:03:34.250> say<00:03:34.370> an

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
work more with you could say an

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.410 
work more with you could say an
autonomous<00:03:35.140> system<00:03:36.140> where<00:03:36.350> each<00:03:36.709> cell<00:03:37.640> in

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
autonomous system where each cell in

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.190 
autonomous system where each cell in
this<00:03:38.600> case<00:03:38.810> each<00:03:38.989> part<00:03:39.290> bridge<00:03:39.470> bridge<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:41.200> is

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
this case each part bridge bridge and is

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.620 
this case each part bridge bridge and is
communicating<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.860> its<00:03:42.980> neighbor<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.630> content

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
communicating to its neighbor so content

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.690 
communicating to its neighbor so content
wise<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:45.019> very<00:03:45.230> different<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:46.430> also<00:03:46.580> an

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
wise is very different it's also an

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.100 
wise is very different it's also an
interactive<00:03:47.120> piece<00:03:47.299> which<00:03:47.570> also<00:03:47.750> makes<00:03:47.989> this

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
interactive piece which also makes this

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.650 
interactive piece which also makes this
very<00:03:48.230> different<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:49.190> although<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:50.360> could<00:03:50.510> say

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
very different so although you could say

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.720 
very different so although you could say
the<00:03:50.780> setup<00:03:51.140> is<00:03:51.290> very<00:03:51.320> comparable<00:03:51.769> at<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.640> same

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
the setup is very comparable at the same

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.150 
the setup is very comparable at the same
time<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:53.000> challenge<00:03:53.540> myself<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:54.380> deal<00:03:54.980> with

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
time I challenge myself to deal with

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.789 
time I challenge myself to deal with
content<00:03:55.580> in<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.790> completely<00:03:56.060> different<00:03:56.150> way<00:03:56.799> it

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
content in a completely different way it

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.320 
content in a completely different way it
made<00:03:57.980> me<00:03:58.100> think<00:03:59.230> but<00:04:00.230> yeah<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.850> simply<00:04:01.850> working

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
made me think but yeah I simply working

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.949 
made me think but yeah I simply working
with<00:04:02.600> this<00:04:02.720> made<00:04:02.930> me<00:04:03.049> think<00:04:03.080> again<00:04:03.380> about<00:04:03.530> how

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
with this made me think again about how

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.320 
with this made me think again about how
cells<00:04:05.959> in<00:04:06.950> our<00:04:07.070> body<00:04:07.459> communicate<00:04:08.120> with<00:04:08.269> each

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
cells in our body communicate with each

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.300 
cells in our body communicate with each
other<00:04:08.480> sometimes<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.530> really<00:04:09.709> like<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.130> think

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
other sometimes I really like to think

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.600 
other sometimes I really like to think
about<00:04:10.400> space<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:10.970> body<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:12.010> how<00:04:13.010> does<00:04:13.370> that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
about space as a body so how does that

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.240 
about space as a body so how does that
work<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.209> space<00:04:14.450> as<00:04:14.690> body<00:04:15.019> or<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.890> body<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.190> a

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
work the space as body or the body is a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.610 
work the space as body or the body is a
space<00:04:16.549> could<00:04:16.820> be<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.390> other<00:04:17.479> way<00:04:17.630> around<00:04:17.660> yeah

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
space could be the other way around yeah

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.310 
space could be the other way around yeah
so

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
so

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.080 
so
here<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:19.890> can<00:04:19.980> say<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.490> is<00:04:20.580> more<00:04:20.730> displace

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
here you can say that is more displace

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.320 
here you can say that is more displace
as<00:04:21.270> body<00:04:21.480> than<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.810> body<00:04:21.990> of<00:04:22.140> space<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:23.330> these

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
as body than the body of space but these

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.000 
as body than the body of space but these
are<00:04:24.450> interesting<00:04:24.780> metaphor<00:04:24.930> for<00:04:25.260> me<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:28.010> so

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
are interesting metaphor for me and so

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.670 
are interesting metaphor for me and so
I've<00:04:29.100> been<00:04:29.250> studying<00:04:29.520> also<00:04:31.070> algorithms<00:04:32.090> for

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
I've been studying also algorithms for

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.710 
I've been studying also algorithms for
learning<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.770> networks<00:04:35.190> for<00:04:35.520> how<00:04:36.270> networks

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
learning of networks for how networks

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.410 
learning of networks for how networks
communicate<00:04:37.170> what's<00:04:37.820> what<00:04:38.820> signals<00:04:39.180> to

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
communicate what's what signals to

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.030 
communicate what's what signals to
propagate<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.140> continue<00:04:40.620> within<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.920> network

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
propagate and continue within a network

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.940 
propagate and continue within a network
and<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:42.170> stops<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:44.010> use<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:45.650> as<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.710> way

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
and what stops and I use this as a way

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.300 
and what stops and I use this as a way
to<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:48.300> create<00:04:48.810> different<00:04:49.310> textures

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
to it create different textures

00:04:50.310 --> 00:05:05.860 
to it create different textures
different<00:04:50.640> patterns<00:04:51.210> within<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.200> network

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.930
