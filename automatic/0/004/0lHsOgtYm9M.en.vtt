 videos of today thanks to

 you gave great support with the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.320
 first video of how to get medals 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.330
 or nyse in a simple way 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.860
 I wanted to bring you a second part or a 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.019
 second episode and this time 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.260
 we will start getting the medal 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.420
 heavy weapons index this consists of 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.070
 make withdrawals with any type of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.170
 heavy weapon and for that we 're going to 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.989
 have to locate in the main campaign 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.850
 of gears of war jones mind already being 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.040
 within it we select one or the other 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.769
 future and we 're going to the last part that 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.080
 is the present within them 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.970
 we locate in section number 3 that goes to 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.199
 be the terrace as you already know 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.180
 we will have to place ourselves in the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.310
 difficulty that you like where you 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.350
 feel more comfortable playing if they let me 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.659
 recommend something to use it in informal 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 good normal to advance as fast 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.670
 possible and from there we started 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.530
 newly started after this part 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.480
 to have gone through the first section 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.430
 killing all the wretches to 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.530
 through the stairs you can come across 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.330
 on the left with the turret in this 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.100
 you have to take it and followed this 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.200
 the control point will then appear 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.480
 you'll get quite unfortunate lambert 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 in big waves if you chose one 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.160
 low normal or casual difficulty you 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.170
 it will be very easy to kill them you only have 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.240
 to repeat the checkpoint again and 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.400
 again until they get the medal or 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.870
 nyse of heavy weapons possibly 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.370
 when you organize the control point you 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.410
 they will be able to attack some traumas 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.240
 only checks the control point one 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.070
 Again, since it is very common in gears of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.020
 war who fear that the monsters will change 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.740
 this waves to make the game a lot 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.740
 more fun 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.790
 well, continuing with this video the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.680
 next mesh is that we are going to be able 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 get going to be something special since 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.820
 will allow us to get three 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.190
 onís medals at the same time and these 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.740
 are the explosives medals along with 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.990
 Grenadier teacher and finally the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.520
 of locator all these we will be able to 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.710
 get through the campaign 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080
 more stars or repercussions we 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.600
 we will place in it and choose to choose 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.700
 a new section within it we 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.370
 we will locate in the part or in the section 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.170
 number two there is someone at home like 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.150
 you already know is in the difficulty 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.480
 where you feel more comfortable 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.480
 to play 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.830
 I just started this part when 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.020
 you get to the generator that stops 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.580
 they started attacking humans the mind 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.830
 As in the previous guide, you will have to 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.930
 wait for them to go down to the 3 bots of your 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.420
 team but while you wait you can go 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.370
 dialing 1 to 1 to advance in the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.680
 locator medal already when this 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.810
 team is shot down the enemies will go 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.180
 directly to you a few seconds 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.489
 before you're going to die hit him 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.780
 granada to any of them and you'll get a 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.580
 heap of badges 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 you will also advance for the other two 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.060
 onís medals that are those of 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.640
 grenadier and explosives 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.810
 only repeats the point over and over again 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.239
 of control doing the same 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.690
 procedure until you get all your 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.690
 medals 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.040
 before finally finishing this same 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.200
 section can also help us with 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.849
 enough medals more since the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.579
 human the mind are very easy to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.590
 kill and die in one fell swoop this you 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.079
 can be used to get the medals 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.150
 or nyse of weapons that well almost not 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.799
 use in the multiplayer how could 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 be the normal spear and the shotgun 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.209
 cropped that come by default when 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.310

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.530
 retro lancer that is hidden as 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.870

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.940

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.010
 melee attack as I have 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.109

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.269

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.700
 hit and it's up to you to take advantage 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.680
