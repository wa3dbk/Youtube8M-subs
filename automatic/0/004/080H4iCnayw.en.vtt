00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.579 

okay<00:00:02.370> we'll<00:00:02.520> draw<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:03.510> block<00:00:03.780> again<00:00:04.140> today

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay we'll draw this block again today

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.590 
okay we'll draw this block again today
we're<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> draw<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.879> planimetric

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
we're going to draw it in planimetric

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.379 
we're going to draw it in planimetric
projection<00:00:07.410> now<00:00:08.099> planimetric<00:00:08.610> suggest<00:00:09.300> that

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
projection now planimetric suggest that

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.150 
projection now planimetric suggest that
you're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> draw<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.200> plan<00:00:10.500> that's

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
you're going to draw the plan that's

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.039 
you're going to draw the plan that's
exactly<00:00:11.610> what<00:00:11.730> you're<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.929> it's

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
exactly what you're going to do but it's

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.259 
exactly what you're going to do but it's
a<00:00:13.110> pictorial<00:00:13.559> convention<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.969> see

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
a pictorial convention so you can see

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.510 
a pictorial convention so you can see
the<00:00:15.509> height<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> objects<00:00:16.529> as<00:00:16.650> well<00:00:16.800> so

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the height of the objects as well so

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.279 
the height of the objects as well so
we're<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> rotate<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.170> know

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
we're going to rotate it you know

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550 
we're going to rotate it you know
sometimes<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.640> rotated<00:00:21.270> through<00:00:21.600> 45

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
sometimes it's rotated through 45

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650 
sometimes it's rotated through 45
degrees<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.369> sometimes<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.090> rotated

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
degrees and sometimes it's rotated

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
degrees and sometimes it's rotated
through<00:00:24.960> 30<00:00:25.470> degrees<00:00:26.060> we're<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> rotate

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
through 30 degrees we're going to rotate

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169 
through 30 degrees we're going to rotate
it<00:00:27.810> through<00:00:27.960> 45<00:00:28.590> degrees<00:00:29.010> today<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.000> very

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it through 45 degrees today so the very

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.930 
it through 45 degrees today so the very
first<00:00:30.390> thing<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.599> need<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> draw<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.550> plan

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
first thing I need to draw is the plan

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.180 
first thing I need to draw is the plan
of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.870> object<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:37.879> we'll<00:00:38.879> start<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.450> our

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
of the object so we'll start with our

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.020 
of the object so we'll start with our
position<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.309> X<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> down<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:44.030> all

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
position of X which is down here and all

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.369 
position of X which is down here and all
I<00:00:45.059> need<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.510> measure<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> length<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I need to do is measure the length and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
I need to do is measure the length and
the<00:00:46.739> width<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.730> object

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the width of the object

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.459 
the width of the object
well<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> object<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> hundred

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
well this object is a hundred

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:04.500 
well this object is a hundred
millimeters<00:00:52.469> long<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.059> 50<00:00:54.690> meters<00:00:56.480> wide

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.380 

okay<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:07.340> only<00:01:07.370> other<00:01:07.640> detail<00:01:08.030> I've<00:01:08.180> got

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
okay and the only other detail I've got

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.260 
okay and the only other detail I've got
on<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.630> plan<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:09.680> shoulder<00:01:10.150> here<00:01:11.150> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
on the plan is this shoulder here and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.469 
on the plan is this shoulder here and
the<00:01:11.960> start<00:01:12.260> of<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.470> slope<00:01:12.800> side<00:01:13.220> here<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.390> I'm

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the start of this slope side here so I'm

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.490 
the start of this slope side here so I'm
going<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.660> have<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.870> put<00:01:15.020> though<00:01:15.200> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
going to have to put though that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.480 
going to have to put though that
information<00:01:16.040> on<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.340> plan<00:01:16.610> which<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:18.490> 30

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
information on to the plan which is 30

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.670 
information on to the plan which is 30
millimeters<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.270> 40<00:01:20.869> millimeters<00:01:21.380> from<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
millimeters and 40 millimeters from the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.310 
millimeters and 40 millimeters from the
end<00:01:23.200> respectively<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:28.780> now<00:01:29.780> having<00:01:29.990> drawn<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
end respectively so now having drawn the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.490 
end respectively so now having drawn the
plan<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.400> need<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.640> elevate<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.900> show

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
plan and now need to elevate it to show

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.980 
plan and now need to elevate it to show
the<00:01:33.680> height<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.820> from<00:01:35.000> each<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.479> corners

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the height so from each of the corners

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:50.210 
the height so from each of the corners
I'm<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.530> draw<00:01:36.800> a<00:01:37.899> projection<00:01:38.899> line

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.470 

and<00:01:51.150> as<00:01:51.270> long<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.480> I<00:01:51.690> can<00:01:51.890> identify<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:54.180> height

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
and as long as I can identify the height

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.250 
and as long as I can identify the height
of<00:01:54.780> each<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.050> these<00:01:55.290> points<00:01:56.390> from<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.690> base<00:01:57.870> or

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
of each of these points from the base or

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.230 
of each of these points from the base or
the<00:01:58.560> plan<00:01:59.220> then<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.940> can<00:02:00.150> draw<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.720> pictorially

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
the plan then I can draw it pictorially

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.920 
the plan then I can draw it pictorially
to<00:02:03.240> simulate<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.170> height<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> point<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.750> X

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to simulate the height so the point at X

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.910 
to simulate the height so the point at X
is<00:02:07.110> only<00:02:07.850> 10<00:02:08.850> millimeters<00:02:09.390> high<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> no<00:02:10.740> need

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is only 10 millimeters high so I no need

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.560 
is only 10 millimeters high so I no need
to<00:02:11.070> draw<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:12.660> length<00:02:13.410> at<00:02:14.270> 1<00:02:15.270> centimeter

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
to draw that length at 1 centimeter

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.230 
to draw that length at 1 centimeter
that's<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.710> same<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.910> height

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
that's the same for this one the height

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.690 
that's the same for this one the height
for<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.650> back<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.360> 30<00:02:24.360> millimeters<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
for the the back is 30 millimeters so

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.740 
for the the back is 30 millimeters so
that's<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.570> vertical<00:02:28.200> line<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.750> that

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that's that vertical line and that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.740 
that's that vertical line and that
vertical<00:02:31.350> line<00:02:32.960> as<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.050> flat<00:02:34.350> shoulder<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:35.250> so

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
vertical line as a flat shoulder here so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.930 
vertical line as a flat shoulder here so
this<00:02:36.750> point<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.320> 3<00:02:37.830> centimeters<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.880> that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
this point is 3 centimeters and that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.590 
this point is 3 centimeters and that
point<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.390> 4<00:02:39.720> centimeters<00:02:40.470> respectively<00:02:41.600> so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
point is 4 centimeters respectively so

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.890 
point is 4 centimeters respectively so
that's<00:02:42.810> three<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.470> four<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.650> then<00:02:46.650> three<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
that's three and four and then three and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.720 
that's three and four and then three and
four<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:51.240> last<00:02:51.480> point<00:02:51.690> start<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> slope

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
four and the last point start the slope

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.510 
four and the last point start the slope
for<00:02:53.730> 70<00:02:54.120> meters<00:02:55.670> from<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.880> base<00:02:57.920> ground<00:02:58.920> level

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.040 

now<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.850> bit<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.239> giant<00:03:03.630> join

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
now it's a little bit like a giant join

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.110 
now it's a little bit like a giant join
the<00:03:04.170> dots<00:03:04.350> now<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.690> know<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:08.900> that's<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the dots now I know that that's the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.600 
the dots now I know that that's the
corner<00:03:12.120> representing<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> back<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.739> that

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
corner representing the back and that

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.120 
corner representing the back and that
slopes<00:03:15.410> down<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.980> way<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:18.170> know<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.530> this

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
slopes down this way I know that this

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.850 
slopes down this way I know that this
little<00:03:20.400> line<00:03:21.800> is<00:03:22.800> one<00:03:23.610> centimeter<00:03:24.150> there<00:03:24.860> but

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
little line is one centimeter there but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.830 
little line is one centimeter there but
I<00:03:25.920> won't<00:03:26.100> actually<00:03:26.280> see<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.269> because

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
I won't actually see it here because

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.300 
I won't actually see it here because
it's<00:03:28.110> obscured<00:03:28.620> from<00:03:28.920> vision<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:31.739> point<00:03:32.100> on

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it's obscured from vision this point on

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.949 
it's obscured from vision this point on
this<00:03:32.519> point<00:03:33.890> are<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:36.470> here<00:03:38.810> which<00:03:39.810> is

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
this point are here and here which is

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.119 
this point are here and here which is
the<00:03:40.050> start<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.560> slope

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:58.399 

and<00:03:47.129> slope<00:03:47.750> comes<00:03:48.750> down<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:56.870> now<00:03:57.870> want<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.109> line

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
and slope comes down I now want to line

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.379 
and slope comes down I now want to line
the<00:03:58.590> whole<00:03:58.799> thing<00:03:59.099> in<00:04:00.920> I'm<00:04:01.920> going<00:04:02.189> to<00:04:02.459> quickly

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
the whole thing in I'm going to quickly

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:15.410 
the whole thing in I'm going to quickly
do<00:04:04.040> 45<00:04:05.040> degree<00:04:05.430> lines<00:04:05.730> go<00:04:06.659> up<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.170> left

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.140 

I<00:04:16.130> can<00:04:17.130> now<00:04:17.280> do<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.870> 45<00:04:18.870> degree<00:04:19.169> lines<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.560> go

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
I can now do the 45 degree lines that go

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:41.980 
I can now do the 45 degree lines that go
up<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.540> right<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:32.820> do<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.090> vertical<00:04:33.330> lines

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.330 

and<00:04:42.680> finally<00:04:44.440> two<00:04:45.440> lines<00:04:45.650> represent<00:04:46.250> the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
and finally two lines represent the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:57.820 
and finally two lines represent the
slope<00:04:46.550> surface<00:04:54.310> remember<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.340> rotated<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
slope surface remember I rotated the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.650 
slope surface remember I rotated the
object<00:04:58.310> through<00:04:58.430> 45<00:04:59.150> degrees<00:05:01.300> but<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.449> could

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
object through 45 degrees but that could

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.150 
object through 45 degrees but that could
have<00:05:02.750> been<00:05:02.780> 30<00:05:03.319> degrees<00:05:03.740> which<00:05:03.949> would<00:05:04.069> have

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
have been 30 degrees which would have

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.950 
have been 30 degrees which would have
left<00:05:04.310> 60<00:05:04.819> degrees<00:05:05.090> on<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.300> other<00:05:05.449> side<00:05:05.630> and
