00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.470
 which is called spikelet this bracelet 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.329
 and now you see on your screen and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.509
 four options I already wove for myself 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.550
 they all look very nice to me this 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.069
 bracelet like crazy think you he 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.140
 sure to like it too can take 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.279
 myself the same colors as I lied and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.169
 for these bracelets 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.600
 and you can come up with some of their own 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.540
 so let's see what 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.270
 we will need for this bracelet and how 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.770
 it glitters in the first place of course 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.350
 we need a machine 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.290
 we have already removed one of the rows since 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.930
 without a floor and only two or rather two 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.430
 front posts 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.060
 the machine we have to ourselves with these 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.190
 your glasses poles will also need 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.670
 hooks 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.210
 rezinochki two colors I take lemon and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.239
 pink and purple like that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.190
 interesting and also at the end weaving you 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 need lasts clasp with 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.760
 which we will connect the bracelet 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.670
 now tell you about the color of this 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.659
 for example bracelet used 7 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.479
 rezinochki pink in the middle I'll be 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.990
 as these extreme chains 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.630
 use lemon and rezinochki 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.510
 the middle here is this where is the pink y 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.360
 I will be pink and purple rezinochki 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.979
 let's see what happens and so 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.110
 let's get started first we take 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.650
 lemon rubber and dress it up 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.240
 column on the left we twist and 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.350
 we put on pro 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.039
 here is the initial eight 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.310
 was formed and now I take rezinochku 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.320
 which color I have 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.920
 pink and purple 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.090
 I put on the right column 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.579
 twist like this so that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.369
 It turned out like a eight and put on 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.810
 second turn on the bar 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:14.180
 I move and put on a lemon gum 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 on top in the usual way 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.670
 now with the help of hooks I start it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:27.170
 under the pink-purple rezinochki under all 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.269
 two turns I pull on like this 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.010
 lower lemon elastic and holding 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:39.650
 these two throw in the center now again 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 I take the pink purple rubber but 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.980
 now the sofa left column 1 turn 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.720
 twisting and second revolution 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.220
 I omit a little and on top of us 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:59.170
 worn lemon rezinochka ordinary 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.540
 In a way I reintroduce hooks under 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.799
 pink and purple two turns and all that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.609
 is below 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:14.000
 I hook the hook and take off to the center 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:16.609
 drop a little and take pink again 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.510
 rezinochku purple back to 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.850
 right column is also a wonder to them two 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.730
 turnover 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.769
 top worn in the usual way 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.190
 Lemon rubber we get hooks under 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:38.209
 just put on two rezinochki revolutions 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:43.989
 and all that we have below these two turns 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:49.310
 we hook and drop to the center 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.290
 move it all down a little bit and again I 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.260
 I think you have noticed that we have 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.049
 the same combination is repeated 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.000
 pay attention to her again and 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.450
 remember 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.099
 go to the left column put on 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.469
 gave birth to purple elastic in two 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.569
 turnover 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.659
 on top we put a lemon gum 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.760
 in the usual way 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.370
 we enter the hook under the two just worn 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.930
 turnover 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.190
 pink purple rezinochek and all that u 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:26.270
 we are lower than these turnovers in 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.080
 center and again let's repeat for 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.560
 we take pink purple 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.180
 rubber strap on the right column 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.180
 put on two turns on top put on 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.150
 in the usual way lemon rubbers 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:49.550
 we enter hooks just put on 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.550
 two turns we pull them down and we catch everything 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:57.229
 below these two turns and dump the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.449
 in the center, I think you already understand how to weave 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.849
 bracelet and then you can sit without me 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.500
 I will do it behind the scenes and then show 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.159
 how to finish this branch correctly 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.120
 this 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:10.099
 and here is such a beautiful and original 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.320
 I got a pretty bracelet 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:16.590
 spikelet 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.900
 on the posts we have rezinochki and 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.810
 to finish we take one more 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.730
 lemon gum 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.850
 put it in the usual way on both 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.000
 column and now all rezinochki which 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:36.420
 we stayed on the posts with 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.940
 1 and 2 columns we throw in the middle and 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:47.820
 one of the rezinochek throws on the other 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:52.750
 pull it from the little bit and put it on 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:55.090
 clip on these two last 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.890
 rezinochki installation we remove us 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.350
 no longer need, and a second 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.620
 clasp our 2 hooks we cling to 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:11.680
 starting rezinochku which is a chore to 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:16.050
 on the finger and our bracelet spikelet ready 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.470
