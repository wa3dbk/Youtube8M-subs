we're<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.450> together<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> hair

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
we're just going together to put a hair

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.710 
we're just going together to put a hair
in<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.710> ponytail<00:01:32.100> keeping<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> relatively

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
in a ponytail keeping it relatively

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.680 
in a ponytail keeping it relatively
smooth<00:01:34.190> into<00:01:35.190> just<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> center<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.510> head

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
smooth into just the center of the head

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.930 
smooth into just the center of the head
it's<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.290> important<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.520> dead

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
it's really important that it's dead

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.870 
it's really important that it's dead
tight<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:40.020> creates<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.680> slight<00:01:41.190> lift<00:01:41.520> just

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
tight which creates a slight lift just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.750 
tight which creates a slight lift just
here<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.740> slightly<00:01:44.130> higher<00:01:44.520> when

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
here so if we go slightly higher when

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.670 
here so if we go slightly higher when
putting<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> ponytail<00:01:45.450> it'll<00:01:46.440> create

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
putting in the ponytail it'll create

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.000 
putting in the ponytail it'll create
justice<00:01:47.220> lifts<00:01:48.080> i'm<00:01:49.080> test<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.620> once<00:01:49.830> that's

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
justice lifts i'm test it so once that's
