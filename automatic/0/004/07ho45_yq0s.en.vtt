hi<00:00:00.960> there<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.319> thought<00:00:02.220> I'd<00:00:02.340> do<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:03.080> um

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
hi there I thought I'd do a video um

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.650 
hi there I thought I'd do a video um
showing<00:00:06.390> how<00:00:07.130> stacking<00:00:08.130> pedals<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.790> get<00:00:09.480> you

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
showing how stacking pedals can get you

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.020 
showing how stacking pedals can get you
a<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:11.719> tone<00:00:12.719> or<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> sound<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:13.620> better<00:00:14.030> than

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
a a tone or a sound that's better than

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.670 
a a tone or a sound that's better than
the<00:00:15.150> sound<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> pedals<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.960> their<00:00:16.109> own<00:00:18.680> one

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the sound of the pedals on their own one

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.380 
the sound of the pedals on their own one
thing<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.760> people<00:00:20.939> do<00:00:21.060> over<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
thing I see a lot of people do over the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.599 
thing I see a lot of people do over the
years<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.810> probably<00:00:21.930> did<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.230> myself<00:00:22.609> is

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
years and I probably did it myself is

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.120 
years and I probably did it myself is
they<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.630> pedal<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.740> their<00:00:25.859> crunch

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
they have one pedal for their crunch

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.320 
they have one pedal for their crunch
sound<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.460> then<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.640> turn<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
sound and then they turn that off and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.519 
sound and then they turn that off and
then<00:00:27.420> they<00:00:27.510> turn<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.810> other<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.260> that's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
then they turn this other one on that's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.410 
then they turn this other one on that's
their<00:00:28.710> their<00:00:29.519> lead<00:00:29.730> sound<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.119> their<00:00:30.210> heavy

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
their their lead sound or their heavy

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
their their lead sound or their heavy
sound<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.830> stomp<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> back

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
sound and there you know stomp it back

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
sound and there you know stomp it back
and<00:00:32.550> forth<00:00:32.870> whereas<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.170> more<00:00:34.350> natural

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and forth whereas I think a more natural

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.549 
and forth whereas I think a more natural
way<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.890> set<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.989> your

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
way to set it up is to have your your

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.860 
way to set it up is to have your your
clean<00:00:38.100> sound<00:00:38.510> ruined<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
clean sound ruined through that and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.680 
clean sound ruined through that and
second<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.649> clean<00:00:40.890> sound<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.910> add<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.420> for

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
second your clean sound you add this for

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.350 
second your clean sound you add this for
your<00:00:42.780> crunch<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> add<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:44.360> for

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
your crunch and then you add this for

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
your crunch and then you add this for
your<00:00:45.480> heavy<00:00:46.260> sound<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.280> stacking<00:00:47.640> gain

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
your heavy sound so you're stacking gain

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.869 
your heavy sound so you're stacking gain
on<00:00:49.079> top<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.530> each<00:00:49.620> other<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:52.520> I'll<00:00:53.520> show<00:00:53.699> let's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
on top of each other so I'll show let's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
on top of each other so I'll show let's
put<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.660> clean<00:00:54.870> sound<00:00:55.110> okay

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
put this on this is my clean sound okay

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.460 
put this on this is my clean sound okay
so<00:01:00.710> I'm<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.890> treating<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.489> amp<00:01:03.470> so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so I'm just treating this as an amp so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.899 
so I'm just treating this as an amp so
you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> settings<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:07.790> I'll<00:01:08.790> be

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you can see the settings so I'll be

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.260 
you can see the settings so I'll be
fairly<00:01:09.210> normal<00:01:09.540> clean<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.930> sound<00:01:13.280> okay<00:01:14.280> so

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.840 

there's<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.360> clean<00:01:18.600> sound<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.229> wanna<00:01:19.850> know

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
there's my clean sound so I wanna know

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
there's my clean sound so I wanna know
make<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.600> crunch<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:22.200> crunch<00:01:22.439> sound<00:01:22.650> gone

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
make get my crunch my crunch sound gone

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.050 
make get my crunch my crunch sound gone
so<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.100> gonna<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> tube<00:01:23.670> screamer<00:01:23.939> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
so I'm gonna use a tube screamer for

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.720 
so I'm gonna use a tube screamer for
this

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:39.580 

the<00:01:28.730> gain<00:01:28.940> off<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.360> it<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:39.020> now<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.170> have<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.410> clean

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
the gain off of it so now I have a clean

00:01:39.590 --> 00:02:04.219 
the gain off of it so now I have a clean
sound

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.590 

now<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.640> great<00:02:06.819> crunch<00:02:07.119> silent<00:02:07.420> for<00:02:07.539> me

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
now that's a great crunch silent for me

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600 
now that's a great crunch silent for me
but<00:02:07.780> something<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.830> tube<00:02:09.009> screamer<00:02:09.340> it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
but something like a tube screamer it

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.759 
but something like a tube screamer it
doesn't<00:02:09.849> have<00:02:09.940> enough<00:02:09.970> gain<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:11.140> be<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> heavy

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
doesn't have enough gain to be a heavy

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.570 
doesn't have enough gain to be a heavy
distortion<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:14.140> know<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.440> hard<00:02:14.709> rocker<00:02:15.010> or

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
distortion you know for hard rocker or

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.070 
distortion you know for hard rocker or
even<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.209> metal<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.510> anything<00:02:16.629> like<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.810> so

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
even for metal or anything like that so

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.170 
even for metal or anything like that so
um<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.950> rather<00:02:21.160> than<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.400> maxing<00:02:22.150> out

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
um you know rather than just maxing out

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.640 
um you know rather than just maxing out
the<00:02:22.330> drive<00:02:22.510> here<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.810> losing<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.230> nice

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
crunch sound what I like to do is to

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.000 
crunch sound what I like to do is to
take<00:02:27.970> another<00:02:28.209> pedal<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.110> does<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
take another pedal and this does it the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.780 
take another pedal and this does it the
boss<00:02:30.160> ds-1<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:32.220> doesn't<00:02:33.220> sound<00:02:33.400> good<00:02:33.519> on<00:02:33.580> its

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790

that's<00:02:34.569> my<00:02:35.170> personal<00:02:35.860> opinion<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.280> don't<00:02:36.489> think

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
that's my personal opinion I don't think

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.100 
that's my personal opinion I don't think

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it sounds good on its own it maybe with

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
it sounds good on its own it maybe with
certain<00:02:38.410> amps<00:02:38.769> with<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.610> right<00:02:39.760> settings<00:02:39.970> I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
certain amps with the right settings I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.809 
certain amps with the right settings I
can<00:02:40.209> do<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.629> as<00:02:40.950> well<00:02:41.950> another<00:02:42.310> 12<00:02:42.610> o'clock

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
can do but as well another 12 o'clock

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.050 
can do but as well another 12 o'clock
here's<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.150> sounds<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:47.489> it's<00:02:48.489> fizzy<00:02:48.970> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
here's it sounds like it's fizzy and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.759 
here's it sounds like it's fizzy and
there's<00:02:52.060> no<00:02:52.180> nice<00:02:52.360> mids<00:02:52.660> there<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.140> mean<00:02:53.560> we<00:02:53.650> can

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
there's no nice mids there I mean we can

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.979 
there's no nice mids there I mean we can
mess<00:02:53.920> around<00:02:53.950> with<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> tone<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.519> bit<00:02:54.989> tone

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
mess around with the tone a bit tone

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:06.260 
mess around with the tone a bit tone
back<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.829> quieter<00:02:57.489> than<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.700> clean

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.970 

but<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.570> think<00:03:07.810> that's<00:03:07.930> hard<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.500> be<00:03:08.590> honest<00:03:08.830> and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
but I think that's hard to be honest and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.430 
but I think that's hard to be honest and
I<00:03:09.700> wouldn't<00:03:10.480> merely<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.690> wouldn't<00:03:11.050> use<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.380> I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
I wouldn't merely I wouldn't use that I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.380 
I wouldn't merely I wouldn't use that I
can<00:03:11.740> only<00:03:11.860> imagine<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.250> loud<00:03:12.640> gay<00:03:13.000> volumes

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
can only imagine that loud gay volumes

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.280 
can only imagine that loud gay volumes
that<00:03:13.510> would<00:03:13.600> get<00:03:13.810> worse

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
that would get worse

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.920 
that would get worse
the<00:03:15.250> fizziness<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.090> Moshe<00:03:16.300> low-end

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
the fizziness and the Moshe low-end

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.960 
the fizziness and the Moshe low-end
would<00:03:17.110> just<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.530> more<00:03:18.160> apparent<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:21.790> we

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
would just be more apparent but if we

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.480 
would just be more apparent but if we
run<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:22.540> pedal<00:03:22.960> into<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.440> pedal<00:03:23.770> we<00:03:24.250> keep

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
run this pedal into this pedal we keep

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.800 
run this pedal into this pedal we keep
the<00:03:24.640> overall<00:03:24.910> character<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.630> tube

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
the overall character of the tube

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.390 
the overall character of the tube
screamer<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.260> keep<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.530> nice<00:03:26.740> crunchy<00:03:27.190> mids

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
screamer we keep that nice crunchy mids

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.690 
screamer we keep that nice crunchy mids
the<00:03:28.270> definition<00:03:28.870> or<00:03:29.680> adding<00:03:30.160> another<00:03:30.370> gain

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
the definition or adding another gain

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.300 
the definition or adding another gain
stage<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> signal<00:03:32.140> here<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:33.190> our

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
stage to the signal here so got our

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.340 
stage to the signal here so got our
clean<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.330> we<00:03:34.420> add<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.690> our<00:03:34.780> crunch<00:03:35.080> and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
clean and then we add in our crunch and

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.970 
clean and then we add in our crunch and
then<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.740> add<00:03:35.860> in<00:03:36.010> our<00:03:36.330> distortion<00:03:37.330> so<00:03:37.950> back<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
then we add in our distortion so back to

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.100 
then we add in our distortion so back to
the<00:03:39.130> clean<00:03:39.310> sound

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:58.949 

and<00:03:46.740> then<00:03:47.130> out<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.310> this

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.770 

that's<00:03:59.959> me<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.349> sounds<00:04:00.650> better<00:04:01.480> run<00:04:02.480> through

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
that's me that sounds better run through

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.119 
that's me that sounds better run through
the<00:04:02.900> tube<00:04:03.170> screamer<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.709> does<00:04:03.859> on<00:04:04.010> its

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
the tube screamer then it does on its

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:16.449 
the tube screamer then it does on its
own<00:04:04.249> box<00:04:04.849> on<00:04:05.030> its<00:04:05.180> own<00:04:07.299> very<00:04:08.299> muddy<00:04:08.659> and<00:04:08.749> mushy

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.729 

whereas<00:04:17.329> when<00:04:17.449> it's<00:04:17.570> stacked<00:04:18.229> with<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.500> tube

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
whereas when it's stacked with the tube

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.439 
whereas when it's stacked with the tube
screamer<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.789> it<00:04:20.660> adds<00:04:20.870> its<00:04:21.169> own<00:04:21.669> character<00:04:22.669> to

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
screamer it it adds its own character to

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.110 
screamer it it adds its own character to
the<00:04:23.600> kind<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.870> under<00:04:24.770> under<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.190> sound<00:04:25.400> you

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
the kind of under under the sound you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.939 
the kind of under under the sound you
know<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.389> got<00:04:26.509> some<00:04:26.539> more<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.020> fat<00:04:27.350> low<00:04:27.740> end

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
know it's got some more the fat low end

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.129 
know it's got some more the fat low end
and<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.250> bit<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.669> fizzy<00:04:29.030> top<00:04:29.300> end<00:04:29.539> which<00:04:30.020> is

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
and a bit of that fizzy top end which is

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.710 
and a bit of that fizzy top end which is
good<00:04:30.289> to<00:04:30.380> cut<00:04:30.530> through<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:31.970> keep<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.389> the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
good to cut through but you keep the the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.300 
good to cut through but you keep the the
overall<00:04:33.169> character<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.889> trim<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.190> just

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
overall character of the to trim it just

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.890 
overall character of the to trim it just
sounds<00:04:34.460> like<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.580> tube<00:04:34.850> screamer<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.479> more

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
sounds like the tube screamer but more

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.879 
sounds like the tube screamer but more
more<00:04:36.320> gain<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.889> bit<00:04:37.610> more<00:04:37.789> low<00:04:37.970> end<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:39.350> like<00:04:39.620> I

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
more gain a bit more low end so like I

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.340 
more gain a bit more low end so like I
was<00:04:40.520> setting<00:04:40.789> up<00:04:40.850> my<00:04:41.000> my<00:04:41.630> clean<00:04:41.930> crunching

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
was setting up my my clean crunching

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.379 
was setting up my my clean crunching
lead<00:04:42.979> sounds<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.460> know<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.580> could<00:04:43.789> don't<00:04:44.210> do

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
lead sounds you know I could don't do

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.939 
lead sounds you know I could don't do
that<00:04:44.600> way<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.750> would<00:04:44.930> have<00:04:45.050> my<00:04:45.289> clean<00:04:46.150> my<00:04:47.150> crunch

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
that way I would have my clean my crunch

00:04:47.949 --> 00:05:10.480 
that way I would have my clean my crunch
and<00:04:48.949> then<00:04:49.220> this<00:04:49.400> from

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.879 

so<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.810> point<00:05:13.020> I'm<00:05:13.110> trying<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.290> get<00:05:13.470> across<00:05:13.560> is

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
so the point I'm trying to get across is

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.860 
so the point I'm trying to get across is
this<00:05:14.250> pedal<00:05:14.550> on<00:05:14.610> its<00:05:14.729> own<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:15.120> think<00:05:15.600> sounds

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
this pedal on its own I think sounds

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.250 
this pedal on its own I think sounds
awful<00:05:16.260> but<00:05:17.150> when<00:05:18.150> used<00:05:18.449> in<00:05:18.750> conjunction<00:05:18.930> with

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
awful but when used in conjunction with

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.710 
awful but when used in conjunction with
another<00:05:19.560> pedal<00:05:20.210> it's<00:05:21.210> all<00:05:21.389> of<00:05:21.449> a<00:05:21.510> sudden

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
another pedal it's all of a sudden

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.700 
another pedal it's all of a sudden
become<00:05:21.960> useful<00:05:22.380> again<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:24.350> you<00:05:25.350> might<00:05:25.530> have<00:05:25.680> a

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
become useful again so you might have a

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.890 
become useful again so you might have a
pedal<00:05:25.979> at<00:05:26.100> home<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.580> don't<00:05:26.760> use<00:05:26.970> or<00:05:27.360> you

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
pedal at home that you don't use or you

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.120 
pedal at home that you don't use or you
know<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.080> didn't<00:05:28.260> like<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.470> sound<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.919> or

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
know you didn't like the sound of it or

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.740 
know you didn't like the sound of it or
it's<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:29.820> like<00:05:29.970> certain<00:05:30.240> things<00:05:30.270> about<00:05:30.630> it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
it's you like certain things about it

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.090 
it's you like certain things about it
but<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:30.960> doesn't<00:05:31.199> quite<00:05:31.350> do<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.650> for<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:32.070> so

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
but it doesn't quite do it for you so

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.810 
but it doesn't quite do it for you so
you<00:05:32.250> don't<00:05:32.400> use<00:05:32.550> it

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
you don't use it

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.930 
you don't use it
well<00:05:33.389> maybe<00:05:33.570> dust<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.350> off<00:05:34.530> try<00:05:35.460> stacking<00:05:35.880> it

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
well maybe dust it off try stacking it

the overall sound of this one put this
second<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.830> run<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.220> tube<00:05:53.370> screamer<00:05:53.460> into

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
second and run the tube screamer into

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.029 
second and run the tube screamer into
that<00:05:54.020> stack<00:05:55.020> your<00:05:55.199> gain<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.380> different<00:05:55.800> way<00:05:55.860> and

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039
