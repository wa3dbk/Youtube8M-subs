 Bad idea to know which one I'm going to tell 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.250
 he thought so if I stretch 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.260
 enough when you have a 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.450
 forest with very tall trees 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.570
 I can explain and hold the tree. 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.460
 bison escape the event to me the wind 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.290
 he still died but he did not 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.630
 still managed because the wind played well 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.210
 high but he could not escape the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.860
 done it was tried and leaders of Cuba 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:06:00.030
 he almost did not give it arrived the 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.470
 way now it did not 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.700
 as already had the body teams of 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:09.000
 cosmetic this as a kaduna foot 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.070
 and steal a car on a tree as well 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.550
 Fulfilled I think it's going to be the calypso. 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.370
 of insecure my heroine canito 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.680
 wind sound and he stayed 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.900
 he finally escaped the event and 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.300
 descended from the tree and reached below 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.460
 renan but he got all stretched like that 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.500
 for example, that's all I had 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.670
 stretched he never shrunk it with 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:40.740
 this card and that's how the mouse 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:44.280
 turned into a kangaroo and nicolau time 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:47.760
 complete is this story really true 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.190

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.110
 I really do not know, but they told me the 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.310
 ethnicities that I'm counting on the piece 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:03.780
 but then lost the urge to play 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:06.090
 to play in a world lives with a wall 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.620
 rolled kangaroo handle 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:13.139
