tried them together there yet but i'm

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.430 
tried them together there yet but i'm
going<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.430> i<00:03:51.460> just<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.600> many<00:03:52.870> eyeshadows

going to i just have so many eyeshadows

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.760 
going to i just have so many eyeshadows
to<00:03:53.560> try<00:03:53.770> out<00:03:53.980> right<00:03:54.220> now<00:03:54.960> but<00:03:55.960> this<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.470> i

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
to try out right now but this I i

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.070 
to try out right now but this I i
swatched<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.640> my<00:03:57.760> hand<00:03:57.970> before<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.930> is

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
swatched it on my hand before and it is

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.710 
swatched it on my hand before and it is
so<00:03:59.740> difficult<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.580> get<00:04:00.760> off<00:04:00.910> like<00:04:01.210> obviously

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
so difficult to get off like obviously

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.450 
so difficult to get off like obviously
you<00:04:01.840> can<00:04:02.020> get<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.290> off<00:04:02.410> with<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:02.860> like

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
you can get it off with a you like

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.030 
you can get it off with a you like
waterproof<00:04:04.030> makeup<00:04:04.180> remember<00:04:04.750> or<00:04:04.930> with<00:04:05.170> I'm

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
waterproof makeup remember or with I'm

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.650 
waterproof makeup remember or with I'm
guessing<00:04:06.460> a<00:04:06.490> regular<00:04:06.850> makeup<00:04:07.060> remover<00:04:07.510> but

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
guessing a regular makeup remover but

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.630 
guessing a regular makeup remover but
you<00:04:07.780> really<00:04:07.990> have<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.440> rub<00:04:08.710> it<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:09.250> get<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.520> off

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
you really have to rub it to get it off

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.090 
you really have to rub it to get it off
so<00:04:10.180> i'm<00:04:10.450> guessing<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.050> same<00:04:11.410> power<00:04:11.740> when<00:04:11.980> it's

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
so i'm guessing the same power when it's

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.860 
so i'm guessing the same power when it's
actually<00:04:12.550> on<00:04:12.700> your<00:04:12.880> eyes<00:04:13.120> going<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.510> be<00:04:13.570> great

actually on your eyes going to be great

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.840 
actually on your eyes going to be great

price<00:04:16.120> is<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.630> they<00:04:16.780> are<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.320> cheap<00:04:17.859> um<00:04:18.250> I

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
price is that they are so cheap um I

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.190 
price is that they are so cheap um I
believe<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:19.690> they<00:04:19.810> were

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
believe that they were

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.890 
believe that they were
approximately<00:04:22.190> three<00:04:22.430> pounds<00:04:22.850> each<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.690> that

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
approximately three pounds each and that

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.560 
approximately three pounds each and that
is<00:04:24.020> very<00:04:24.050> cheap<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.360> prize

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
is very cheap as it is and that prize

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.300 
is very cheap as it is and that prize
included<00:04:27.080> value-added<00:04:27.620> tax<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.070> i<00:04:28.130> don't

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
included value-added tax and i don't

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.100 
included value-added tax and i don't
think<00:04:28.490> i<00:04:28.610> had<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.940> pay<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.180> because<00:04:29.720> i<00:04:29.900> don't

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
think i had to pay that because i don't

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.860 
think i had to pay that because i don't
live<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.440> UK<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.390> because<00:04:32.390> when<00:04:32.690> I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
live in the UK and because when I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.520 
live in the UK and because when I
actually<00:04:33.080> saw<00:04:33.380> my<00:04:33.800> like<00:04:34.220> my<00:04:34.400> received<00:04:34.910> I
