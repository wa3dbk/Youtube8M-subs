 cotoletta thousandth ear 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.210
 elephant 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.210
 I'll beat the meat and be very thin 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 I'm going to break my eggs in a pot and I'm going 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.070
 stir with fork until a compound 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.070
 twin 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.710
 I put on the rather large plate 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.640
 the grater two loaves in centuries to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.640
 make my flour 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.770
 into a sieve to 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.770
 remove larger pieces 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.560
 haha ha 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.580
 I put on a career that I left very fine. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.580
 not my style 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.770
 the sauce on both sides 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.619
 and pass in the flour 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.080
 put back into the scrambled egg 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.450
 and put again in the flour of thread 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 to make the second hard stop 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.350
 in a large frying pan 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.160
 I put a lot of butter and it 's quite 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.140
 olive oil to fry kakÃ¡ let it heat 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.140
 well and puts the athlete 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.150
 the original recipe uses only butter 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.070
 I usually use the butter unit and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.070
 olive oil extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.000
 the flesh is to accept the other side 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.910
 when I will have a very golden color and will 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 to be crispy or to remove is to put a 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.810
 paper for frying and drying the fat well 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 in excess of the true Milanese collection 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.900
 is ready 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.990
 put the salt only at the time of eating 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:03:01.360
 to leave the frying very crispy 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:03:03.710
 our rain line has two tips 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.140
 important to tell you 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.360
 The first is people do not put in salt in the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.700
 meat because otherwise it will just play 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.340
 water is that little bun of bread goes 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.110
 school and stay loose right is so bad 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.630
 another thing is who prepares here with 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.480
 Calf in Brazil is very expensive 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.209
 you can also prepare with 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.670
 the focus guy or simply chicken 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.130
 is not true but it is also 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.590
 very hot then here in the toad who 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.860
 you will discover all the truths 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.900
 all the gastronomic mysteries of the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.959
 kitchen and especially in the kitchen has 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.250

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.600
