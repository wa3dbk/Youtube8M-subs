00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 pay now with it entails 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.799
 in this way time yes yes 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.799
 There is a little bit of things but we lacked a bit of 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.779
 a puma aggressiveness when attacking 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.019
 shone inside the court 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.789
 I think it's a very close game 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.069
 in which 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.609
 the missionary he 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 the key moment in that same time 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.960
 and much to the advantage 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.470
 in the second one also 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.540
 these roles were paid this is a good date for the South American 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.359
 unfortunately no lack of experience was very disputed 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.000
 mestre 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.140
 I think that there 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.840
 the abuse of arbitration 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.430
 I think Mexico still does not not weigh that type percent tournaments 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.960
 to our way of seeing a little bit 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.540
 the localist 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.320
 but bush we knew it was going to be like that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.480
 to the reality that they make the celestial goals not to speak 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.690
 it's a good experience for the team for many its first tournament 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.510
 international ii 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.440
 and not to mention the frustration of losing we always go 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.690
 well, there 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 I think we could have done 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.830
 a little golecito in him in the second time the per first time that we contained well 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.290
 this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.500
 the second time is opportune 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.120
 do not materialize and and there 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.890
 situations where 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.710
 Over there 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 how much application 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.150
 our and lack of arbitration criteria because it seems how it combines and 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.100
 are the goals 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 would be to think about in the league this will totally side the South American this 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.920
 I keep maintaining the first place in Mexico 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.310
 we did not know it was difficult 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.960
 a good bull 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 the horrors our Bolivian apostle 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.910
 clear that it is not expected to moderate 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 It was all very good first time i 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.750
 nothing that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.540
 it sounds very distressed 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 - the cruise 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.320
 from the beginning we have to the side clarified 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.990
 I will suck 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.530
 before finishing and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 barcelona b were imposed 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 in two inattention we 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.999
 apple was controlled match was fine 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.429
 being the heroes came to them but not too much pity but 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.879
 good as tedious not only costs us dearly so 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.309
 please 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.929
 yes yes yes now 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:29.959
 you have to take advantage 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.339
 that we are good the local tournament and good 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.849
 we have to follow good that the mantra where we are
