 the taste and look good to be going to 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.520
 put a bit of the lettuce mixture 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.500
 lettuce in a big advantage that then 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.960
 good thing you have the lettuce of 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.869
 outside you have the purple lettuces 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.729
 you have the heart of the center of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.350
 lettuces then you have the part of 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.270
 outside of a lettuce is the one that has 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.640
 more property is what gives you the most 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.710
 sun and then it's the most vitamins 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.720
 will have the center to the best have 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.790
 less vitamin concentration but 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.190
 has a type of egypt estrogen that is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.200
 yellow which is one of the most powerful 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.790
 there is one that most attacks the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.380
 free radicals we're also going to have 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 this kind of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.110
 beta carotene which is a red beta-carotene 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.579
 that this also helps fight everything 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.470
 what hurts us all that 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.390
 that intoxicate us we are talking about 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.220
 a protein source very import a 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.380
 very important fiber source also 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.659
 it contains a lot of water then also 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 we are talking about a food that is 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.329
 low in calories we're going to put a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 little bit of tomato more than attacking or you we 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:14.170
 little bit of tomato, we go to where 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.660
 we are going to put the ones that go here 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.280
 not free here like it's a volcano 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.180
 erupting 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.180
 it is a family 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.800
 no longer goyo who said he was 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.800
 asleep ha ha ha ha 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.880
 do not stain the eclipses here the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.880
 fungus I happy and woman 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.079
 and this week 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.070
 I think it hurts your head or something 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.340
 well I do not know why but I think I think 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.650
 well let's put this a little bit 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.420
 cucumber that the cucumber if they can preserve 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.860
 the shell would be wonderful for 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.230
 take a little bit that vitamin d that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.360
 has the shell the vitamin b all the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.490
 central nervous system there will be 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.880
 ok let's also put a little bit of 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.190
 jícama that you hear is a Mexican product 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.930
 It has a lot of water, do not cut it off 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.280
 that is fattening because there are many people who 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.530
 he goes on a diet and says true that he does not 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.960
 I can jícama because it has as they say 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.650
 if the starch does not but it tells me why 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.990
 has a lot of sugar this one does have starch 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.570
 it's a type of carbohydrate the 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.540
 carbohydrate between the body and as soon as 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.010
 it gets to the intestine it becomes sugar because 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.230
 because that's the metabolism of the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.270
 carbohydrates is made sugar we go to 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.790
 imagine that they are pearls not that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.470
 They reach the level of the intestine these 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.960
 pearls are going to cross the wall of the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.740
 intestine can pass through it very quickly 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.530
 Hello 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.530
 going through very slowly that's what is going to 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 determine the insulin that we are going to 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.010
 drop on the body 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.750
 this will determine the glycemic index 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.090
 of the body 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.860
 now if we put a type of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.020
 starch or a type of carbohydrate 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.750
 complexes what we are going to do is that 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.490
 those sugar pearls instead of entering 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.280
 fast to the bloodstream they 're going to go 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.770
 gradually entering al a al a la 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.840
 blood and this is going to cause our 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.970
 insulin is always stable when 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.310
 insulin levels rise that we are worth 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.780
 we grow fat or you have them there is a 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.970
 predisposition to diabetes that does not 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.830
 we want to have mushrooms rich in 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.840
 proteins that mushrooms live I 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.690
 I simply love mushrooms because 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.740
 As the pongas are rich, you do not put them 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.210
 with well with rich raw onions 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.010
 known rich in sauce but in soup 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:48.990
 is baked in here delicious in 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.830
 pizzas in nothing have a very good 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.110
 very good we are going to put a little 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.370
 panela cheese that eyes also split that 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.030
 people who think 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.000
 on the slide 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.340
 forgiveness is made with whole milk this is not 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.130
 is a cheese that is for the diet there 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.260
 other cheeses we can use the cheese 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.390
 goat cheese manchego 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.300
 well not manchego also is also 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:16.880
 made with this with the etcetera is more 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.270
 cheap the panel so what can they do 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.750
 is that you have to do, I recommend them 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.870
 that if I play you're low in fat or some 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.510
 handmade that are made a little 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.050
 and look for a craft because 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.300
 this type of product is going to 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.750
 help to be healthy and strong 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.240
 quickly the vinaigrette 121212 we are going to 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.240
 put the mustard 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.980
 let's put the lemon juice 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.610
 let's put some salt and pepper 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:58.310
 let's mix with a balloon to this 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.510
 let's add a little oil 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.080
 olive 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.450
 and with that we have already secured a 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.300
 source also of important fats of 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.480
 protein popcorn minerals 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.360
 vitamins everything and this we are going to throw to 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.600
 our salad and with that we go a 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.600
 cut 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.499
 to me
