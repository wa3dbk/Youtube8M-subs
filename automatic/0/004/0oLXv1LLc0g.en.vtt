00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.960 
the times i do i just want to see what
this<00:04:23.650> would<00:04:23.830> do<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.450> mean<00:04:25.780> honestly<00:04:26.139> I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
this would do and so I mean honestly I

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.300 
this would do and so I mean honestly I
you<00:04:27.970> know<00:04:28.139> feel<00:04:29.139> like<00:04:29.200> even<00:04:29.530> with<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.830> setting

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
you know feel like even with a setting

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.040 
you know feel like even with a setting
spray<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.300> would<00:04:31.419> probably<00:04:31.660> be<00:04:31.960> even

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
spray to like it would probably be even

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.520 
spray to like it would probably be even
even<00:04:32.770> better<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.300> do<00:04:34.510> recommend<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:35.350> if

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
even better so I do recommend this if

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.700 
even better so I do recommend this if
you<00:04:35.620> have<00:04:35.740> oily<00:04:35.889> skin<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.820> or<00:04:37.600> even<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.230> don't

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
you have oily skin and or even I don't

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.020 
you have oily skin and or even I don't
know<00:04:38.800> I'm<00:04:38.950> probably<00:04:39.100> work<00:04:39.370> for<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.580> dry<00:04:39.730> skin

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
know I'm probably work for a dry skin

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.920 
know I'm probably work for a dry skin
too<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:40.540> have<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:41.740> hard<00:04:42.190> time<00:04:42.930> keeping

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
too but you have a hard time keeping

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.870 
too but you have a hard time keeping
your<00:04:43.960> makeup<00:04:44.350> on<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:45.250> just<00:04:45.430> feels<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.669> it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
your makeup on it just feels like it

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.760 
your makeup on it just feels like it
slides<00:04:46.180> off<00:04:46.389> your<00:04:46.450> face<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.169> really<00:04:47.620> recommend

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
slides off your face I really recommend

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.440 
slides off your face I really recommend
this<00:04:48.070> at<00:04:48.430> least<00:04:48.610> like<00:04:48.880> getting<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.270> sample

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
this at least like getting a sample

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.870 
this at least like getting a sample
maybe<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.050> trying<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.470> out<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:51.520> see<00:04:51.700> if<00:04:51.730> it

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
maybe and trying it out to see if it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.659 
maybe and trying it out to see if it
works<00:04:52.090> for<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.450> um<00:04:53.250> because<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.550> so

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
works for you um because it is so

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
expensive I I don't know if I would go

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.530 
expensive I I don't know if I would go
out<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.770> like<00:04:57.130> buy<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.460> because<00:04:57.729> again<00:04:58.270> things

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
out and like buy it because again things

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.240 
out and like buy it because again things
work<00:04:58.750> differently<00:04:58.780> for<00:04:59.320> different<00:04:59.380> people<00:04:59.979> um
