can<00:01:16.900> we<00:01:17.900> go<00:01:18.080> until<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.620> next<00:01:18.860> thing<00:01:19.160> is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
can we go until the next thing is

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.060 
can we go until the next thing is
selected<00:01:20.600> which<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.930> his<00:01:21.140> next<00:01:21.350> limb<00:01:21.620> trying

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
selected which is his next limb trying

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.970 
selected which is his next limb trying
fell<00:01:22.280> down

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.440 

and<00:01:25.550> then<00:01:25.940> try<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.600> survive

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.990 

got<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.630> be<00:01:32.750> mindful<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.440> your

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 

so<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> Shatterer<00:01:40.350> level<00:01:41.070> 50<00:01:41.460> world

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so this is the Shatterer level 50 world

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.000 
so this is the Shatterer level 50 world
boss<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.300> probably<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.320> first<00:01:43.680> world

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
think resort is the glitch pliz ridge

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
think resort is the glitch pliz ridge
steps<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.450> him<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.660> try<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.460> find

steps so if you want him to try and find

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
steps so if you want him to try and find
this<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:53.940> guide<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> where<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this from guide that that is where you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
this from guide that that is where you
need<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:56.010> what<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.580> fears<00:01:56.940> what

need to go now what in this fears what
you<00:01:57.270> need<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.570> burn<00:01:57.780> these<00:01:57.960> crystals

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
you need to do is burn these crystals

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.800 
you need to do is burn these crystals
down<00:01:58.650> as<00:01:58.920> quickly<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.550> possible<00:01:59.970> because<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
down as quickly as possible because the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.380 
down as quickly as possible because the
longer<00:02:01.020> these<00:02:01.260> crystals<00:02:01.830> are<00:02:01.890> other<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:02.970> p

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
longer these crystals are other then p

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.830 
longer these crystals are other then p
or<00:02:04.020> hell<00:02:04.440> me<00:02:04.760> that<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.910> shadow<00:02:06.150> will<00:02:06.450> recover

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
or hell me that the shadow will recover

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.830 
or hell me that the shadow will recover
I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.470> that's<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.690> although<00:02:09.690> he

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
I think that's all of them although he

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
I think that's all of them although he
seemed<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.470> staring<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> ground

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
seemed to be just staring at the ground

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.840 
seemed to be just staring at the ground
now<00:02:12.180> they're<00:02:13.050> getting<00:02:13.230> closer<00:02:13.650> oh<00:02:14.070> no<00:02:14.670> they

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
hunt the crystals down he didn't manage

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.900 
hunt the crystals down he didn't manage
to<00:02:25.170> heal<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.640> did<00:02:26.880> a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
to heal very much there so we did a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.710 
to heal very much there so we did a
pretty<00:02:27.239> good<00:02:27.600> job<00:02:29.030> that's<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.239> kiss<00:02:30.480> of
