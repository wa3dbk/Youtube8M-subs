00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi guys okay with you in today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.589
 talk about the book forgive both the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.210
 fall the woman was not right and I think 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.730
 we are with you, you must know more 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 Who does not know Joe? 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.190
 she also has a box on youtube one 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.960
 organ called clarice paper and finally 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.689
 I do not know if I do not know if you know 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.330
 addition, but your channel was the first to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.480
 I saw here on youtube total in an area of 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 dictated by reading the literature blog and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.809
 falling on your blog fills posts with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:40.079
 videos and I our merger was this and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.930
 after several of yours and then 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.690
 other mann began to appear 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.180
 barry on youtube average similar 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.180
 cancel and in which I began to discover 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.530
 that a lot of people did it later 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 for a while I started doing this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.180
 but in yours was the first brigade 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 Thank you for showing me around. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.360
 this world and thank you for sending 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.610
 your book with such a beautiful dedication 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 and let's talk about the book now 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 I write a book of poetry, I do not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 I'm a very frequent reader of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.520
 poetry but I like every once in a while 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 I'll read some observations from 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.390
 The things that I noticed about her book are 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.600
 reminding you I 'm not a reader 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.570
 frequent poetry and I will not go 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.780
 be able to analyze so different from 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.210
 book nothing 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.460
 I notice in books in a lyrical voice 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.159
 no voice of the narrator of a woman 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.790
 very strong but at the same time very 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.420
 female with many doubts 20 one 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.630
 woman who has many different angles 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 and she even in different poems and can 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 have but since it is the same woman who is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.630
 writing everyone as you can think 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.479
 who are different women is the narrator 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 they are different people but I in my 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 head only one person who is very 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.579
 very complex because the case 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.160
 of the book that I think she 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.780
 lets do a lot of experiment then have 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.840
 poems of various formats 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.910
 It's just a glance at you, but I 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.220
 I think she allows herself to still find out 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.459
 play that is something I 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.290
 I think it's very cool 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.910
 so there are things that have longer things 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.980
 shorter 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.230
 there are things that seem to have a format 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.480
 more accurate while others have a 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.160
 more different format 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.100
 I find this very interesting and I think 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.280
 which also matches this issue of 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.140
 to have so many voices speaking is yours 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.060
 person with many angles speaking of 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.080
 have so many formats I think 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.780
 interesting 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 one of my favorite poems until post 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.489
 I do not think facebook and it calls new 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.890
 Indian five Brazilians both incredible 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.530
 freedom from time to time a kiss 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 without ceiling has at your fingertips all 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.080
 human sex 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.480
 I think it's cute and I like it 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.610
 I will not read it because it is already a 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.299
 poem and my ability to 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.299
 reading is very small but it is the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.140
 almost ana c which tells the story of a 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.670
 woman who prepares everything to expect a 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.030
 man but she's actually sleeping 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.930
 Alone reminded me so much was one of the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 only made and that also has a little 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.730
 this question you try to get out there 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.180
 also in the book a variety of themes 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.609
 neither can she be lighter 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.280
 and pick up smaller things one day to 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:52.989
 day in another room discuss the most themes 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.730
 serious as death loneliness and I think 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.470
 this is very interesting too 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.500
 today we prove what I think in total 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.049
 I played about three times or so 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.750
 I take some time to digest poetry 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.209
 So I saw once there I came back in what 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.209
 I liked it the most after a while 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.280
 he again and I think it's going to happen 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.320
 with many readers of law is one more 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.120
 the silva that already takes into account what 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.650
 happened to you too 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.849
 but I think it 's a book that has this 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.760
 feature 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:24.460
 good guys i hope to be shown on the video 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.910
 even judged for having sent the book and 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.910
 so far
