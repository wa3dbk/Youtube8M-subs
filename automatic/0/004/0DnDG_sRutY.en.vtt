before<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.559> get<00:00:10.740> into<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.920> video<00:00:11.219> if<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.550> look

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
before I get into this video if you look

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.190 
before I get into this video if you look
at<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.820> mini-map<00:00:12.150> imagining<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> sandy

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
at the mini-map imagining the sandy

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.959 
at the mini-map imagining the sandy
shores<00:00:13.440> area<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.280> proves<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.820> can

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
shores area so this proves that you can

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.400 
shores area so this proves that you can
get<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.269> pretty<00:00:15.570> much<00:00:15.690> anywhere<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.230> map

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
get to pretty much anywhere in the map

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
get to pretty much anywhere in the map
that<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.680> want<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.070> if<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.940> could<00:00:18.119> leave<00:00:18.240> a

you want to come to the glitz I uploaded

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.960 
you want to come to the glitz I uploaded
a<00:00:25.830> couple<00:00:26.070> days<00:00:26.250> ago<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:26.849> know

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
a couple days ago if you don't know

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.150 
a couple days ago if you don't know
where<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> mini-map<00:00:28.619> /

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
where it is here it is on the mini-map /

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.669 
where it is here it is on the mini-map /
map<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.840> location<00:00:31.260> easy

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
map so you can get to this location easy

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920 
map so you can get to this location easy
then<00:00:32.340> you're<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> need<00:00:32.910> two<00:00:33.149> people<00:00:33.390> one

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
then you're going to need two people one

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
then you're going to need two people one
driving<00:00:34.469> obviously<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> motorbike<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
driving obviously on the motorbike and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.180 
driving obviously on the motorbike and
one<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> back<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> passenger<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> then

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
one on the back as a passenger and then

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
one on the back as a passenger and then
you<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> jump<00:00:38.879> off<00:00:39.090> under<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.510> map<00:00:39.780> where

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you want to jump off under the map where

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
you want to jump off under the map where
you<00:00:40.469> go<00:00:40.620> through<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> war<00:00:41.190> platform<00:00:41.969> nine<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you go through the war platform nine and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
you go through the war platform nine and
three-quarters<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.890> pretty

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
three-quarters and then you just pretty

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
three-quarters and then you just pretty
much<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> wheelie<00:00:44.969> when<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.539> under<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
much got a wheelie when you're under the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
much got a wheelie when you're under the
map<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.980> look<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> bottom<00:00:47.789> left

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
map and if you look on the bottom left

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
map and if you look on the bottom left
where<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> mini-map<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.289> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
where the mini-map is you can see that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
where the mini-map is you can see that
you<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.950> you're<00:00:50.610> actually<00:00:50.730> like

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you actually like you're actually like

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
you actually like you're actually like
traveling<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:52.110> underneath<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.829> map<00:00:52.980> if

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
traveling like underneath the map if

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
traveling like underneath the map if
that<00:00:53.309> makes<00:00:53.550> sense<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.449> higher<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that makes sense and I'm the higher you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.260 
that makes sense and I'm the higher you
wheelie<00:00:55.320> obviously<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> faster<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.789> go<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
wheelie obviously the faster you go and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
wheelie obviously the faster you go and
if<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.109> too<00:00:58.170> high<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.010> actually

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
if you go too high then you can actually

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.500 
if you go too high then you can actually
fall<00:00:59.640> off<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> get

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
fall off so you're going to get

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
fall off so you're going to get
perspectives<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.829> driving<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.520> going

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
perspectives of me driving you're going

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
perspectives of me driving you're going
to<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> perspective<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.660> chaotic<00:01:04.559> driving

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to get a perspective of chaotic driving

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
to get a perspective of chaotic driving
and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.400> me<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.360> you're

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and then me on the back and then you're

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
and then me on the back and then you're
going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> some<00:01:06.990> other<00:01:07.140> clip<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.590> fast

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
going to get some other clip so fast

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
going to get some other clip so fast
forwarded<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
forwarded as well so you don't have to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200 
forwarded as well so you don't have to
fast-forward<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> even<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> word<00:01:11.369> well

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
fast-forward it is that even a word well

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
fast-forward it is that even a word well
I<00:01:12.240> made<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> clip<00:01:13.290> fast<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.740> sped<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> clip

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I made the clip fast I sped up the clip

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
I made the clip fast I sped up the clip
so<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.270> guys<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.229> waste

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
so you guys don't have to like waste

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
so you guys don't have to like waste
your<00:01:16.680> time<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.640> see

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your time you can just pretty much see

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
your time you can just pretty much see
what's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
what's going on and how to do it to the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
what's going on and how to do it to the
high<00:01:19.979> wheelie<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> faster<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.119> make<00:01:21.420> sure

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
high wheelie the faster you go make sure

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
high wheelie the faster you go make sure
you<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.720> two<00:01:21.930> people<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you got two people to do this and as you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.640 
you got two people to do this and as you
see<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.390> water<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.290> happens

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see if you go into water that happens
