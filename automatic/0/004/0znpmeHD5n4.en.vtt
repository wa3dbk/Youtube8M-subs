and wonder whether the issue is about

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.689 
and wonder whether the issue is about
whether<00:04:07.290> fighting<00:04:07.889> in<00:04:08.009> hockey<00:04:08.220> should<00:04:08.579> be

whether fighting in hockey should be

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
as a general moral issue these two

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.170 
as a general moral issue these two
aren't<00:04:14.009> necessarily<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.549> same<00:04:14.639> thing

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
aren't necessarily the same thing

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.689 
aren't necessarily the same thing
I<00:04:15.209> might<00:04:15.989> judge<00:04:16.199> in<00:04:16.349> action<00:04:16.739> or<00:04:16.949> a<00:04:17.009> practice<00:04:17.579> to

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
I might judge in action or a practice to

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.699 
I might judge in action or a practice to
be<00:04:17.789> morally<00:04:18.030> wrong<00:04:18.150> but<00:04:18.750> not<00:04:19.229> necessarily

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
be morally wrong but not necessarily

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.430 
be morally wrong but not necessarily
agree<00:04:20.009> that<00:04:20.159> the<00:04:20.280> practice<00:04:20.639> should<00:04:20.759> be<00:04:20.820> banned

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
agree that the practice should be banned

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.750 
agree that the practice should be banned
and<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:22.650> also<00:04:22.770> clear<00:04:23.070> whether<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.610> is

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
and it's also clear whether this is

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.219 
and it's also clear whether this is
about<00:04:23.969> professional<00:04:24.210> hockey<00:04:24.690> or<00:04:25.050> whether

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
about professional hockey or whether

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.659 
about professional hockey or whether
it's<00:04:25.409> meant<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.650> include<00:04:25.860> amateur<00:04:26.310> hawk<00:04:26.460> and

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
it's meant to include amateur hawk and

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's meant to include amateur hawk and
if<00:04:26.729> so

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
if so

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.420 
if so
age<00:04:27.630> range<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.110> players<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.710> being<00:04:28.950> considered

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
age range of players is being considered

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.070 
age range of players is being considered
so<00:04:30.120> there's<00:04:30.300> room<00:04:30.390> for<00:04:30.450> improvement<00:04:30.630> in

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
so there's room for improvement in

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.930 
so there's room for improvement in
clarifying<00:04:31.680> precisely<00:04:32.190> what<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.610> issue<00:04:32.760> is

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
clarifying precisely what the issue is

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.760 
clarifying precisely what the issue is
but<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.900> still<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.230> too<00:04:34.380> bad

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
but it's still not too bad

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.130 
but it's still not too bad
now<00:04:35.700> does<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.150> introduction<00:04:36.540> have<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> clear

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.670 
makes it clear in a couple of places
what<00:04:42.000> side<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.570> going<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.840> come<00:04:43.020> down<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.260> in

what side is going to come down on in
this<00:04:43.950> debate<00:04:44.100> but<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.030> clearest<00:04:45.360> place<00:04:45.570> is

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
this debate but the clearest place is

people<00:05:07.590> object<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.400> fighting<00:05:08.820> in<00:05:08.910> hockey

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
people object that fighting in hockey

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.670 
people object that fighting in hockey
sends<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.690> message<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.020> children<00:05:10.500> that

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
sends the message to children that

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.920 
sends the message to children that
violence<00:05:11.130> is<00:05:11.310> acceptable<00:05:11.460> but<00:05:12.420> I<00:05:12.480> will<00:05:12.690> argue

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
violence is acceptable but I will argue

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.750 
violence is acceptable but I will argue
that<00:05:13.110> fighting<00:05:13.590> actually<00:05:13.980> prevents<00:05:14.460> more

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
that fighting actually prevents more

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.210 
that fighting actually prevents more
injuries<00:05:15.300> than<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.690> causes<00:05:16.170> this<00:05:16.650> tells<00:05:17.040> us

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
injuries than it causes this tells us

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.260 
injuries than it causes this tells us
something<00:05:17.490> about<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:17.850> argumentative

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
something about the argumentative

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.480 
something about the argumentative
structure<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.900> essay<00:05:19.260> we<00:05:19.860> know<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
introduction need this kind of outlining

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.630 
introduction need this kind of outlining
for<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.080> shorter<00:05:31.350> essay<00:05:31.590> like<00:05:31.740> this<00:05:31.920> maybe<00:05:32.550> not

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
for a shorter essay like this maybe not

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.480 
for a shorter essay like this maybe not
this<00:05:33.180> is<00:05:33.360> partly<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.750> matter<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.990> preference

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
this is partly a matter of preference

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.280 
this is partly a matter of preference
but<00:05:35.490> you'll<00:05:35.640> never<00:05:35.790> go<00:05:35.940> wrong<00:05:35.970> by<00:05:36.630> adding<00:05:37.050> some

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
but you'll never go wrong by adding some

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.020 
but you'll never go wrong by adding some
discussion<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:37.950> how<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.160> argument<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.790> going

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
discussion of how the argument is going

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.230 
discussion of how the argument is going
to<00:05:39.180> proceed<00:05:39.600> it's<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.470> good<00:05:40.620> habit<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.860> pick<00:05:41.040> up

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
to proceed it's a good habit to pick up

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.370 
to proceed it's a good habit to pick up
so<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.420> introduction<00:05:42.780> gets<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.200> few

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
so this introduction gets a few

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.440 
so this introduction gets a few
important<00:05:43.740> things<00:05:43.860> right<00:05:44.090> does<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.240> do

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
important things right does it do

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.260 
important things right does it do
anything<00:05:45.900> wrong<00:05:46.280> well<00:05:47.280> if<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:47.760> were<00:05:47.910> editing

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
anything wrong well if I were editing

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.510 
anything wrong well if I were editing
this<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:48.840> recommend<00:05:49.200> that<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.710> writer<00:05:49.890> rethink

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
this I recommend that the writer rethink

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.630 
this I recommend that the writer rethink
that<00:05:50.730> second<00:05:51.210> sentence<00:05:51.950> this<00:05:52.950> sentence<00:05:53.340> tells

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
that second sentence this sentence tells

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.370 
that second sentence this sentence tells
us<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:53.910> lot<00:05:54.240> about<00:05:54.300> how<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.840> argument<00:05:55.050> of<00:05:55.320> the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
us a lot about how the argument of the

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.310 
us a lot about how the argument of the
essay<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.830> going<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.220> go<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.840> think<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:58.050> tells<00:05:58.170> us

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
essay is going to go I think it tells us

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.740 
essay is going to go I think it tells us
too<00:05:58.560> much<00:05:58.850> it's<00:05:59.850> actually<00:06:00.150> giving<00:06:00.630> an

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
too much it's actually giving an

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.600 
too much it's actually giving an
argument<00:06:01.230> for<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.560> main<00:06:01.740> conclusion<00:06:02.400> and

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
argument for the main conclusion and

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.120 
argument for the main conclusion and
that's<00:06:03.360> not<00:06:03.600> what<00:06:03.900> an<00:06:04.020> introduction<00:06:04.350> is<00:06:04.650> for

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
that's not what an introduction is for

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.580 
that's not what an introduction is for
this<00:06:05.970> belongs<00:06:06.360> in<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.660> main<00:06:06.870> body<00:06:07.290> of<00:06:07.470> the
