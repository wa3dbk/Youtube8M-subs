00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
mean if Naruto movies can do cannon to
the<00:01:21.479> manga<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.290> piece<00:01:22.470> movies<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.070> as

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the manga one piece movies can do it as

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820 
the manga one piece movies can do it as
well<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.640> film<00:01:24.150> Z<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.600> said<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
well I know film Z was said to be if it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
well I know film Z was said to be if it
were<00:01:26.070> canon<00:01:26.729> somewhere<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
were canon somewhere but it just kind of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
were canon somewhere but it just kind of
doesn't<00:01:28.020> fit<00:01:28.380> quite<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.610> think

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
doesn't fit quite right and I think

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
doesn't fit quite right and I think
strong<00:01:30.090> world<00:01:30.299> could<00:01:30.570> potentially<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.110> cannon

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
strong world could potentially be cannon

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.899 
strong world could potentially be cannon
as<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.400> hundred<00:01:32.460> percent<00:01:32.670> sure

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
as well I'm not one hundred percent sure

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030 
as well I'm not one hundred percent sure
about<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:34.290> would<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:34.829> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
about that but I would like for this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.289 
about that but I would like for this
movie<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.369> cannon<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.909> again<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.150> would

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it could be that they're making a new
