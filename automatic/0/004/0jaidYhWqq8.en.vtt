up at twilight to start hunting I would

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.539 
up at twilight to start hunting I would

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
follow them in my vehicle one night I've

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.090 
follow them in my vehicle one night I've
been<00:01:38.000> roaming<00:01:38.450> around<00:01:38.569> with<00:01:38.959> them<00:01:39.200> as<00:01:39.619> usual

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
been roaming around with them as usual

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.180 
been roaming around with them as usual
and<00:01:40.610> they<00:01:41.149> had<00:01:41.360> not<00:01:41.539> found<00:01:41.929> anything<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.830> hunt

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
and they had not found anything to hunt

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.300 
and they had not found anything to hunt
and<00:01:44.110> then<00:01:45.110> light<00:01:45.409> came<00:01:45.709> back<00:01:45.950> over<00:01:46.159> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
and then light came back over the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.940 
and then light came back over the
eastern<00:01:46.850> horizon<00:01:47.170> they<00:01:48.170> were<00:01:48.229> not<00:01:48.440> very<00:01:48.709> happy

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
eastern horizon they were not very happy

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.520 
eastern horizon they were not very happy
they<00:01:49.670> were<00:01:49.729> hungry<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.479> they<00:01:51.259> were<00:01:51.379> also

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
they were hungry and they were also

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.130 
they were hungry and they were also
thirsty<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.910> then<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:53.179> noticed<00:01:53.479> that<00:01:53.929> they

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
thirsty and then I noticed that they

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.770 
thirsty and then I noticed that they
were<00:01:54.170> turning<00:01:55.160> towards<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.819> waterhole<00:01:56.420> I

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
were turning towards a waterhole I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.510 
were turning towards a waterhole I
thought<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:57.770> might<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.129> very<00:01:58.459> good

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
thought there might be a very good

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.219 
thought there might be a very good
chance<00:01:58.910> that<00:01:59.239> they<00:01:59.360> were<00:01:59.420> going<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.810> drink

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
chance that they were going to drink

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.979 
chance that they were going to drink
before<00:02:00.440> David<00:02:00.979> go<00:02:01.129> to<00:02:01.190> sleep<00:02:01.610> again<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.629> I<00:02:02.660> went

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
before David go to sleep again so I went

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.169 
before David go to sleep again so I went
ahead<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.349> my<00:02:03.560> land<00:02:03.800> rover<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.519> then<00:02:05.149> I

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
ahead in my land rover and then I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.080 
ahead in my land rover and then I
positioned<00:02:05.840> myself<00:02:05.840> at<00:02:06.739> the<00:02:07.250> far<00:02:07.580> end<00:02:07.849> of<00:02:08.060> the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750 
this case I was working in a remote area
and<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.709> had<00:02:36.890> permissions<00:02:37.400> from<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.570

government<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.870> do<00:02:39.050> things<00:02:39.379> that<00:02:39.709> are<00:02:40.129> not

government to do things that are not

government to do things that are not
able<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.629> done<00:02:41.900> by<00:02:42.470> ordinary<00:02:43.010> tourists<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
able to be done by ordinary tourists the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.720 
able to be done by ordinary tourists the
Lions<00:02:45.230> approached<00:02:46.060> with<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> Sun<00:02:47.450> behind<00:02:47.659> me

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
Lions approached with the Sun behind me

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.759 
Lions approached with the Sun behind me
they<00:02:49.730> noticed<00:02:50.180> me<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.510> course<00:02:50.780> but<00:02:51.080> they<00:02:51.709> were

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
they noticed me of course but they were

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.520 
they noticed me of course but they were
much<00:02:52.159> thirstier<00:02:53.150> than<00:02:53.300> they<00:02:53.720> were<00:02:53.780> interested

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
much thirstier than they were interested

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.030 
much thirstier than they were interested
in<00:02:54.620> me<00:02:54.859> so<00:02:55.700> from<00:02:56.299> this<00:02:56.450> low<00:02:56.810> vantage<00:02:57.379> point<00:02:57.739> on

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
in me so from this low vantage point on

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.950 
in me so from this low vantage point on
the<00:02:58.549> perfect<00:02:59.030> lighting<00:02:59.269> condition

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
the perfect lighting condition

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.960 
the perfect lighting condition
I<00:03:00.320> was<00:03:00.770> able<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.100> make<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.370> intimate

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
I was able to make this intimate

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.420 
I was able to make this intimate
portrait<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.780> these<00:03:02.930> four<00:03:03.260> sisters<00:03:03.830> drinking

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
portrait of these four sisters drinking

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.330 
portrait of these four sisters drinking
but<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.000> find<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.570> intriguing<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.740> their

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
but I find so intriguing is that their

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.300 
but I find so intriguing is that their
tongues<00:03:07.730> are<00:03:08.180> all<00:03:08.540> lapping<00:03:08.900> at<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.380> water<00:03:09.620> but

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
tongues are all lapping at the water but

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.280 
tongues are all lapping at the water but
they're<00:03:10.490> just<00:03:10.670> slightly<00:03:11.240> out<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.570> phase<00:03:11.930> from

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
they're just slightly out of phase from

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.530 
they're just slightly out of phase from
each<00:03:12.470> other<00:03:12.710> truly<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.910> one-of-a-kind<00:03:14.810> moment
