00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.700
 10 won 7 on the illness 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.850
 body to body with the ethylene did the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.210
 port and time on the back a business 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.939
 so it is a dream that has always had two 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.220
 very great passions that are the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.790
 travel the sport asks since I am 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.320
 small already in itself shoulders from 18 years in 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.210
 then and then a kind of little trip 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.040
 conventional and I've always seen the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.540
 people turn to cycling for the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.450
 fine world said sooner or later in life 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.910
 I have to take this tour 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 paola's dream and the world tour in 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.010
 bicycle 30,000 kilometers less than 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.949
 five months ten hours a day on the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.039
 saddle touching 22 nations of the five 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.629
 continents set off with the mimosa el 8 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.749
 March was obviously not chosen to 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.760
 case already it is not a women's party 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:02.820
 a date that has been chosen for 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.939
 because it is an important date and I would like 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.960
 try to honor it best in this 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.490
 moment I would like to try to give them all 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 women 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.259
 the hope that if you have a dream like that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 great you can take home to leave 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.420
 right on the feast day of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 women 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.909
 it really means more importance 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.909
 has a project almost totally 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.710
 female one year of basic preparation 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 his ivrea home in the province of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 torino where friends and family are members 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.909
 his team and many supporters too 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.610
 telematics that can follow 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.130
 travel and daily journaling will not be 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.630
 easy dialogue is what you want 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 say hold on 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 etienne and now in sense or in a broad sense 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.530
 so for me it means hold on 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.380
 any situation when 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.179
 I will find the rain I go to face the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 different seasons different climates 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.069
 different altitudes therefore means 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.319
 Hold on, however, especially on the pedals it is 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.750
 also in a very broad sense therefore we have 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.750
 wanted to name this venture to say 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.090
 to people of my age that I have 32 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.509
 years to hold on in a moment of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.760
 crisis 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.739
 the moment we are living now and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.630
 therefore not to give up but to continue to 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.489
 carry on your dreams because you are 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.150
 a goal a dream can bring you to 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.150
 term 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.410
 grinds miles of road you wanted 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.410
 the bike 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.790
 we can say that everything comes from one 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.830
 ugly blow 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.390
 yes well as every dream is like when you are 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.640
 has a great goal always comes from 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.950
 a moment of crisis that is a society 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.540
 that I had to shut down because of 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.160
 crisis is an almost true society that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.170
 organized sporting and cultural events 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.420
 so you can't even team building 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.459
 staff training and then the end 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.560
 of 2012 due to the crisis I have 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.989
 preferred to close it and therefore I have 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.630
 dedicated to this last year 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.060
 great project will be a business full of 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.799
 personal and cultural meanings such as 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.630
 every trip but also sporting 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.190
 obviously even scientific in 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.319
 collaboration with the university la 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.940
 rome's knowledge the polytechnic of 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.069
 the medical research center in 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.200
 mountain of osta the maria psychologist 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.940
 luisa monticelli and that's not all 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.950
 will document the bikes that 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.310
 will meet the world used for 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.430
 fun or for work or for living 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.959
 finally another chose if a business 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.069
 also social by pursuing gods 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.560
 projects with school children 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.720
 elementary school that gave me some 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.850
 letters and I will take them to them 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.400
 colleagues around the world and therefore 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.370
 I will be the bike position for for 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.109
 the children 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.450
 many times I happened to want to say 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.010
 but who lets me do it, however, I give up 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.829
 as I said before when you have a dream 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.000
 you have to complete it you can say 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.569
 so much effort fatigue 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.510
 a sport is an endurance sport 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.700
 very heavy and therefore when in 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.189
 climb when trying to keep gods 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.109
 sustained rhythms become a lot 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.090
 challenging and very tiring level 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.439
 physical however it is the beautiful thing of the 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.450
 bicycle and that allows you to 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.790
 travel to move 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.639
 very long who happened to me a lot 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.130
 often in this year to think about places 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.139
 imaginary encounter and this helps 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.789
 so much because it reveals mental thinking already 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.199
 to be in one place and therefore already 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.759
 travel around the world 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.759
 there is a bit like having already done it 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.790
 grinds miles of road you wanted 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.000
 the bicycle 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.510
 not bad 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.510
 quickly
