00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to this psycho arthur and today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.189
 we will have mouse vidosik this time 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.849
 We fall on the quiet coast of the enemy 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.610
 artillery 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.500
 but as you can see here they have a weak 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.379
 only 2 cobs underdeveloped 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 which is the maximum that I will do it 300 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.000
 hp stove well if I throw a tank under it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 the maximum that they achieve is 500 damage 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.179
 well then on codes and so i'm calm 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.570
 totally going towards heavy 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.500
 three tanks waiting for me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 veteran tanks two fours and IS-7 by 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.860
 In fact, many consider these tanks to be much 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.460
 stronger than the mouse and in principle not in vain 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.460
 the car is really strong but in the hands 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.829
 typical owners of these tanks 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 for some reason, they do n’t bend at all if 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.329
 server statistics turns out that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.270
 Mouse seems to be pulling better than 4 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 Seven in this battle will in principle 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.869
 clearly shows why, but 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 standard such a player in the tank yes to me 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.439
 I’m particularly worried about some 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 let's say the varieties of technology there or 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.400
 some nazis to download something 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.600
 Of course, first you will download scoops here 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 and how exactly knit in the future moment 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.119
 when do you need to pump dozens of what she 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.880
 knits the public so-called on 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 tank that mouse is like that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.799
 just a coffin he did not do anything 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.299
 so that's why they think he died 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.530
 grandfather 7 less than 94 here they are cool we have it 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.860
 so it is a little bit 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.090
 so just just a bonus code on home here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.700
 on when they meet me 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.560
 who don't understand what's wrong with that not 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.420
 drove in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.810
 After all, I collected Shona 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 let's say in the latest fashion 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.270
 Third Reich 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.450
 a bunch of chocolate there just load up 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.540
 dump a bunch of gold just a couple 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.780
 mines of for any 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.200
 waffentragers and by the way recently one more 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.180
 granddaughter appeared you broke down I 4 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.690
 perk and put it here fraternity and replaced 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.299
 it means the method was rammer this 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.230
 him 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.569
 vertical alignment stabilizer and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.849
 I stood under the battle I now took off the stabilizer 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.980
 and because you put plus downloaded fraternity 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.370
 so now the tower spins for me 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.280
 faster recharge better precipitation 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.000
 suffer even more as you see veterans 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 came in three 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.769
 let's say so tried to portray something 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.950
 grandpa on gold me even a few times 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.250
 tried but in fact it did not save them 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.829
 after all, what is to go out and pick them up 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.450
 know here but in principle most 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.670
 such comrades do not know what it is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.930
 when two tanks against you are three of you 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.549
 came out took 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.290
 no, these guys about the other they like 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.840
 calm measured gameplay calm 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.790
 shootout in the case of the mouse when he 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.829
 you tank if you see that hit 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.380
 situation that want you mouse he you 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.829
 punches wresting no then you two 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.459
 option or quickly zarashit while 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.870
 you still have hp or retreat and try 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.480
 pull out like dad dart 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.569
 but in this situation the adversary is not 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.750
 no chance left because you 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.489
 their floor polisher 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.370
 mouseup he's just big yes that is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.060
 tank and there inside the floor near and therefore 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.090
 you have to take two cage polisher 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.549
 but in case of this move deuce they 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.370
 there everything wipes gently but for now 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.209
 the countdown goes then get in the tank and there 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.909
 runs next 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.659
 simple someone kills here they are on 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.120
 on the other flank everyone was killed here but I 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.739
 solved the other flank so just without 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.959
 chances of breaking the bend and all that 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.549
 we need a really heavy tank and not some 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.460
 there only Soviet swing the mouse here in 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.930
 basically everything 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
 I have recently been very much on it 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.610
 skated and now I will hit the whole series whether 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.300
 access to it 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.300
 plan all good luck
