this strap here which you use to keep it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.920 
this strap here which you use to keep it
on<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.970> there's<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.060> of<00:00:42.210> other<00:00:42.420> brands

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on there there's a lot of other brands

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.530 
on there there's a lot of other brands
that<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.080> these<00:00:43.500> types<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.360> heart<00:00:45.360> rate

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
that have these types of heart rate

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.990 
that have these types of heart rate
monitors<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.350> polar<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> suunto

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
monitors you have polar you have suunto

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260 
monitors you have polar you have suunto
so<00:00:48.830> it's<00:00:49.830> very<00:00:49.980> easy<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> try<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> compare<00:00:51.090> them

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so it's very easy to try to compare them

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.310 
so it's very easy to try to compare them
this<00:00:51.360> tries<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.630> be<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.900> little<00:00:52.140> different

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this tries to be a little different

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
this tries to be a little different
because<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.740> point<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.510> because

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
because the point of it is because

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.910 
because the point of it is because
they're<00:00:54.810> Italians<00:00:55.290> they<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.710> something

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
they're Italians they want something

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.320 
they're Italians they want something
that<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.310> could<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.520> wear<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.150> looks

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
that you could actually wear that looks

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.180 
that you could actually wear that looks
kind<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:57.570> cool<00:00:57.810> but<00:00:58.380> there's<00:00:58.650> all<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:59.010> other

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
kind of cool but there's all these other

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
kind of cool but there's all these other
functions<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.390> terms<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.990> heart

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
functions on it so in terms of the heart

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
functions on it so in terms of the heart
rate<00:01:01.350> monitor<00:01:01.410> part<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> works<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.520> I'd<00:01:02.730> say

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
rate monitor part it works well I'd say

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.749 
rate monitor part it works well I'd say
that<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.540> possibly<00:01:04.220> from<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> strict

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
that that possibly from a strict

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.420 
that that possibly from a strict
standpoint<00:01:06.330> people<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.380> polar<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.009> suunto

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
standpoint people like polar and suunto

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.510 
standpoint people like polar and suunto
having<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:10.370> user<00:01:11.370> friendly

see<00:01:54.420> behind<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.440> face<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.010> digital<00:01:56.549> face

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
see behind the face is a digital face

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.390 
see behind the face is a digital face
and<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.320> done<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.860> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.250> more

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
and it's done to be a little bit more

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.450 
and it's done to be a little bit more
discreet<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.120> it's<00:02:00.299> called<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.540> negative<00:02:00.900> LCD

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
discreet and it's called a negative LCD

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.240 
discreet and it's called a negative LCD
meaning<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.580> has<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.860> sort<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.920> dark

background with a lighter colored you

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.469 
background with a lighter colored you
know<00:02:08.129> indicating<00:02:08.580> numerals<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
know indicating numerals on there and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.789 
know indicating numerals on there and
that<00:02:09.810> makes<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.440> more<00:02:10.560> subdued

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
that makes a little bit more subdued

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.160 
that makes a little bit more subdued
it's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> little<00:02:11.280> harder<00:02:11.549> to<00:02:11.580> read<00:02:11.879> though<00:02:12.170> but

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it's a little harder to read though but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.470 
it's a little harder to read though but
it's<00:02:13.200> definitely<00:02:13.939> still<00:02:14.939> something<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.329> can

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
see and it looks cool the functions are

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.180 
see and it looks cool the functions are
pretty<00:02:17.819> bad

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
pretty bad

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.940

there's<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.670> way<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.060> touching<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.930> watch

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
there's a way of just touching the watch

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.130 
there's a way of just touching the watch
not<00:03:09.520> sure<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.000> couldn't<00:03:10.570> quite<00:03:10.750> figure<00:03:10.960> out<00:03:11.050> how

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
not sure I couldn't quite figure out how

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.600 
not sure I couldn't quite figure out how
to<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:11.830> again<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.100> have<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.490> admit

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
to do it but then again I have to admit

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.220 
to do it but then again I have to admit
I<00:03:12.730> didn't<00:03:13.030> take<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> really<00:03:13.540> long<00:03:13.570> time<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.960> look

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
I didn't take a really long time to look

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.000 
I didn't take a really long time to look
at<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.560> instructions<00:03:16.500> basically<00:03:17.500> let<00:03:17.680> me<00:03:17.770> try

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
at the instructions basically let me try

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.110 
at the instructions basically let me try
to<00:03:18.070> find<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.490> mode<00:03:18.670> here<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:21.730> we<00:03:21.850> go<00:03:21.970> this

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
to find the mode here here we go this

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.390 
to find the mode here here we go this
mode<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.600> basically<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.709> touch<00:03:23.980> i<00:03:24.190> think

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
mode so you basically you touch i think

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.960 
mode so you basically you touch i think
the<00:03:24.520> sides<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:26.350> able<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:27.010> read<00:03:27.370> your

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the sides and it's able to read your

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.620 
the sides and it's able to read your
heart<00:03:28.300> rate<00:03:28.570> kind<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.620> at<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.550> glance<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.540> you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
heart rate kind of at a glance so you

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.110 
heart rate kind of at a glance so you
just<00:03:31.900> sort<00:03:32.020> of<00:03:32.080> get<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.320> snapshot<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.940> see

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
just sort of get a snapshot so you see

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.030 
just sort of get a snapshot so you see
like<00:03:34.300> that<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:35.290> doing<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.650> I'm<00:03:35.800> not<00:03:35.920> sure

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
like that it's doing that I'm not sure

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.410 
like that it's doing that I'm not sure
the<00:03:36.160> best<00:03:36.310> way<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.489> doing<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.209> touch

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
the best way of doing it but you touch

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.270 
the best way of doing it but you touch
it<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.810> then<00:03:37.959> it's<00:03:38.290> able<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.590> come<00:03:38.830> up<00:03:38.860> with<00:03:39.010> it

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
it and then it's able to come up with it

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.190 
it and then it's able to come up with it
in<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.880> particular<00:03:40.330> way<00:03:40.360> oh<00:03:40.660> there<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:40.930> go<00:03:40.989> it
