00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.150
 there was something for everyone 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.090
 special video for the magazine 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 bodybuilding woods did it in fact i 'm going 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.419
 to talk to you about two things about coffee and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.400
 tea case so in form we will say 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.420
 food, that is to say, coffee 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.500
 found in commerce 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 so here I use me coffee of origin 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.440
 biological so to try to have 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 something less transformed 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.690
 possible let's say I'll start 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.270
 by the coffee for the first video so 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 the classic coffee that can be used in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.309
 does it as a booster before training 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 but who can be an ally 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.399
 of a diet 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.340
 so during a fat loss it can 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.530
 to be interesting because coffee in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 done at the level of his properties he has 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
 something very interesting it is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 who goes on a diet actually where one 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.869
 is a bar in calories and especially in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 calories from carbohydrates coffee 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.810
 when he is going to be ingested will cause in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.550
 actually going to mobilize the fats make them 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.330
 circulate the blood and use them under 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.369
 form of energy 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.440
 so in fact it's not who goes he goes the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.960
 do that is who will encourage by 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.479
 compared to a more normal situation 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.540
 something that on the other hand causes the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:37.150
 reverse when we consume sugar with 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.979
 it will speed up the placing under reserve of 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.450
 sugar that we will consume for example 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.940
 it's not good to have a coffee 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.790
 after a meal it's not my in addition to 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.530
 to cumulate coffee more sugar so it's not 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.430
 good you'll understand to drink some 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.649
 coca after at the training level 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.840
 and it will play on many things that 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.119
 will play on the concentration already of a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.729
 pretty important part of being good 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.410
 concentrated in training at dosages 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.590
 a little bit higher we will be able 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.119
 slightly increase its strength so to 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.650
 way to actually be either if we 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.900
 was not very fit to succeed at 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.790
 do a session almost as well 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.560
 that if we had been fit and if we 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.630
 is very fit to get a little boost 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.459
 little so do not abuse it because 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.350
 it stops and it's a vicious circle 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.150
 after we always want more so 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.290
 we increase the dosages that's why 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.870
 that I am now confined to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.220
 consume coffee 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 Well that's it like that in capsules that I 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.450
 do in my coffee maker and it helps to 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.090
 take two maximum three before 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.920
 training and to draw from them 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.200
 advantages the advantage of coffee is 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 that he's really going to really boost you 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.640
 in those moments where you are not going to have 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.880
 the force needed to finally do or 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.010
 even the desire to go and train 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.340
 it's not a booster as you can 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.329
 find in the trade who are you going 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.579
 really wake up suddenly and 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.019
 you really provoke a strong desire 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.810
 a nervousness etc 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.390
 it's a little sweeter as a sensation 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.840
 but we already know exactly what 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.260
 that we take and so for the scheme between 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.750
 meals 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.370
 it's very interesting before 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.930
 also training so as to 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.220
 mobilize more fat 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.290
 when doing agen training 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.100
 that's what I also do very 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.450
 interesting if you're sensitive I'm 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.700
 not make recommendations from 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.320
 doctors but if we ever do the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.160
 tachycardia or problems 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.100
 heart 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.260
 it is better to avoid anyway for the sake of 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.450
 common sense 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.150
 it is better to avoid consuming too much 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.720
 caffeine for not having small 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.360
 upset 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.340
 after that so that's it for the first 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.209
 part of the video on the second coffee 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.209
