00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:04.610
 but solved then but a doubt and logic 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.430
 in a long and sad 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.850
 a dissident 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.529
 cetip issue 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.639
 it is considered an action full of following 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.299
 that can be true focus 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.039
 josemaria for cassada in question she will come in white dress 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.609
 the truth tables of propositions 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 simaria does not come in white dress so she is not married 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.570
 yes maria casadei so it is obvious white dress are the same right or 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.070
 wrong 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.480
 to analyze 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 So I wrote these propositions 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.350
 and gets that really it is in guayas because it is the case of the positive tip 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 how to describe 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.860
 get yourself a solution 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 not 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 of solution 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.040
 he did not detail 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.640
 the people and mary scassa of then was to turn of white dress 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 yes this expression is a conditional that can be written as 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.620
 sipri 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.010
 he then 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.220
 It was the life of a white dress that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.380
 we have a conditional 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.730
 which is a compound proposition 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.730
 of type 7 so here 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.690
 then simaria was voiced in white dress words is a website so what 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.080
 the other expression then appears the next day 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.060
 that would be simaria do not come from white dress so she 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.630
 is not married 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.910
 this expression means the following 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.310
 Maria directed white life is fifth 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.550
 soon on your third day that you see here 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.270
 this antecedent 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.770
 is or does not want 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.769
 not that 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.939
 then 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.650
 not his life, she was not married 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.609
 she was not married to 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.409
 to have a line is revoked 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.409
 Maria not married and not here 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.199
 this is according to experts 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.120
 Pedro is s 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.889
 do not lose 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.389
 pierre-marie navy house is not married not have 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.819
 those with dispersion 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.429
 This is how you do not want 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.419
 and if not who does not want 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.639
 these weight from above and 70 do not want 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.809
 and people who download, if not fifth place 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.159
 these two arrests 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.159
 are equivalent amo 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.369
 another but also the skeleton 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:03:00.959
 so he woke up the best students to collect equivalences that 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.159
 valencia barbosa the guy has to know to stop that straw 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.989
 seventy one 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.929
 if he has then that he 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.709
 is equivalent 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.549
 that's where the relative 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.619
 so do not want 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.819
 yes, do not want 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.739
 and so do not lose 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.469
 this equivalence 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.829
 it calls another positive network 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.969
 this is the famous 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.799
 against positive 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.159
 another positive 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.029
 everyone is then wanted seventy 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:39.399
 is equivalent to sign the fifth lot this agreement is positive 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.350
 and two expressions are equivalent 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.459
 if they build the same truth table 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.639
 as you think you do not want is equivalent to 7 you will not feel sorry with a rag 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.669
 citi vote 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.159
 I can say that today has the same truth table 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:02.309
 then equivalent service has the best also in fact or he who 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.059
 was right 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.159
 answer 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.060
 right 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.400
 a matter of the positive shallow bridge 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:16.370
 right answer to 'wife's' ex same truth table 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.439
 answer yes
