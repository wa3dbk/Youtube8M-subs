00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.329
 what is your job 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.049
 because at the beginning I had to 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.209
 to receive 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.089
 I had to smile at everyone 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.939
 but one smiles 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.909
 and people are wrong 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.909
 they have so many men who feel lonely 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
 but you do not need freedom 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.530
 of freedom by not being 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.210
 I did it to sleep with him 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.630
 When I was younger, I believed that life started on the same day as 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.290
 made love and that before 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.290
 so do not do anything 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930
 maybe I loved it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 I was so in love that it would have been the end of the world 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 He said that it had the same effect as a santero 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 but he gets tired fast of four and went to talk on the phone 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.970
 it is curious not 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.180
 how someone can seem to be cast by you when they really are not 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 maybe it is very easy 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.770
 maybe 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.770
 I may not deserve anything better 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.850
 there are people who are born to be happy 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
 to me every day of my life has stressed me 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.500
 I thought to do anything 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 nobody loves Me 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.059
 I'm not happy 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 I do not even know if your designations really 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.949
 because to feel unhappy someone has had to lose the goal 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.019
 I have never had anything 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.169
 good 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.759
 my bad lucky 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.939
 bush 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.939
 how the future of the 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.509
 when 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.119
 in the small the only thing I wanted was 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.779
 these sad 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.779
 Sun wanted everything to happen very quickly but 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.239
 what has served me 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.219
 it's all this 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.829
 to a waiting room 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.739
 it's like a big station with banks and drafts 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.959
 there are a lot of people passing 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.379
 behind the crystals running 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.379
 yes but less 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.659
 kepa something happens
