00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 the number of accidents in 2010 on the highway 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 sc-438 reduced by 14.8 percent compared to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.179
 at the same period last year 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.990
 according to the commander of the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.580
 gravatal 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 the explanation is the use of radar 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.270
 only photographic feels more is in the pocket 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.160
 therefore due to the number of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
 realizes that there has been a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.109
 speed and consequently the reduction 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.369
 in the number of subscribers the radar has 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 infrared sensor that detects 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.030
 of automobiles at a distance of almost 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.890
 100 meters 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.320
 in which case the vehicle is above 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.420
 allowed speed that is 80 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 kilometers per hour in this section 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.540
 equipment records a vehicle photo 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.730
 offender 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.000
 after that it's just the driver to wait 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.070
 by the fine at home is going to 46 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 kilometers per hour before we put 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 the speed to the location and 40 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.120
 kilometers 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 it is still within the tolerance that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 ahead of our post and if by chance 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.430
 he passed with more than what would happen 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.750
 Rodrigo happen a notification to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.500
 to restrain the excess speed of the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 vehicle 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.960
 the maximum of iac here in case 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.270
 would have seven miles more tolerance 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 would thus be 47 kilometers 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.909
 in total there are only six equipment 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.259
 like the one in the whole state and one of them 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.689
 came here because the highway 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.869
 sc-438 is considered the second highway 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.210
 most dangerous of Santa Catarina with the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.369
 drivers, while respecting the limit of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.680
 speed for fear of taking a ticket 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 which ranges from 85 to 574 reais, it is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.790
 the number of accidents decreases this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.140
 is also the reason for the intensification of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.369
 policing on the highway 448 baron a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 large stones 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.570
 here according to prf have already been registered 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.060
 35 accidents this year and of these 26 only in the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 between shark and kilometers 60 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.659
 and fortunately this year we had the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 registration of two deaths is not a 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.210
 child and an adult on that highway 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.099
 photo radar will also be used 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.289
 on the highway, waiting for the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.110
 drivers more respect the limit of 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.700
 speed here is 60 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
 many per hour we reinforce the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 policing the car is going personal 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.270
 itself can perceive that it is coming 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.150
 acting more often there right and 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.050
 within a maximum period of earnings of between ten 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.120
 it's 15 days 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.680
 we will also operate with the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 radar with this radar 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.840
 because when the radar 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.460
 can not be used like this is any 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.890
 way a study has to be done 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.540
 technical foul has been done only 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.880
 signature of the engineer of the deinfra is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.420
 to formalize the operation in that 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.420
 stretch
