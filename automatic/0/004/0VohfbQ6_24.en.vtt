00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.950 
are pretty rigid the iphones rigid even
the<00:01:29.520> new<00:01:29.610> ipod<00:01:29.939> touch<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.329> nano<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.630> pretty

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the new ipod touch and nano or pretty

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
the new ipod touch and nano or pretty
rigid<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.350> i<00:01:31.500> feel<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.979> ipad<00:01:32.159> will

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
rigid and i feel that the ipad will

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.170 
rigid and i feel that the ipad will
probably<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> flat<00:01:33.479> box<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:35.460> yeah<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
probably be a flat box I think yeah the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.789 
probably be a flat box I think yeah the
battery<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> same<00:01:37.409> they'll

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
battery will be about the same they'll

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
battery will be about the same they'll
claim<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.189> same<00:01:38.340> battery<00:01:38.700> life<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.150> will

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
claim the same battery life there will

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.899 
claim the same battery life there will
be<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> new<00:01:40.130> one<00:01:41.130> point<00:01:41.400> two<00:01:41.579> gigahertz

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
be a new one point two gigahertz

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.810 
be a new one point two gigahertz
processor<00:01:42.409> it'll<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> dual-core<00:01:44.130> processor

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
processor it'll be a dual-core processor

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.690 
processor it'll be a dual-core processor

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
will get 3G models pretty much

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.819 
will get 3G models pretty much
everything<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> same<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
everything the same there will be a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.350 
everything the same there will be a
front<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.310> rear<00:02:08.489> facing<00:02:08.700> camera<00:02:09.179> that's

front and rear facing camera that's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
front and rear facing camera that's
pretty<00:02:09.569> much<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.869> given<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.310> other<00:02:11.550> than<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
pretty much a given but other than that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.130 
pretty much a given but other than that
oh<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.480> think<00:02:12.540> they'll<00:02:12.840> pry

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
oh and I think they'll pry

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
oh and I think they'll pry
demo<00:02:13.680> iOS<00:02:14.130> 5<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.700> don't<00:02:14.880> think<00:02:15.030> they're<00:02:15.120> going

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
demo iOS 5 I don't think they're going

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.030 
demo iOS 5 I don't think they're going
to<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.420> 4.3<00:02:16.020> they're<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> skip<00:02:16.680> straight

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to do 4.3 they're going to skip straight

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
to do 4.3 they're going to skip straight
to<00:02:17.100> five<00:02:17.490> they'll<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.750> new<00:02:18.900> integration

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to five they'll do some new integration

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.900 
to five they'll do some new integration
I<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.740> they'll<00:02:19.890> work<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.250> app<00:02:20.490> management

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
I think they'll work on app management

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.360 
I think they'll work on app management
you'll<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.330> able<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.660> more<00:02:22.590> easily<00:02:22.770> kind<00:02:23.220> of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
you'll be able to more easily kind of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.040 
you'll be able to more easily kind of
organize<00:02:23.819> your<00:02:24.000> pages<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.569> can<00:02:24.600> probably

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
organize your pages you can probably

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.750 
organize your pages you can probably
have<00:02:25.140> static<00:02:25.500> icon<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.490> them<00:02:26.640> in

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
have static icon so you can have them in

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.790 
have static icon so you can have them in
formats<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.420> don't<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:28.050> it'll<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.380> fixed

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
formats I don't think it'll be a fixed

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.650 
formats I don't think it'll be a fixed
grid<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.430> think<00:02:29.880> you'll<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.120> able<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> kind<00:02:30.600> of

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
grid I think you'll be able to kind of

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.420 
grid I think you'll be able to kind of
move<00:02:30.810> them<00:02:31.020> around<00:02:31.140> where<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.740> choose<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
move them around where you choose and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.890 
move them around where you choose and
then<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> also<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.120> folders<00:02:33.600> will<00:02:33.810> be

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
then I also think that folders will be

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.720 
then I also think that folders will be
more<00:02:34.140> advanced<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.920> instead<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.220> having<00:02:35.310> 12

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
more advanced so instead of having 12

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.220 
more advanced so instead of having 12
apps<00:02:35.910> or<00:02:36.150> whatever<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.720> folder<00:02:37.080> you'll

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
apps or whatever it is a folder you'll

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.510 
apps or whatever it is a folder you'll
be<00:02:37.350> able<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.709> folders<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.190> sign<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
be able to have folders and sign of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.460 
be able to have folders and sign of
folders<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.030> all<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.270> other<00:02:39.360> good<00:02:39.480> stuff<00:02:39.600> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
folders and all that other good stuff so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.170 
folders and all that other good stuff so
that's<00:02:40.680> my<00:02:40.920> predictions<00:02:41.370> again<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:42.120> be

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's my predictions again I could be

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.670 
that's my predictions again I could be
totally<00:02:42.390> one<00:02:42.720> hundred<00:02:42.780> percent<00:02:43.020> wrong<00:02:43.380> but

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
totally one hundred percent wrong but

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.990 
totally one hundred percent wrong but
that's<00:02:43.890> what<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.100> think<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> think

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
that's what I think what do you think

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.250 
that's what I think what do you think
we're<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.600> see<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> ipad<00:02:46.080> 2

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
we're going to see in the ipad 2
