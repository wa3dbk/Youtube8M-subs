00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.799
 and to follow the caracas movement and analyze facial expressions 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:23.159
 and we also work in another area in the area of ​​robotics doing 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.159
 robotic systems to 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.250

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.770
 is the second largest in Spain 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.360
 also in the faculty has the astronomical observatory of 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.520
 montegancedo 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 located

 one of the blocks of the faculty 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.789
 this robotic observation center 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:36.860
 it also has 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 of a free service weather station 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.540
 the students of the computer science faculty of the university 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.990
 polytechnic of madrid 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.719
 they share libya studies 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.629
 from other faculties and countries participating in the Erasmus program 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.479
 the faculty welcomes every year even gral 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.180
 number of foreign students

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 they 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.029
 two states 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.339
 input 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.259
 everyday 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.259

 othón p 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.400
 this aspect here continues 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 but study in this faculty 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.870
 is to know and participate 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.789
 university lifestyle 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.289
 of leisure cultural activities 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.659
 so decide whether to sport in a natural environment 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.659
 and quality with the latest technological advances 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.360
 trades 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.639
 I think we're going to remember him 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.889
 we are the place to press for information technology 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.009
 i here we are rehearsing 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.660
 I find it incomprehensible 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.660
 improvisation 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.070
 we try too 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.750
 while on special days with activities so they do not share all 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.419
 students and teachers 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.669
 we go through the cafeteria in 8 racket calls me a little attention incorporates a 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.669
 little life 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.449
 little in addition is also planned franky about for example of that action 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.270
 and acting 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.210
 to improve press capabilities ibarra it kind of things that I much that 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.220
 see with oratory the serve to do it or extinction three speeches 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.220
 things like that 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.009
 it is normal that we can find it 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.009
 the popular party 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.659

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.030
 aston villa 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.039
 a sample of technological advances 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.039
 echoes of the history of mankind 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:09.639
 the technological evolution from the first sugar mills to the computers 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:11.479
 more sophisticated 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:14.479
 the advance of humanity
