the service is genuinely very good I'm
quite<00:00:16.350> impressed<00:00:16.710> actually<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.670> kind<00:00:17.910> of

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
quite impressed actually I was kind of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.160 
quite impressed actually I was kind of
prepared<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.529> not<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
prepared to not like it really because I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.439 
prepared to not like it really because I
felt<00:00:22.740> it'd<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.279> an<00:00:23.400> add-on<00:00:23.850> bolted

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
felt it'd be a bit of an add-on bolted

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.970 
felt it'd be a bit of an add-on bolted
on<00:00:24.600> service<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.350> didn't<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:25.650> he'd<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.890> very

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
on service I didn't think he'd be very

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.910 
on service I didn't think he'd be very
tightly<00:00:26.430> integrated<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.900> few<00:00:28.500> things<00:00:28.740> have

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
tightly integrated a few things have

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.540 
tightly integrated a few things have
come<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.750> that<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.500> sure<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> were<00:00:32.099> made

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
come up that I'm not sure that were made

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.590 
come up that I'm not sure that were made
really<00:00:33.120> obvious<00:00:34.790> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> beginning<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.510> not

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
really obvious in the beginning it's not

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.410 
really obvious in the beginning it's not
a<00:00:36.780> streaming<00:00:37.170> service<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.120> you're

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
a streaming service so it's not you're

a streaming service so it's not you're
not<00:00:39.510> gonna<00:00:39.600> click<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> button<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.649> then<00:00:40.800> start

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
watching it you downloads it to the hard

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.250 
watching it you downloads it to the hard
drive<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.340> box<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

thing I would say is the people that are
on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.829> call<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> sky

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
on the I think they call it the sky

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
on the I think they call it the sky
light<00:01:42.270> service<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.020> anytime<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.680> whatever<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

light service or anytime or whatever is
there<00:01:44.280> they're<00:01:44.490> basically<00:01:44.729> they're<00:01:44.909> free

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
there they're basically they're free

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.270 
there they're basically they're free
broadband<00:01:45.600> option<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
broadband option I think that's got to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
broadband option I think that's got to
Gig<00:01:47.490> limit<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> unlimited<00:01:49.380> anyway

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
Gig limit I was on the unlimited anyway

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
Gig limit I was on the unlimited anyway
because<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.820> gaming<00:01:51.000> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
because I do a lot of gaming you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
because I do a lot of gaming you
probably<00:01:52.619> will<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.130> step<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

that<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.179> found

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
that we found

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.410 
that we found
well<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.780> found<00:02:11.050> playing<00:02:11.290> around<00:02:11.470> with<00:02:11.620> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
well that I found playing around with it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.180 
well that I found playing around with it
we<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.569> into<00:02:14.640> any<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:16.030> these<00:02:16.120> subsections<00:02:16.630> and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
we go into any of these subsections and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.710 
we go into any of these subsections and
you<00:02:18.190> obviously<00:02:18.610> get<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> highlights<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.569> way

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you obviously get the highlights and way

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.570 
you obviously get the highlights and way
of<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.930> skywriter<00:02:20.380> pushing<00:02:20.860> at<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.069> moment<00:02:21.459> as

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
of a skywriter pushing at the moment as

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.790 
of a skywriter pushing at the moment as
their<00:02:21.760> big<00:02:21.940> film<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.360> month<00:02:22.540> if<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.620> go

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
their big film of the month if you go

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.440 
their big film of the month if you go
over<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:25.800> all<00:02:26.800> they've<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.270> this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
over to all they've of it this is this

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.479 
over to all they've of it this is this
section<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.959> good<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.860> channel<00:02:30.100> section

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
section is good like the channel section

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.770 
section is good like the channel section
I<00:02:30.580> find<00:02:30.819> quite<00:02:30.970> useful<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.690> just

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I find quite useful because it just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.020 
I find quite useful because it just
narrows<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> down<00:02:32.260> quicker<00:02:32.709> but<00:02:33.550> I'll<00:02:33.790> be

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
narrows it down quicker but I'll be

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.750 
narrows it down quicker but I'll be
using<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.420> primarily<00:02:34.959> all<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:36.519> just<00:02:36.580> a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
using this primarily all it's just a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.970 
using this primarily all it's just a
huge<00:02:37.209> list<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.870> everything<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.500> service

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
huge list of everything on the service

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.559 
huge list of everything on the service
so<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.760> takes<00:02:39.970> quite<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.180> while<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.360> go

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
so and it takes quite a while to go

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.780 
so and it takes quite a while to go
through<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.319> found<00:02:41.920> myself<00:02:42.040> quite<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.400> nice

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
through but I found myself quite a nice

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.670 
through but I found myself quite a nice
little<00:02:43.060> shortcut<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.870> see<00:02:44.050> down<00:02:44.200> there<00:02:44.260> you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
little shortcut you see down there you

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.830 
little shortcut you see down there you
can<00:02:44.800> click<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.160> green<00:02:45.459> button<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.180> remote

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
can click the green button on the remote

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.259 
can click the green button on the remote
and<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.860> skip<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.519> channel<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.239> want

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
and just skip to a channel that you want

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.870 
and just skip to a channel that you want
and<00:02:49.959> because<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.100> hasn't<00:02:51.220> got<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> thumbnails

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
and because it hasn't got the thumbnails

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.190 
and because it hasn't got the thumbnails
in<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.299> feels<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.690> quicker<00:02:53.049> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
in it just feels a little quicker I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.900 
in it just feels a little quicker I
don't<00:02:53.380> know<00:02:53.470> whether<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:54.670> don't<00:02:54.850> know

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
don't know whether that's I don't know

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.100 
don't know whether that's I don't know

whatever<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:29.139> means<00:05:29.320> but<00:05:30.300> basically<00:05:31.300> I

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
whatever that means but basically I

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.240 
whatever that means but basically I
think<00:05:31.570> it's<00:05:31.900> anybody<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.650> lives<00:05:32.860> in<00:05:33.070> an

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
think it's anybody that lives in an

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.550 
think it's anybody that lives in an
exchange<00:05:33.849> that's<00:05:34.419> got<00:05:34.570> sky<00:05:34.810> equipment<00:05:35.349> in<00:05:35.440> it

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
exchange that's got sky equipment in it

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.800 
exchange that's got sky equipment in it
which<00:05:36.250> they<00:05:37.000> would<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:37.300> told<00:05:37.479> you<00:05:37.630> when<00:05:37.750> he

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
which they would have told you when he

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.719 
which they would have told you when he
took<00:05:37.930> your<00:05:38.080> broadband<00:05:38.470> out<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:39.099> basically<00:05:39.490> if

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
took your broadband out and basically if

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.190 
took your broadband out and basically if

you're getting anything more than about

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.930 
you're getting anything more than about
eight<00:05:41.470> Meg<00:05:41.740> you're<00:05:42.099> probably<00:05:42.340> on<00:05:42.639> their

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
eight Meg you're probably on their

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.980 
eight Meg you're probably on their

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
line rental so that might be a good

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.950 
line rental so that might be a good
indicator<00:05:50.229> as<00:05:50.349> well<00:05:51.270> it's<00:05:52.270> all<00:05:52.479> plugged<00:05:52.690> into

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960

the standard Sky router and that the
Wi-Fi<00:05:56.949> on<00:05:57.099> a<00:05:57.220> river<00:05:57.550> is<00:05:57.760> absolutely<00:05:58.539> useless

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
Wi-Fi on a river is absolutely useless

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.409 
Wi-Fi on a river is absolutely useless
so<00:05:59.889> on<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.430> back<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.789> route<00:06:00.970> I've<00:06:01.180> plugged

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
so on the back of the route I've plugged

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.000 
so on the back of the route I've plugged
one<00:06:01.599> of<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:01.750> ethernet<00:06:02.110> ports<00:06:02.380> into<00:06:02.560> my<00:06:02.830> in

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
one of the ethernet ports into my in

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.529 
one of the ethernet ports into my in
grade<00:06:03.250> router<00:06:03.520> which<00:06:03.760> I'm<00:06:03.910> really<00:06:04.150> happy<00:06:04.330> with

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
grade router which I'm really happy with

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.600 
grade router which I'm really happy with
and<00:06:05.349> just<00:06:05.470> turn<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.770> Wi-Fi<00:06:05.919> off<00:06:06.250> on<00:06:06.430> their

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
and just turn the Wi-Fi off on their

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.150 
and just turn the Wi-Fi off on their
route<00:06:06.789> so<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:08.169> one<00:06:08.380> one<00:06:08.650> of<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.830> other<00:06:08.949> eye

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
route so and one one of the other eye

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.469 
route so and one one of the other eye
Ethernet<00:06:09.430> ports<00:06:09.789> are<00:06:09.910> quite<00:06:10.030> now<00:06:10.210> plugged

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.870 
Ethernet ports are quite now plugged
into<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:10.750> HD<00:06:11.080> box<00:06:11.349> so<00:06:11.830> that<00:06:12.160> seems<00:06:12.669> to<00:06:12.729> be<00:06:12.789> a

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
into the HD box so that seems to be a

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.900 
into the HD box so that seems to be a
good<00:06:13.030> solution<00:06:13.300> around<00:06:14.430> bypass<00:06:15.430> in<00:06:15.669> their

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
good solution around bypass in their

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.400 
good solution around bypass in their
route<00:06:16.419> because<00:06:16.720> I<00:06:16.750> know<00:06:16.900> a<00:06:16.930> lot<00:06:17.110> of<00:06:17.139> people

route because I know a lot of people

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.210 
route because I know a lot of people
don't<00:06:17.500> like<00:06:17.740> it<00:06:17.770> but<00:06:19.800> I've<00:06:20.800> done<00:06:20.949> all<00:06:21.039> the

don't like it but I've done all the
