their front side out is going to cost

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160 
their front side out is going to cost
them<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.150> it's<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.570> something<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.110> think

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
them so it's just something to think

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.080 
them so it's just something to think
about<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.400> need<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:35.790> short

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
about because I really need to be short

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
about because I really need to be short

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
closed know what I mean by closed if you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.530 
closed know what I mean by closed if you
see<00:02:46.290> my<00:02:46.410> front<00:02:46.740> foot<00:02:46.800> what<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.640> mean<00:02:47.940> by<00:02:48.090> closed

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
see my front foot what I mean by closed

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.680 
see my front foot what I mean by closed
is<00:02:48.870> when<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> stride<00:02:49.860> my<00:02:50.760> front<00:02:51.090> foot<00:02:51.150> right<00:02:51.480> now

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
is when I stride my front foot right now

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.260 
is when I stride my front foot right now
is<00:02:51.959> basically<00:02:52.610> parallel<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.940> front<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
is basically parallel to the front of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.960 
is basically parallel to the front of
the<00:02:54.360> plate<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.840> when<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.830> my<00:02:56.370> foot<00:02:56.670> plant

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the plate and when I have my foot plant

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.150 
the plate and when I have my foot plant
you're<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.350> maintain<00:02:58.650> this

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
you're going to see that I maintain this

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.910 
you're going to see that I maintain this
squared<00:02:59.580> position<00:03:00.180> right<00:03:00.360> here<00:03:00.920> that's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
squared position right here that's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.790 
squared position right here that's
because<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.459> have<00:03:02.610> very<00:03:02.790> flexible<00:03:03.150> hips<00:03:03.800> guys

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
because I have very flexible hips guys

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.920 
because I have very flexible hips guys
that<00:03:05.100> don't<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.370> flexible<00:03:05.910> hips<00:03:06.150> they're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
that don't have flexible hips they're

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.710 
that don't have flexible hips they're
going<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.170> open<00:03:07.350> their<00:03:07.680> foot<00:03:07.950> more<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:09.300> accept

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
going to open their foot more the accept

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.960 
going to open their foot more the accept
acceptable<00:03:10.620> angle<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.190> about<00:03:11.430> 45<00:03:11.940> degrees

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
acceptable angle is about 45 degrees

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.630 
acceptable angle is about 45 degrees
from<00:03:12.600> most<00:03:12.810> hitting<00:03:13.110> coaches<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.340> I'll<00:03:14.430> show

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
from most hitting coaches so I'll show

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.620 
from most hitting coaches so I'll show
you<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:14.910> looks<00:03:15.270> like

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
you what that looks like

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.770 
you what that looks like
a<00:03:15.660> 45<00:03:16.500> degree<00:03:16.790> foot<00:03:17.790> angle<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.300> about<00:03:18.510> right

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
a 45 degree foot angle is about right

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.760 
a 45 degree foot angle is about right
there<00:03:19.050> but<00:03:19.620> here's<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.040> key<00:03:20.250> if<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:22.020> I<00:03:22.230> want

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
there but here's the key if I if I want

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.440 
there but here's the key if I if I want
to<00:03:22.920> get<00:03:23.070> my<00:03:23.190> foot<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> 45<00:03:24.120> degree<00:03:24.150> angle

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
to get my foot to a 45 degree angle

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.539 
to get my foot to a 45 degree angle
because<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:25.500> where<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:25.799> comfortable<00:03:26.280> I'm

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
because that's where I'm comfortable I'm

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.000 
because that's where I'm comfortable I'm
fine<00:03:27.330> with<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.570> but<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.230> needs<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.560> happen<00:03:28.739> on

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
fine with that but it needs to happen on

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.479 
fine with that but it needs to happen on
the<00:03:29.100> stride<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.530> needs<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.980> happen<00:03:32.130> on<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
the stride so it needs to happen on the

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.000 
the stride so it needs to happen on the
stride<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.060> when<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.630> stride<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.170> need<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.680> get<00:03:34.860> in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
stride so when I stride I need to get in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.130 
stride so when I stride I need to get in
that<00:03:35.100> position<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.480> control<00:03:36.900> my

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
that position because I can control my

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.430 
that position because I can control my
front<00:03:37.440> knee<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.610> control<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.019> can

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
front knee I can control it now you can

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
front knee I can control it now you can
see<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:40.769> foots<00:03:41.070> open<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.730> where<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.060> my<00:03:42.209> front

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
see my foots open but where is my front

can't<00:03:53.850> keep<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.600> naturally<00:03:55.170> goes

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
can't keep it in it just naturally goes
