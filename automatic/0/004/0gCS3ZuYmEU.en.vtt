00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Welcome to an invitation 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.879
 video from palma is showing this video 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.330
 how to use the radio navigation system 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.540
 chandler g6 plus with the free 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.849
 Software around many additional categories 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 can expand 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.449
 first in the first step you take to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 the Kramer navigation system the micro 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.060
 sd memory card and put this in 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.180
 a suitable card reader on the pc now 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.460
 you start the previously installed one 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.610
 software download is on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 the website and once the pace 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.129
 software is started is a device 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.620
 Search performed the all 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.969
 connected and compatible 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.340
 navigation systems and so on 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.870
 Also the memory card as compatible 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.370
 navigation system now recognizes 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.370
 all detected devices have been displayed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.800
 and we now choose the climate system 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.320
 with the rc win 6 software now are 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.439
 We are in the main menu and first 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.380
 We should be in the settings in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.869
 Settings the high-resolution icons 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.450
 activate 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.080
 because the dissolution of the klemmer 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.060
 Navigation system is quite high and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.420
 Here it just slides out of the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.159
 higher resolution 1 can be used 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.520
 Most categories is this high 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 resolution already deposited now 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 We choose to download Prussia 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.040
 download 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.720
 the categories from within us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.740
 interested in my private 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.159
 there is also the possibility pools 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.329
 own categories from tsv came l and gpx 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.740
 if create 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.150
 There is an own video for example auto 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 and traffic we are interested in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380
 Gas is now filling up here 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.850
 the categories how many prices in this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 category very depressed just behind 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.320
 to add on and so can now through the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090
 different categories go to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.130
 example in one 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.500
 the under tank has interested here 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.479

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.429
 add all 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.680
 Most are over 500,000 apps 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.890
 There are also a few for free 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
 Chargeable categories of castles 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.680
 For example, the leader is very interesting 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.810
 You can go up here too 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.010
 click to add and so can the whole 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.540
 Add page 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.900
 and of course there are those too 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.060
 Possibility safety and blitzer here 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.170
 for example, the German stationary 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
 feed speed cameras 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.610
 you have now selected all categories 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.530
 you can again under mine 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.560
 selected Pruss the selection 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.560
 control and then click right 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.209
 down to update on the data now 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.150
 from the shopper server to load 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.060
 in the right format to convert and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.900
 to save to the SD memory card 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 everything is automatic 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.630
 so now the download was successful one 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.690
 looks now have been over altogether 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.490
 20,000 price on the memory card 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.990
 installed and this message came with ok 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.100
 confirm and that is the transfer 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.140
 completed 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.300
 The memory card can now be removed from the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.000
 card reader and into the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:32.390
 topic radio navigation system plugged 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.610
 after the memory card 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:41.000
 has inserted the navigation 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:43.970
 start and get now the hint that 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.200
 a new database was found and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.930
 You will be asked if you import 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.430
 I want to confirm what you ok with now 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.050
 you can see on the top right that the import 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.660
 runs depending on how many categories 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.730
 one has loaded on the memory card 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.830
 The import takes 20 to 30 seconds 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.600
 but this import only occurs once 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.660
 So not every time you start the navis 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.330
 but only if new databases too 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.670
 were loaded on the memory card 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.959
 come back to this import at this 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.850
 maybe still the hint that 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.280
 it is currently only possible because 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.110
 to take over from bombay categories at 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.079
 all pools in each country 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.640
 are and not transnational but 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.229
 That's the same with most categories 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.640
 in paris the case so now comes the 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.450
 message that the pace succeeds 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.450
 were imported 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.180
 and you are now on the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.039
 map and in principle one can to the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.410
 imported price say that is in 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.599
 all concerned with attitude and 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.270
 representation behave just like the 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.520
 preinstalled price so if you want to 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.870
 For example, you can go to the menu 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.210
 the imported poor's under 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.069
 attitudes preferred boys see here 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.770
 you now import the ones imported from us 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.800
 categories first the blitzer 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.259
 categories then the castles or even the 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.330
 fast food categories and the natural gas 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.889
 petrol stations you go for one 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.990
 category on it you can here 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.880
 you can do different options 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.110
 Just delete this category 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.370
 you can also go here for example 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.160
 Choose if you have one 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.750

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.820
 in the selection in the target selection in 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.020
 the main category is displayed 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.949
 let's do it for the natural gas 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:29.159
 Gas stations can navigate well 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.669
 For example, you can do it close by and 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:35.099
 here are all preußen the near 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:39.840

 Show on the map and you see 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.210
 here too the icons we imported 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:40.610
