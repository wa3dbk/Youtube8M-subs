00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
problem is there is a solution well like
for<00:01:45.180> me<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.509> feel<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.229> lashes<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.070> kind<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
for me I feel like my lashes are kind of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.749 
for me I feel like my lashes are kind of
short

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
short

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
short
I<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.240> them<00:01:48.360> curling<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.380> longer

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
I want them curling I want them longer

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.760 
I want them curling I want them longer
so<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.369> all-of-the-above<00:01:51.770> typo

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
so is there an all-of-the-above typo

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
so is there an all-of-the-above typo
option<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.490> good<00:01:53.640> question<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
option that's a good question and I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.450 
option that's a good question and I
think<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> comes<00:01:55.710> down<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.250> is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
think that what that comes down to is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.450 
think that what that comes down to is
kind<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.869> mascara<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
kind of how you put the mascara on and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.810 
kind of how you put the mascara on and
also<00:01:59.969> doubling<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.290> by<00:02:02.009> putting<00:02:02.399> more<00:02:02.610> than

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
also doubling up so by putting more than

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.230 
also doubling up so by putting more than
one

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
one

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
one
kote<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.810> lashes<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.040> get

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
kote on your lashes you're going to get

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.460 
kote on your lashes you're going to get
a<00:02:05.280> better<00:02:05.640> effect<00:02:06.119> okay<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
a better effect okay that's that's a

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.969 
a better effect okay that's that's a
really<00:02:07.649> good<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.840> pray<00:02:09.840> though<00:02:10.170> three<00:02:10.590> coats<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
really good to pray though three coats I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.540 
really good to pray though three coats I

like it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.000
