00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so here's an alternative to walkways and

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.090 
so here's an alternative to walkways and
decks<00:00:03.060> using<00:00:03.689> these<00:00:03.810> concrete<00:00:04.380> piers<00:00:04.740> and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
decks using these concrete piers and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.280 
decks using these concrete piers and
these<00:00:05.250> metal<00:00:05.640> pins<00:00:05.940> very<00:00:06.270> very<00:00:07.020> little

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
these metal pins very very little

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.470 
these metal pins very very little

give us a hand and let's go see how they

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.680 
give us a hand and let's go see how they
work<00:00:13.790> all<00:00:14.790> right<00:00:14.940> well<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> bridge

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
work all right well we have the bridge

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.000 
work all right well we have the bridge
in<00:00:15.839> pretty<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.080> location<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.980> think

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
in pretty much location I think

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.380 
in pretty much location I think
everybody's<00:00:17.580> happy<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> right

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
everybody's happy we have the right

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
everybody's happy we have the right
angle<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.990> across<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.470> creek<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
angle going across the creek we have a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
angle going across the creek we have a
distributed<00:00:21.330> evenly<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.900> both<00:00:21.930> sides<00:00:22.439> now

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
distributed evenly on both sides now

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.560 
distributed evenly on both sides now
here's<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> plan<00:00:23.460> we're<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
here's the plan we're going with this is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.000 
here's the plan we're going with this is
the<00:00:24.689> side<00:00:24.930> view<00:00:24.960> looking<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> creek

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the side view looking up the creek

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
the side view looking up the creek
seeing<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.240> our<00:00:27.630> piers<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.170> on

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
seeing see we have our piers here on

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.750 
seeing see we have our piers here on
either<00:00:28.380> side<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> view<00:00:29.279> looking<00:00:29.429> down

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
either side this is a view looking down

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240 
either side this is a view looking down
on<00:00:30.179> top<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.720> bridge<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.769> each<00:00:31.949> side

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
on top of the bridge so on each side

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.380 
on top of the bridge so on each side
this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> where<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> piers<00:00:33.000> go<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
this is where the piers go we have a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.170 
this is where the piers go we have a
appear<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.559> each<00:00:34.829> outside<00:00:35.340> edge<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.059> we

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
appear on each outside edge and then we

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
appear on each outside edge and then we
have<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.079> center<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> way<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
have one right in the center the way I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.069 
have one right in the center the way I
understand<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> instead<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> digging<00:00:39.840> down

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
understand it instead of digging down

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.630 
understand it instead of digging down
four<00:00:40.410> feet<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.010> below<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> frost

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
four feet to get down below the frost

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
four feet to get down below the frost
line<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.960> taking<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
line we're just to be taking out a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
line we're just to be taking out a
little<00:00:43.590> bit<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> dirt<00:00:44.040> enough<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> level<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
little bit of dirt enough to level the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
little bit of dirt enough to level the
pier<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.719> driving<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> pegs

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
pier then driving it in with the pegs

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.779 
pier then driving it in with the pegs
right<00:00:46.950> perfect

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
right perfect

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.770 
right perfect
okay<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> talk<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> little<00:00:48.600> bit<00:00:48.750> about

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
okay you want to talk a little bit about

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
okay you want to talk a little bit about
how<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> work<00:00:49.649> well<00:00:50.219> system<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
how this is going to work well system is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
how this is going to work well system is
based<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.000> pin<00:00:51.180> pile<00:00:51.390> technology<00:00:52.020> where<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
based on pin pile technology where the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
based on pin pile technology where the
weight<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.890> transferred<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.730> head<00:00:53.940> into

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
weight is transferred from the head into

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
weight is transferred from the head into
the<00:00:54.360> pin<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> pin<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> load<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the pin so the pin has all the load and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
the pin so the pin has all the load and
all<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> uplift<00:00:56.910> resistance<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> system

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
all the uplift resistance in the system

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
all the uplift resistance in the system
now<00:00:58.559> these<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> flat<00:00:59.670> top<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.359> accommodate

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
now these have a flat top to accommodate

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.479 
now these have a flat top to accommodate
any<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> fastener<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.859> top<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.399> a

nationally<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> last<00:01:26.610> 17<00:01:27.060> years<00:01:27.090> with

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
nationally over the last 17 years with

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
nationally over the last 17 years with
the<00:01:27.810> National<00:01:28.200> Park<00:01:28.439> systems<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> in

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the National Park systems they use it in

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
the National Park systems they use it in
wetland<00:01:30.270> areas<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.170> has<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.380> long<00:01:31.619> pipe<00:01:31.829> down

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
wetland areas it has a long pipe down

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.050 
wetland areas it has a long pipe down
environment<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
environment because you don't have to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.219 
environment because you don't have to
have<00:01:33.150> machinery<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.689> bring<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> back<00:01:34.020> there

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
have machinery to bring it back there

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
have machinery to bring it back there
you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.439> carry<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.240> take<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you can carry it and also we just take a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850 
you can carry it and also we just take a
small<00:01:36.600> amount<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.020> dirt<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.710> set

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
small amount of dirt out just and set

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
small amount of dirt out just and set
the<00:01:37.979> head<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> don't<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.270> any<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the head in so you don't have any of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.390 
the head in so you don't have any of
those<00:01:39.659> issues<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.590> runaway<00:01:41.070> erosion

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
those issues of runaway erosion

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.460 
those issues of runaway erosion
and<00:01:42.850> then<00:01:43.000> this<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.150> removable<00:01:43.540> -<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:44.350> is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
and then this is removable - it is

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.840 
and then this is removable - it is
removable<00:01:44.860> which<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.190> nice<00:01:45.370> is<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.730> change

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
removable which is nice is it to change

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.250 
removable which is nice is it to change
mind<00:01:46.330> or<00:01:46.510> you<00:01:46.600> think<00:01:46.810> where<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.080> want<00:01:47.200> the

mind or you think where you want the
bridge<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.590> go<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.830> can<00:01:47.950> pull<00:01:48.130> them<00:01:48.190> out<00:01:48.280> and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
bridge to go you can pull them out and

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.980 
bridge to go you can pull them out and
move<00:01:48.580> them<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:49.060> happens<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.420> lot<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.720> deck

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
move them it happens a lot with deck

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.810 
move them it happens a lot with deck
construction<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.130> they<00:01:51.250> may<00:01:51.370> want<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.580> move<00:01:51.730> a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
construction so they may want to move a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.850 
construction so they may want to move a
stairway<00:01:52.240> or<00:01:52.450> they<00:01:53.230> want<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.440> add<00:01:53.560> something

digging down in this area 42 inches into
the<00:02:00.370> ground<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.910> then<00:02:01.030> 12<00:02:01.270> inches<00:02:01.510> around<00:02:01.630> I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
the ground and then 12 inches around I

ready<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> put<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.440> pins<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.770> all<00:02:35.830> these<00:02:35.950> pins

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
ready to put the pins and all these pins

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.310 
ready to put the pins and all these pins
have<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.490> little<00:02:36.850> tip<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.750> put<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.170> the

have a little tip that you put on the
end<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:38.980> helps<00:02:39.190> them<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.400> through<00:02:39.460> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
end that just helps them get through the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.050 
end that just helps them get through the
ground

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
ground

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.610 
ground
yep<00:02:40.270> helps<00:02:40.630> ease<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.840> travel<00:02:41.410> into<00:02:41.590> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
yep helps ease the travel into the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.110 
yep helps ease the travel into the
ground<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.100> also<00:02:42.250> keeps<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> dirt<00:02:42.880> from

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
ground it also keeps the dirt from

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.580 
ground it also keeps the dirt from
backing<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.600> on<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> inside<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.410> pipe

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
backing up on the inside of the pipe

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.200 
backing up on the inside of the pipe
that<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> inspector<00:02:45.520> can<00:02:45.640> slide<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> tape

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
that way the inspector can slide a tape

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.970 
that way the inspector can slide a tape
measure<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.930> verify<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.320> depth<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
measure down and verify the depth on the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.100 
measure down and verify the depth on the
pin<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.640> footed<00:02:49.000> footing<00:02:49.420> inspection<00:02:49.900> later

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
pin for footed footing inspection later

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.760 
pin for footed footing inspection later
so<00:02:50.830> four<00:02:51.100> pins<00:02:51.420> do<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.570> whole<00:02:52.690> operation<00:02:53.350> yep

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
so four pins do the whole operation yep

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.890 
so four pins do the whole operation yep
just<00:02:54.430> place<00:02:54.700> those<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.540> what's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
just place those in like so and what's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.220 
just place those in like so and what's
all<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.260> pins<00:02:56.500> are<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.860> then<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:58.230> matter

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
all the pins are in then it's a matter

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.199 
all the pins are in then it's a matter
of<00:02:59.320> hauling<00:02:59.680> out<00:02:59.830> what<00:03:00.730> do<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.850> start<00:03:01.030> with<00:03:01.150> a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
of hauling out what do you start with a

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.640 
of hauling out what do you start with a
sledge<00:03:01.510> usually<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.170> start<00:03:02.260> with<00:03:02.530> a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
sledge usually I start with a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.449 
sledge usually I start with a
sledgehammer

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
sledgehammer

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.979 
sledgehammer
just<00:03:03.970> kind<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.209> take<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.390> look<00:03:04.540> at<00:03:04.690> my<00:03:04.780> level

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
just kind of take a look at my level

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.240 
just kind of take a look at my level
make<00:03:05.260> sure<00:03:05.290> we're<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.830> right<00:03:06.040> vicinity

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
make sure we're in the right vicinity

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.180 
make sure we're in the right vicinity
and<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:07.600> start<00:03:07.810> tapping<00:03:08.170> them<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.380> okay<00:03:09.010> so

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and just start tapping them in okay so

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.740 
and just start tapping them in okay so
once<00:03:09.489> once<00:03:09.880> these<00:03:10.000> are<00:03:10.060> set<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.450> has<00:03:10.570> time

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
once once these are set that has time

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.990 
once once these are set that has time
for<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.959> jackhammer<00:03:11.410> right<00:03:11.680> yep<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.850> looks

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
for the jackhammer right yep so it looks

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.760 
for the jackhammer right yep so it looks
like<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.239> have<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.390> custom<00:03:13.840> tip<00:03:14.080> on<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
like you have a custom tip on the on the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.410 
like you have a custom tip on the on the
end<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.010> jackhammer<00:03:15.459> yeah<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.239> got<00:03:16.390> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
end of the jackhammer yeah it's got a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.420 
end of the jackhammer yeah it's got a
center<00:03:16.690> pin<00:03:16.959> here<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.380> keeps<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.920> head

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
center pin here that keeps the head

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.370 
center pin here that keeps the head
centered<00:03:18.850> on<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.239> on<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.660> diamond<00:03:19.989> pure<00:03:20.170> pin

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
centered on the on the diamond pure pin

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.380 
centered on the on the diamond pure pin
keep<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:20.980> from<00:03:21.160> slipping<00:03:21.520> off<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:22.239> that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
keep this from slipping off and that

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.030 
keep this from slipping off and that
jackhammer<00:03:22.780> do<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.110> enough<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.739> get<00:03:23.860> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
jackhammer do is enough to just get that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
jackhammer do is enough to just get that
whole<00:03:24.220> thing<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:24.580> into<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.820> ground

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
whole thing right into the ground

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.180 
whole thing right into the ground
hopefully<00:03:25.540> but<00:03:26.260> looks<00:03:26.470> like<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.769> little<00:03:27.010> tip

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
hopefully but looks like that little tip

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.740 
hopefully but looks like that little tip
on<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.430> jackhammer<00:03:27.940> leaves<00:03:28.269> these<00:03:28.480> things

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
on the jackhammer leaves these things

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.050 
on the jackhammer leaves these things
out<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.470> exact<00:03:29.830> amount<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.220> need<00:03:30.430> yep

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
out just the exact amount you need yep

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.759 
out just the exact amount you need yep
we<00:03:31.239> want<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.450> put<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.780> weather-tight<00:03:32.080> cap<00:03:32.530> on

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
we want to put the weather-tight cap on

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.340 
we want to put the weather-tight cap on
make<00:03:33.070> sure<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> elements<00:03:33.730> stay<00:03:33.910> out<00:03:34.090> also<00:03:34.989> if

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
make sure the elements stay out also if

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.810 
make sure the elements stay out also if
you<00:03:35.440> ever<00:03:35.470> need<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.800> pull<00:03:36.040> these<00:03:36.190> back<00:03:36.250> out<00:03:36.640> you

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you ever need to pull these back out you

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.550 
you ever need to pull these back out you
can<00:03:37.000> simply<00:03:37.480> hook<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> pipe<00:03:37.959> wrench<00:03:38.140> on<00:03:38.410> there

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
can simply hook a pipe wrench on there

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.960 
can simply hook a pipe wrench on there
and<00:03:38.709> pry<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:38.890> back<00:03:39.160> out<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.640> want<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.880> have

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and pry it back out so you want to have

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.780 
and pry it back out so you want to have
something<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.330> grab<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.980> attach<00:03:42.550> our

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
something to grab and so to attach our

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.610 
something to grab and so to attach our
beam<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.480> top<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:43.959> we're<00:03:44.470> going<00:03:44.560> to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
beam then to the top here we're going to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.790 
beam then to the top here we're going to
use<00:03:44.830> standard<00:03:45.640> toe<00:03:46.000> space<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> nut

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
use standard toe space with the nut

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.050 
use standard toe space with the nut
that's<00:03:47.980> holding<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.340> down<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.910> head

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
that's holding it down to the head

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.300 
that's holding it down to the head
itself<00:03:49.420> okay<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.350> then<00:03:50.590> we've<00:03:50.769> got<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.950> piece

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
itself okay and then we've got a piece

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.120 
itself okay and then we've got a piece
of<00:03:51.340> composite<00:03:51.970> decking

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
of composite decking

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.380 
of composite decking
goes<00:03:53.280> over<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.640> top<00:03:53.850> that's<00:03:54.060> right<00:03:54.270> in<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
goes over the top that's right in the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.060 
goes over the top that's right in the
top<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:54.960> our<00:03:55.050> beam<00:03:55.230> will<00:03:55.380> sit<00:03:55.560> right<00:03:55.590> here<00:03:55.770> and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
top so our beam will sit right here and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.560 
top so our beam will sit right here and
we<00:03:56.160> screw<00:03:56.460> it<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.700> side<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.120> we<00:03:57.180> better

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
we screw it in the side and we better

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.570 
we screw it in the side and we better
yep<00:03:57.780> selves<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.170> good<00:03:58.350> connection<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.370> we<00:03:59.400> have

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
yep selves a good connection so we have

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.770 
yep selves a good connection so we have
one<00:03:59.730> more<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.000> go<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.300> center<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.690> then

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
one more to go in the center and then

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180 
one more to go in the center and then
we're<00:04:00.960> done<00:04:01.050> with<00:04:01.110> this<00:04:01.320> side<00:04:01.530> yep

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
we're done with this side yep

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.940 
we're done with this side yep
and<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> slick<00:04:03.270> system<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.380> again<00:04:04.710> our

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and that is a slick system so again our

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.010 
and that is a slick system so again our
bridge<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.310> about<00:04:05.400> four<00:04:05.880> feet<00:04:06.120> wide<00:04:06.330> with<00:04:06.990> a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
bridge is about four feet wide with a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.440 
bridge is about four feet wide with a
beam<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.410> each<00:04:07.680> side<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.490> two<00:04:08.970> backs<00:04:09.240> back

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
beam on each side and two backs back

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.120 
beam on each side and two backs back
down<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.780> middle<00:04:09.960> as<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.560> result<00:04:10.890> we<00:04:11.010> have

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
down the middle as a result we have

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.910 
down the middle as a result we have
three<00:04:11.430> piers<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:12.060> both<00:04:12.330> sides<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:13.500> means<00:04:13.740> we

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
three piers on both sides that means we
