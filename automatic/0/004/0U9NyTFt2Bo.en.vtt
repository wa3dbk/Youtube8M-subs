gonna cut out her whiskers umm the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.729 
gonna cut out her whiskers umm the
whiskers<00:02:10.789> are<00:02:10.940> cut<00:02:11.209> inside<00:02:11.840> for<00:02:12.319> aspect<00:02:12.620> as

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
whiskers are cut inside for aspect as

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.259 
whiskers are cut inside for aspect as
well<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.099> just<00:02:13.129> have<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.549> make<00:02:13.790> two<00:02:14.000> little

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
well so you just have to make two little

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.710 
well so you just have to make two little
snips<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:18.700> we're<00:02:19.700> doing<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.060> because<00:02:20.299> it's

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
snips and we're doing this because it's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.259 
snips and we're doing this because it's
easier<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.950> layer<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.549> white<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.910> top<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
easier to just layer the white on top of

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.089 
easier to just layer the white on top of
the<00:02:23.360> black<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.930> black<00:02:24.079> eyes<00:02:24.620> and

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
the black and have the black eyes and

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.180 
the black and have the black eyes and
whiskers<00:02:25.489> showing<00:02:25.849> through<00:02:26.090> then<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:27.129> try<00:02:28.129> to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
whiskers showing through then to try to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.960 
whiskers showing through then to try to
piece<00:02:29.090> them<00:02:29.360> all<00:02:29.569> correctly<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:33.970> simplifying

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
piece them all correctly so simplifying

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.080 
piece them all correctly so simplifying
a<00:02:35.209> little<00:02:35.510> bit<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.739> once<00:02:37.069> we<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
a little bit so once we have the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.050 
a little bit so once we have the
whiskers<00:02:38.420> cut<00:02:38.629> out<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.890> we're<00:02:40.790> also

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
whiskers cut out like that we're also

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.849 
whiskers cut out like that we're also
going<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.989> take<00:02:42.859> out<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.340> eyes<00:02:44.739> which<00:02:45.739> I

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
going to take out the eyes which I

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.289 
going to take out the eyes which I
already<00:02:46.040> cut<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.489> cuts<00:02:46.670> all<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.970> way<00:02:47.000> through

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
already cut it cuts all the way through

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.539 
already cut it cuts all the way through
so<00:02:47.630> don't<00:02:48.620> worry<00:02:48.829> about<00:02:48.950> cutting<00:02:49.430> those

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
so don't worry about cutting those

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.860 
so don't worry about cutting those
they'll<00:02:49.790> be<00:02:49.940> cut<00:02:50.120> out<00:02:50.150> well<00:02:50.420> take<00:02:50.599> out<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
they'll be cut out well take out the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.599 
they'll be cut out well take out the
eyes<00:02:51.019> in<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.349> nose<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.099> white<00:02:55.370> should

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
eyes in the nose so the white should

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:03.890 
eyes in the nose so the white should
look<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.209> take<00:02:56.900> your<00:02:57.019> transfer<00:02:57.410> tape

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.160 

take<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> sticky<00:03:04.980> side<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:06.569> stick<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.989> on

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
take the sticky side and stick it on

so you take the backing off so you

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:08.339 
so you take the backing off so you

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.780 
using the backing of the transmitter
this<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.940> same<00:04:36.150> transportable<00:04:36.780> easy<00:04:37.790> to

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
this is the same transportable easy to

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.880 
this is the same transportable easy to
place<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.180> on<00:04:39.300> your<00:04:39.510> car<00:04:40.110> or<00:04:40.350> wherever<00:04:40.590> you're

so<00:04:44.990> and<00:04:45.349> if<00:04:45.620> there<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:45.949> little<00:04:46.309> bit<00:04:46.400> of

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
so and if there is a little bit of

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.760 
so and if there is a little bit of
overlap<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.090> can<00:04:47.240> always<00:04:47.419> just<00:04:48.289> touch<00:04:48.529> those

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
overlap you can always just touch those

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.580 
overlap you can always just touch those
up<00:04:48.949> later<00:04:49.360> with<00:04:50.360> your<00:04:50.509> scissors<00:04:50.719> let's<00:04:51.349> do<00:04:51.559> a

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
the little centers you can see little

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.929 
the little centers you can see little
centers<00:04:56.029> of<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.270> bow<00:04:56.650> use<00:04:57.650> these<00:04:57.889> centers<00:04:58.370> or

00:04:58.929 --> 00:04:58.939 
centers of the bow use these centers or

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:07.809 
centers of the bow use these centers or
the<00:04:59.900> spoke<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:04.419> put<00:05:05.419> an<00:05:05.539> apart<00:05:06.490> it<00:05:07.490> should<00:05:07.639> only

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
the spoke so put an apart it should only

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:36.629 
the spoke so put an apart it should only
be<00:05:07.969> attached<00:05:08.449> by<00:05:08.839> two<00:05:09.559> little<00:05:09.710> spots

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.119 

there's<00:05:36.909> a<00:05:37.000> little<00:05:37.240> outlines<00:05:37.770> put<00:05:38.770> on<00:05:38.889> this

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
there's a little outlines put on this

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.779 
there's a little outlines put on this
one<00:05:39.340> too

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:56.110 

the<00:05:47.880> go<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.270> they're<00:05:48.389> still<00:05:48.630> backing<00:05:48.870> on

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.909

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
using transfer tape to layer remember

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.780 
using transfer tape to layer remember
it's<00:06:01.490> really<00:06:01.580> thin<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.260> it's<00:06:03.889> very<00:06:04.280> sticky<00:06:04.550> it

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
it's really thin and it's very sticky it

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.900 
it's really thin and it's very sticky it
sticks<00:06:05.060> to<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.360> another<00:06:06.350> piece<00:06:06.590> of<00:06:06.740> vinyl<00:06:06.910> very
