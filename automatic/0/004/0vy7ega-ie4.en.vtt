people<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> understand<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> an

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
people to understand that this is an

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
people to understand that this is an
airplane<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.100> people<00:01:05.909> who<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.060> currently

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
airplane that people who are currently

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
airplane that people who are currently
flying<00:01:06.689> smaller<00:01:07.140> airplanes<00:01:07.650> ought<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.340> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
flying smaller airplanes ought to be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.600 
flying smaller airplanes ought to be
able<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> aspire<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> often<00:01:11.100> put<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
able to aspire to the way I often put it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
able to aspire to the way I often put it
is<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.970> airplane<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.479> easy<00:01:12.689> enough<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.020> me

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is an airplane that's easy enough for me

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.219 
is an airplane that's easy enough for me
to<00:01:13.380> fly<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.159> flew<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:14.939> sr22

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to fly and I flew out here in my sr22

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.289 
to fly and I flew out here in my sr22
so<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> concept<00:01:17.189> behind<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.580> jet<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so the concept behind the jet as a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.899 
so the concept behind the jet as a

into<00:01:48.900> flight<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.440> should<00:01:49.710> happen<00:01:50.040> sometime

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
into flight which should happen sometime

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
into flight which should happen sometime
next<00:01:50.730> year<00:01:51.080> some<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.230> things<00:01:52.410> that<00:01:52.500> make

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
next year some of the things that make

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.430 
next year some of the things that make
our<00:01:52.980> personal<00:01:53.880> jet<00:01:54.150> different<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:54.870> the

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
our personal jet different is the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.340 
our personal jet different is the
seating<00:01:55.800> configuration<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.270> five<00:01:58.080> seed

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
seating configuration it's a five seed

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.610 
seating configuration it's a five seed
airplane<00:01:58.800> with<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.760> pilot<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.390> front<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.470> one

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
airplane with the pilot up front but one

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.930 
airplane with the pilot up front but one
of<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> unique<00:02:02.070> features<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
of the unique features is that this

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.880 
of the unique features is that this
middle<00:02:03.270> seat<00:02:03.480> slides<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.260> what<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.440> does<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
middle seat slides and what that does is

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.560 
middle seat slides and what that does is
allow<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.369> offset<00:02:08.880> your<00:02:09.030> shoulders

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
allow you to offset your shoulders

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.500 
allow you to offset your shoulders
giving<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.170> much<00:02:10.440> more<00:02:10.740> spacious<00:02:11.400> feeling<00:02:11.700> for

giving a much more spacious feeling for

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.540 
giving a much more spacious feeling for
the<00:02:12.930> primary<00:02:13.380> five<00:02:13.680> seasons<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.280> you'll<00:02:14.430> also

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
the primary five seasons but you'll also

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.250 
the primary five seasons but you'll also
notice<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.030> behind<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.720> in

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
notice this behind that we have in

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.410 
notice this behind that we have in

obviously<00:02:30.090> looks<00:02:30.360> different<00:02:31.050> from<00:02:31.290> what<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
obviously looks different from what a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.610 
obviously looks different from what a
lot<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.550> jets<00:02:32.850> look<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.300> currently<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:34.410> think

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
lot of jets look like currently we think

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 
lot of jets look like currently we think
more<00:02:34.770> will<00:02:34.950> look<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.610> future<00:02:35.760> as

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
more will look this way in the future as
