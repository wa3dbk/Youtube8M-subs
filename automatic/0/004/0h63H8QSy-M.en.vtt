you about the kind of finish we can get
with<00:00:25.230> RAAM<00:00:25.619> EDM<00:00:26.420> first<00:00:27.420> there's<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.750> rough<00:00:28.080> cut

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
with RAAM EDM first there's a rough cut

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.790 
with RAAM EDM first there's a rough cut
and<00:00:28.849> then<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> finish<00:00:30.599> cut<00:00:30.869> let's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and then there is a finish cut let's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
and then there is a finish cut let's
take<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> look<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> video<00:00:33.000> where<00:00:33.239> we'll<00:00:33.390> be

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
take a look at this video where we'll be

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.790 
take a look at this video where we'll be
seeing<00:00:33.840> rough<00:00:34.320> cutting<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.980> finish<00:00:35.850> cutting

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
seeing rough cutting and finish cutting

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
seeing rough cutting and finish cutting
notice<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> video<00:00:38.340> first<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.090> rough<00:00:39.360> cut

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
notice on the video first that rough cut

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
notice on the video first that rough cut
you<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> sparks<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> fumes

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you see the sparks you see the fumes

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.410 
you see the sparks you see the fumes
coming<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> cut<00:00:44.030> now<00:00:45.030> look<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
coming out of the cut now look at the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.500 
coming out of the cut now look at the
finishing<00:00:45.719> cut<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.250> hardly<00:00:47.850> any<00:00:47.940> fumes

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
finishing cut you see hardly any fumes

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.279 
finishing cut you see hardly any fumes
coming<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:50.030> now<00:00:51.030> I'd<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> show<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.899> what

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
coming out now I'd like to show you what

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
coming out now I'd like to show you what
happens<00:00:52.829> inside<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.610> cut<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.660> rough<00:00:57.870> cut

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
happens inside the cut in a rough cut

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.529 
happens inside the cut in a rough cut
there's<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> energy<00:00:59.489> applied<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
there's a lot of energy applied to the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
there's a lot of energy applied to the
electrode<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> sparks<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.550> large<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
electrode so the sparks are large and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
electrode so the sparks are large and
the<00:01:03.510> cavities<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.229> large

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the cavities are large

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.149 
the cavities are large
likewise<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:06.270> finishing<00:01:06.630> cut<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.650> sparks

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
likewise and a finishing cut the sparks

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.880 
likewise and a finishing cut the sparks
are<00:01:08.340> very<00:01:08.640> small<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.320> these<00:01:10.530> cavities

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
are very small and so these cavities

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
are very small and so these cavities
becomes<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.820> small<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.900> quite<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
becomes very small and we can do quite a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.469 
becomes very small and we can do quite a
number<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.590> finishing<00:01:14.100> cuts<00:01:14.310> depending<00:01:14.790> how

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
number of finishing cuts depending how

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.350 
number of finishing cuts depending how
what<00:01:15.780> kind<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.049> finish<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> have

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this machine will go into our X orbit

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
this machine will go into our X orbit
they'll<00:01:24.060> actually<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> each<00:01:24.960> side<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
they'll actually go on each side of the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.920 
they'll actually go on each side of the
flat

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.460 

notice<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.980> this<00:01:37.070> finishing<00:01:37.670> cut<00:01:38.050> as<00:01:39.050> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
notice in this finishing cut as the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.160 
notice in this finishing cut as the
electro<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.040> going<00:01:40.370> into<00:01:40.580> Tech's<00:01:40.910> orbit<00:01:41.480> and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
electro is going into Tech's orbit and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.250 
electro is going into Tech's orbit and
it's<00:01:42.380> cutting<00:01:42.650> notice<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.400> sides<00:01:43.670> now

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's cutting notice the sides now

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.460 
it's cutting notice the sides now
there's<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:45.380> lot<00:01:45.620> less<00:01:45.890> debris<00:01:46.370> in<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:47.120> oil

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
there's a lot less debris in the oil

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.740 
there's a lot less debris in the oil
because<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.800> sparks<00:01:49.310> are<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:49.610> small<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.660> if

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
because of the sparks are so small so if

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.380 
because of the sparks are so small so if
you're<00:01:50.900> removing<00:01:51.200> very<00:01:51.740> little<00:01:52.190> material

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.680 

notice<00:01:59.260> because<00:01:59.470> it's<00:01:59.950> orbiting<00:02:00.690> the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
notice because it's orbiting the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.500 
notice because it's orbiting the
electrode<00:02:02.260> is<00:02:02.440> always<00:02:02.860> made<00:02:03.160> smaller<00:02:03.820> and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
electrode is always made smaller and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.050 
electrode is always made smaller and
that<00:02:05.290> depends<00:02:05.680> how<00:02:05.860> far<00:02:06.340> out<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.760> want<00:02:06.970> to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
that depends how far out you want to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.260 
that depends how far out you want to
orbit<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:08.619> done<00:02:09.310> by<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.610> programmer

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
orbit and that's done by the programmer

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.470 
orbit and that's done by the programmer
when<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.320> makes<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.620> electrode<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.180> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
when it makes the electrode and so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.140 
when it makes the electrode and so
because<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.550> orbiting<00:02:15.550> as<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:15.970> see

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
because of the orbiting as you can see

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150 
because of the orbiting as you can see
going<00:02:16.450> into<00:02:16.780> these<00:02:16.900> flats<00:02:17.260> over<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.740> this<00:02:17.890> hex

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
going into these flats over in this hex

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.480 
going into these flats over in this hex
orbit<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:19.600> electrode<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.620> orbiting<00:02:21.310> out

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
orbit the electrode now is orbiting out

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
orbit the electrode now is orbiting out
so<00:02:21.700> making<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.120> cavity<00:02:22.600> larger<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
so making a cavity larger this is a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.930 
so making a cavity larger this is a
sample<00:02:26.020> piece<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.440> had<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.920> machine<00:02:27.280> doing

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
sample piece we had in the machine doing

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.690 
sample piece we had in the machine doing
a<00:02:28.120> roughing<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.870> finishing<00:02:29.170> cut<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:30.430> take

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
a roughing and a finishing cut just take

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.650 
a roughing and a finishing cut just take
a<00:02:30.730> look<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.209> fine<00:02:31.540> finish<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.440> piece

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.229 

there<00:02:37.660> are<00:02:37.870> two<00:02:38.080> cycles<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.800> RAM<00:02:39.070> EDM<00:02:39.580> there's

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
there are two cycles and RAM EDM there's

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.680 
there are two cycles and RAM EDM there's
the<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.630> time<00:02:41.020> when<00:02:41.410> many<00:02:42.070> sparks<00:02:42.610> occur<00:02:42.940> but

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
the on time when many sparks occur but

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.440 
the on time when many sparks occur but
between<00:02:44.080> every<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.739> time<00:02:45.070> there's<00:02:45.820> also<00:02:46.180> an

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
between every on time there's also an

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.990 
between every on time there's also an
off<00:02:46.690> time<00:02:47.020> let's<00:02:47.950> look<00:02:48.070> at<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> diagram<00:02:48.640> now

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
off time let's look at this diagram now

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.740 
off time let's look at this diagram now
and<00:02:49.510> see<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.410> happens<00:02:50.860> during<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.400> off<00:02:51.640> time

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and see what happens during the off time

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.510 
and see what happens during the off time
in<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:52.930> diagram<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:53.650> see<00:02:53.680> controlled

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
in this diagram we see controlled

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.199 
in this diagram we see controlled
erosion<00:02:55.270> takes<00:02:55.570> place<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> workpiece<00:02:56.739> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
erosion takes place in the workpiece and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.180 
erosion takes place in the workpiece and
here<00:02:58.209> we<00:02:58.360> see<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.720> dielectric<00:02:59.440> oil<00:02:59.770> during

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
here we see the dielectric oil during

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.970 
here we see the dielectric oil during
the<00:03:00.340> off<00:03:00.610> time<00:03:01.140> cools<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.470> vaporized

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the off time cools the vaporized

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.490 
the off time cools the vaporized
material<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> off<00:03:04.269> time<00:03:04.570> you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
material so this is the off time you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.610 
material so this is the off time you
have<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.040> get<00:03:06.220> rid<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.459> these<00:03:06.580> chips<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
have to get rid of these chips and the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.340 
have to get rid of these chips and the
pressurized<00:03:09.220> dielectric<00:03:10.060> oil<00:03:10.360> removes<00:03:11.049> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
pressurized dielectric oil removes the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.520 
pressurized dielectric oil removes the
evm<00:03:11.830> chips<00:03:12.250> then<00:03:12.519> we<00:03:12.640> show<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.000> from<00:03:13.299> here<00:03:13.660> now

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
evm chips then we show it from here now

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.920 
evm chips then we show it from here now
there's<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.830> number<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.190> ways<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.820> removing<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
there's a number of ways of removing the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.150 
there's a number of ways of removing the
chips<00:03:17.230> here<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:19.410> electrode<00:03:20.410> moving<00:03:20.830> up<00:03:21.010> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
chips here the electrode moving up and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.340 
chips here the electrode moving up and
down<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:22.120> pecking<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> electrode

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
down this pecking of the electrode

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.000 
down this pecking of the electrode
creates<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.400> pumping<00:03:24.790> action<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.200> old<00:03:26.440> EDM

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
creates a pumping action and the old EDM

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.860 
creates a pumping action and the old EDM
machines<00:03:27.430> they<00:03:27.610> used<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.880> put<00:03:28.030> holes<00:03:28.299> into<00:03:28.660> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
machines they used to put holes into the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.160 
machines they used to put holes into the
electrodes<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.560> angles<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:31.060> assist<00:03:31.930> in

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
electrodes on angles to assist in

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.080 
electrodes on angles to assist in
flushing<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.070> new<00:03:33.220> machines<00:03:33.700> not<00:03:33.940> with

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
flushing but the new machines not with

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.110 
flushing but the new machines not with
their<00:03:34.269> pecking<00:03:34.870> abilities<00:03:35.519> we<00:03:36.519> find<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.000> we

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
their pecking abilities we find that we

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.060 
their pecking abilities we find that we
don't<00:03:37.269> need<00:03:37.480> many<00:03:37.780> holes<00:03:38.049> but<00:03:38.290> still<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.680> hole

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
don't need many holes but still a hole

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.180 
don't need many holes but still a hole
in<00:03:39.310> electrode<00:03:39.820> does<00:03:40.570> help<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.380> I'd<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.040> to

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
in electrode does help and I'd like to

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
in electrode does help and I'd like to
show<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.670> one<00:03:42.850> video<00:03:43.120> where<00:03:43.570> we<00:03:44.230> are

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
show you this one video where we are

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.860 
show you this one video where we are
cutting<00:03:44.560> horizontally<00:03:45.459> with<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.360> hex

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
cutting horizontally with a hex

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.110 
cutting horizontally with a hex
electrode<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.709> you'll<00:03:48.280> find<00:03:48.549> there's<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.820> hole

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
electrode and you'll find there's a hole

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.820 
electrode and you'll find there's a hole
in<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.450> electrode<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.140> like<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.410> one<00:03:50.650> has

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
in the electrode just like this one has

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.490 
in the electrode just like this one has
a<00:03:50.860> hole<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.450> will<00:03:52.660> assist<00:03:53.049> now

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
a hole in it and that will assist now

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.330 
a hole in it and that will assist now
you<00:03:53.560> don't<00:03:53.769> need<00:03:53.980> it

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
you don't need it

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.670 
you don't need it
but<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.299> more<00:03:55.450> efficient<00:03:55.930> if<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.230> do<00:03:56.440> have

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
but it's more efficient if you do have

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.210 
but it's more efficient if you do have
it<00:03:56.860> let's<00:03:57.400> look<00:03:57.610> at<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.880> video<00:03:58.829> as<00:03:59.829> you<00:04:00.040> can

it let's look at this video as you can

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.090 
it let's look at this video as you can
see<00:04:00.400> over<00:04:00.519> here<00:04:00.730> all<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.420> coming<00:04:01.660> through

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
see over here all is coming through

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.290 
see over here all is coming through
reelect<00:04:03.100> road

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
reelect road

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.320 
reelect road
and<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.600> helps<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.770> removing<00:04:06.460> the<00:04:06.640> rated

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
and that helps and removing the rated

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.590 
and that helps and removing the rated
particles<00:04:07.950> whereas<00:04:08.950> it's<00:04:09.130> easy<00:04:09.340> yummy<00:04:09.600> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
particles whereas it's easy yummy and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.680 
particles whereas it's easy yummy and
when<00:04:11.410> this<00:04:11.560> tank<00:04:11.800> fills<00:04:12.160> up<00:04:12.370> over<00:04:12.700> here<00:04:12.880> this

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
when this tank fills up over here this

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.390 
when this tank fills up over here this
will<00:04:13.900> resume<00:04:14.260> cutting<00:04:14.740> as<00:04:14.890> you<00:04:14.980> can<00:04:15.130> see<00:04:15.250> these

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
will resume cutting as you can see these

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.040 
will resume cutting as you can see these
two<00:04:15.640> have<00:04:15.760> done<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.540> we're<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.900> be

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
two have done and we're going to be

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.600 
two have done and we're going to be
putting<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.560> third<00:04:17.800> hacks<00:04:18.130> into<00:04:18.790> this<00:04:19.150> piece

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
putting the third hacks into this piece

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.260 
putting the third hacks into this piece
now<00:04:21.610> the<00:04:21.670> tank<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.450> being<00:04:22.750> filled<00:04:23.170> with<00:04:23.440> oil

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
now the tank is being filled with oil

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.320 
now the tank is being filled with oil
and<00:04:25.270> once<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.990> reaches<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.590> proper<00:04:27.010> place<00:04:27.340> it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
and once it reaches the proper place it

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.120 
and once it reaches the proper place it
will<00:04:28.570> resume<00:04:28.990> EDM<00:04:29.650> in<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> hex<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:32.680> might<00:04:32.920> not

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
will resume EDM in the hex you might not

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240 
will resume EDM in the hex you might not
see<00:04:33.430> this<00:04:33.670> but<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.780> machine<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.200> pecking<00:04:36.040> this

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
see this but the machine is pecking this

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.350 
see this but the machine is pecking this
hex<00:04:36.580> into<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.240> part<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:38.790> here<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:39.970> see<00:04:40.180> the

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
hex into the part and here we see the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.840

these diagrams we have dielectric oil
but<00:04:50.530> there's<00:04:50.710> an<00:04:50.830> important<00:04:51.370> thing<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.610> want<00:04:51.640> to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
but there's an important thing I want to

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.640 
but there's an important thing I want to
speak<00:04:52.180> about<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.740> flash<00:04:54.490> point<00:04:55.650> this

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
speak about and that is flash point this

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.710 
speak about and that is flash point this
oil<00:04:57.210> will<00:04:58.210> burn<00:04:58.720> ignite<00:04:59.440> into<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.400> fire<00:05:00.720> and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
oil will burn ignite into a fire and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.150 
oil will burn ignite into a fire and
we've<00:05:01.960> had<00:05:02.170> it<00:05:02.200> done<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.500> our<00:05:02.770> machines

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
we've had it done on our machines

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.460 
we've had it done on our machines
already<00:05:03.340> we<00:05:03.610> have<00:05:03.820> fire<00:05:04.180> extinguishers<00:05:04.470> on

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
already we have fire extinguishers on

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.680 
already we have fire extinguishers on
our<00:05:05.710> machines<00:05:06.130> if<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.490> happens<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.480> will

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
our machines if that happens it will

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.560 
our machines if that happens it will
quench<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.440> fire<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.340> they<00:05:09.970> recommend<00:05:10.510> the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
quench that fire and they recommend the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.040 
quench that fire and they recommend the
oil<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:11.050> be<00:05:11.200> under<00:05:11.710> 165<00:05:12.700> degrees<00:05:13.120> or<00:05:13.450> 74

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
oil to be under 165 degrees or 74

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.430 
oil to be under 165 degrees or 74
degrees<00:05:14.460> centigrade<00:05:15.460> if<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.570> gets<00:05:16.780> too<00:05:16.990> hot<00:05:17.200> it

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
degrees centigrade if it gets too hot it

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.700 
degrees centigrade if it gets too hot it
will<00:05:17.620> automatically<00:05:18.430> burn<00:05:18.990> now<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.170> spark

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
will automatically burn now that spark

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.820 
will automatically burn now that spark
that<00:05:21.430> occurs<00:05:21.730> in<00:05:21.910> here<00:05:22.230> they<00:05:23.230> say<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.650> goes<00:05:23.770> up

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
that occurs in here they say it goes up

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.160 
that occurs in here they say it goes up
to<00:05:24.930> 14,500<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:27.300> 22,000<00:05:28.300> degrees<00:05:28.570> Fahrenheit

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
to 14,500 to 22,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.160 
to 14,500 to 22,000 degrees Fahrenheit
or<00:05:29.790> 8,000<00:05:30.790> degrees<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.420> 12,000<00:05:32.080> degrees

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
or 8,000 degrees to 12,000 degrees

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.890 
or 8,000 degrees to 12,000 degrees
centigrade<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.760> gets<00:05:33.910> tremendously<00:05:34.570> hot

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
centigrade so it gets tremendously hot

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.980 
centigrade so it gets tremendously hot
that<00:05:35.170> oil<00:05:35.380> and<00:05:35.710> so<00:05:36.670> that's<00:05:36.910> why<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.240> chiller<00:05:37.780> is

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
that oil and so that's why a chiller is

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.370 
that oil and so that's why a chiller is
used<00:05:38.520> always<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.940> keep<00:05:40.480> that<00:05:40.750> oil<00:05:40.900> at<00:05:41.260> a

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
used always to keep that oil at a

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.070 
used always to keep that oil at a
constant<00:05:41.830> temperature<00:05:42.540> I'd<00:05:43.540> like<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.840> speak

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
constant temperature I'd like to speak

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.470 
constant temperature I'd like to speak
to<00:05:44.260> you<00:05:44.350> about<00:05:44.440> a<00:05:44.590> problem<00:05:45.070> we<00:05:45.220> had<00:05:45.460> in<00:05:46.000> the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
to you about a problem we had in the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.890 
to you about a problem we had in the
series<00:05:46.720> graphite<00:05:47.710> electrodes<00:05:48.480> we<00:05:49.480> have<00:05:49.870> a

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
series graphite electrodes we have a

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.960 
series graphite electrodes we have a
bandsaw<00:05:50.470> where<00:05:50.710> we<00:05:50.800> cut<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:51.160> graphite<00:05:51.610> will

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
bandsaw where we cut the graphite will

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.850 
bandsaw where we cut the graphite will
also<00:05:52.180> have<00:05:52.300> milling<00:05:52.660> machines<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.440> there<00:05:53.650> and

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
also have milling machines and there and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.370 
also have milling machines and there and
then<00:05:54.610> close<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.540> we<00:05:55.630> have<00:05:55.660> an<00:05:55.990> air<00:05:56.169> filtration

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
then close and we have an air filtration

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.159 
then close and we have an air filtration
system<00:05:57.310> we<00:05:57.520> also<00:05:57.669> have<00:05:57.940> an<00:05:58.090> air<00:05:58.630> filtration

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
system we also have an air filtration

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.820 
system we also have an air filtration
system<00:06:00.010> when<00:06:00.190> we<00:06:00.340> cut<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:01.180> graphite<00:06:01.660> yet<00:06:02.620> in

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
system when we cut the graphite yet in

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.909 
system when we cut the graphite yet in
spite<00:06:03.040> of<00:06:03.220> that<00:06:03.370> we<00:06:03.730> had<00:06:04.540> graphite<00:06:05.140> dust<00:06:05.410> even

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
spite of that we had graphite dust even

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.190 
spite of that we had graphite dust even
in<00:06:06.040> our<00:06:06.160> kitchen<00:06:06.640> and<00:06:06.940> it<00:06:07.330> also<00:06:07.480> was<00:06:07.750> all<00:06:07.930> over

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
in our kitchen and it also was all over

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.860 
in our kitchen and it also was all over
the<00:06:08.290> shop<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:09.490> way<00:06:09.640> we<00:06:09.850> solve<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.300> problem<00:06:10.720> we

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
the shop the way we solve the problem we

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.930 
the shop the way we solve the problem we
built<00:06:11.140> another<00:06:11.260> building<00:06:11.890> and<00:06:12.070> put<00:06:12.760> all<00:06:12.910> our

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
built another building and put all our

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.300 
built another building and put all our
