00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 I swear that I swear to you that in 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.550
 Any time you will let me go 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.230
 crying no no no no no no 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.390
 horrible horrible horrible is so 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.470
 horrible that I could cry all my life 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.350
 For this 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.250
 pretend that I do not know if many 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.500
 know but from February 14 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 was the open beta of dayton fault 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.550
 for the xbox one and for the pc then 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.860
 pretend that my serious brother who 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.670
 I already told you but I have the xbox 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.019
 Then, obviously, I could 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.030
 have had the opportunity to try the 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.650
 beta of tight end and prove how good 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 game was because many are 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.559
 recommending but for questions 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 curious of the universe how it works 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.759
 this curious universe 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.939
 mini damn modem stopped working it 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.189
 died stopped transmitting this picture of 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.719
 your internet then you can not even 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.399
 even connect to the internet I could not 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.399
 do homework on the internet and the worst of 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.530
 all I could not download the damn beta 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.950
 of fucking tight end fall until barely 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.259
 today, Thursday , February 20 , your internet 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.409
 again and guess when the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.490
 solid beta or if on February 19 a 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.490
 goodbye egg 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.549
 then planet I had a jet of 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.600
 The desire of football is to prove that vein 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.610
 too much desire I had to try 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.570
 try the beta to see how is that 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.380
 because mint looks pretty 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.549
 promising then well then I want 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.649
 ask you if you had the 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.929
 opportunity to prove that stage that I 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.000
 Say if you think it's a game 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.159
 recommended is not the chance and then 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.439
 I get it when it comes out I think it's the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.810
 March 12 on March 12 in the game 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.640
 so then maybe chance and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.259
 lorente to see how it is there at 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.909
 better I finish it buying everything depends 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.069
 of the circumstances that such is the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.780
 game what if I wanted to buy it or if 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.940
 no, I was going to decide with the beta 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.200
 but I did not have an opportunity to evacuate 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.480
 to the beta so he calls chick in 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.730
 that aspect 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.709
 but good good good 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.620
 by the way is the reason why no 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.970
 I uploaded video last Saturday is not because 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.519
 I have died in that because I have 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.890
 gone from binge simply plainly 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.870
 it's because he does not have internet or 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.670
 horrible was a horrible week of no 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.890
 have had internet and can not 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.959
 wasting my life on the computer and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.170
 in the xbox that football that would accept by 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.720
 the love of audouin 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.890
 but we're here with a little bit 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 of ice four I think it's a team swat 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.450
 in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.110
 a map where they impart four disuse and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.480
 sure then I hope you like it 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.860
 seconds a gameplay are not new much 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.840
 that I do not actually play home part of 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.000
 a game was a little bit stuck 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.370
 quite at school is going to me 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.520
 the fuck but I'm taking all my 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.110
 time there then then I have not played 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.660
 nothing new I do not like 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.750
 absolutely nothing since about two 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.030
 weeks not 23 weeks I have not played anything 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 nothing nothing nothing nothing 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.530
 and well I'm not sure I think until the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.480
 next week I will have a chance to 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.090
 play again because I have some 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.770
 exams next week then the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.540
 I'm going to try to make you feel like that 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.190
 because if I can not speak mother and not 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.090
 I think it's worth a little 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.209
 so 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.440
 Well, I wanted to tell you that in 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.550
 last video I told them I wanted to 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.099
 get the metal bucket gear rising 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.379
 revenge cns and it turns out that what 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.730
 we get then the idea is nothing more 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.390
 re-record this 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.390
 the game 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.200
 I wondered if like facebook 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.310
 they wanted to see if they wanted to continue seeing 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.740
 the campaign that I'm obviously going to 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.720
 continue but I asked if they wanted to see it 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.570
 the campaign from the beginning or from 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.920
 zero or simply continuous since 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.910
 let her 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.069
 basically it would be in chapter 4 if 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.100
 bad I do not remember I finished the 3 to be 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.480
 starting in chapter 4 I played it 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.609
 chapter 4 the truth I'm not going to 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.590
 say I did not record it but I had an error 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.320
 with the audio this at the time of recording 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.760
 I got stuck the sony vegas that we 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.530
 is recording the audio I ruled it by 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.570
 have it recorded here then then 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.460
 the return the entire file is 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.530
 corrupted then it did not help at all 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.530
 then the idea is to play it again 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.050
 Well, that's what I wanted to comment on 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.640
 that he had asked how they wanted it 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.510
 see and they had told me that the 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.770
 audience from the beginning commented that 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.070
 it will continue from where it had 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.870
 left 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.090
 then opinions were 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.610
 pretty divided and sorry for not 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.140
 ask you guys but that's why 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.490
 the always say that like the page 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.540
 of facebook because there are advertisements 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.340
 things that happen 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.110
 except the fact that I'm left without 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.540
 internet because like fuck 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.640
 warn that I ran out of internet in a 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.990
 page that used internet obviously 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.630
 so then ok ok nonsense 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.120
 so then in the campaign and metal that 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.730
 racing I will continue as soon as 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.600
 finish the exam I will try to 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.340
 dedicate myself to record the campaign and I'm going 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.840
 to give some other gameplays of 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.310
 here of four from some other game 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.140
 then I hope that 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:37.020
 Enjoy it and I do not think so 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.310
 I have much more than that the truth that 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.060
 I'm crying because it was not the 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.440
 damn tyrone vein so if the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.910
 crisis had the opportunity to 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.560
 Try them tell me how good is 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.450
 is because I swear that I had 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.210
 too many too much desire 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.400
 to play that time 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.780
 then I hope that the video has them 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.550
 liked to be a little short I think 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.550
 that nothing else is about five minutes six 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.640
 maximum minutes 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.670
 then I commented that I like to subscribe 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.110
 and see you in the next video that 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.700
 I hope it is soon and not to be left without 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.700
 internet because I fucked again
