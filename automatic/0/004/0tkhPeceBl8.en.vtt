00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
boxes you've ever seen the next step

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
boxes you've ever seen the next step
then<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> create<00:00:18.480> some<00:00:18.720> pillars<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.410> that

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
then is to create some pillars and that

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.870 
then is to create some pillars and that
are<00:00:19.920> hopefully<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> look<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.699> bit

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
are hopefully going to look a little bit

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
are hopefully going to look a little bit
like<00:00:20.939> they're<00:00:21.150> holding<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> ceiling<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
like they're holding the ceiling of the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
like they're holding the ceiling of the
room<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:24.869> thing<00:00:24.990> we're<00:00:25.109> going

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
room up so the first thing we're going

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.950 
room up so the first thing we're going
to<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.830> reset<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> home<00:00:26.640> view<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to do is just reset the home view so

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
to do is just reset the home view so
that<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.949> back<00:00:29.130> wall<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
that your back wall is going to be the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.250 
that your back wall is going to be the
same<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.330> back<00:00:30.570> wall<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:33.260> little

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
same as my back wall so that the little

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.060 
same as my back wall so that the little
treat<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.500> we're<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.040> create

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
treat that we're going to do to create

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
treat that we're going to do to create
copies<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> pillars<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.829> work

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
copies of one of the pillars will work

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
copies of one of the pillars will work
as<00:00:38.340> expected<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:39.899> we're<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
as expected so what we're going to do is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.119 
as expected so what we're going to do is
create<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:42.050> cube<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.530> I'm<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> click

create a cube so I'm just going to click

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.510 
create a cube so I'm just going to click
on<00:00:44.160> Q<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> shelf<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:46.500> gonna<00:00:46.739> create<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
on Q from the shelf I'm gonna create the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.830 
on Q from the shelf I'm gonna create the
base<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.420> sort<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> rectangular<00:00:50.840> like

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
base to be a sort of rectangular like

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.479 
base to be a sort of rectangular like
that<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.410> I'm<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.829> pull<00:00:53.309> that

and then I'm gonna move into the back

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.950 
and then I'm gonna move into the back
corner<00:01:10.030> like<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:12.610> okay<00:01:13.610> now<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.600> just<00:01:14.780> make

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
corner like that okay now to just make

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.010 
corner like that okay now to just make
it<00:01:15.170> look<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.619> little<00:01:16.040> bit<00:01:16.340> more<00:01:17.020> architectural

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
it look a little bit more architectural

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.380 
it look a little bit more architectural
II<00:01:18.229> interesting<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.220> gonna<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:20.240> add<00:01:20.360> a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
II interesting I'm gonna just add a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.450 
II interesting I'm gonna just add a
little<00:01:20.570> bit<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.900> rotate<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:24.040> like<00:01:25.040> that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
little bit of a rotate to it like that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.520 
little bit of a rotate to it like that
so<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:26.030> inside<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.600> room<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.140> should<00:01:27.170> just

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
so that inside the room you should just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.969 
so that inside the room you should just
look<00:01:27.619> like<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.990> okay<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.229> that's<00:01:30.710> what<00:01:30.860> we're

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
look like that okay so that's what we're

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.160 
look like that okay so that's what we're
going<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.610> kind<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.909> effect<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.020> if<00:01:33.080> you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
going for that kind of effect so if you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.740 
going for that kind of effect so if you
reset<00:01:33.590> your<00:01:33.680> home<00:01:33.860> view<00:01:34.100> at<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.399> point<00:01:34.750> you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
reset your home view at this point you

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.999 
reset your home view at this point you
should<00:01:35.780> have<00:01:38.200> your<00:01:39.200> pillar<00:01:39.470> just<00:01:40.280> about<00:01:40.550> there

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
should have your pillar just about there

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.730 
should have your pillar just about there
so<00:01:43.009> what<00:01:43.369> we<00:01:43.460> need<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.610> do<00:01:43.789> next<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:45.530> create

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
so what we need to do next is to create

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.290 
so what we need to do next is to create
some<00:01:45.890> copies<00:01:46.190> of<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.369> shape<00:01:46.610> along<00:01:47.090> this

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
some copies of that shape along this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.309 
some copies of that shape along this
wall<00:01:47.649> which<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:49.240> nice<00:01:50.240> needs<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.780> do<00:01:50.929> so<00:01:51.200> we're

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
wall which is nice needs to do so we're

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.070 
wall which is nice needs to do so we're
going<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.470> make<00:01:51.590> sure<00:01:51.800> I've<00:01:51.890> got<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.100> selected

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
going to make sure I've got it selected

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.100 
going to make sure I've got it selected

to add a value to every single

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.500 
to add a value to every single
duplication<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.700> each<00:02:31.820> copy<00:02:32.060> I'm<00:02:32.269> going<00:02:32.450> to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
duplication to each copy I'm going to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.780 
duplication to each copy I'm going to
add<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.660> new<00:02:32.840> value<00:02:33.079> and<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.579> be

add a new value and that is going to be

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.349 
add a new value and that is going to be
this<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.720> move<00:02:36.010> five<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.579> x<00:02:37.730> axis<00:02:37.910> so

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
this going to move five on the x axis so

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.960 
this going to move five on the x axis so
translate<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.380> how<00:02:39.500> we<00:02:39.560> move<00:02:39.799> things<00:02:40.070> these

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
translate is how we move things these

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.060 
translate is how we move things these
boxes<00:02:41.510> always<00:02:42.049> go<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.350> alphabetical<00:02:42.470> order<00:02:42.859> so

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
boxes always go in alphabetical order so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.810 
boxes always go in alphabetical order so
it's<00:02:43.190> X<00:02:43.430> Y<00:02:44.060> Z<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.320> x<00:02:45.440> axis<00:02:45.609> I'm<00:02:46.609> going<00:02:46.760> to

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
it's X Y Z so on the x axis I'm going to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.140 
it's X Y Z so on the x axis I'm going to
change<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.269> number<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.630> five<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.880> then<00:02:50.060> when

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
change that number to five and then when

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.040 
change that number to five and then when
