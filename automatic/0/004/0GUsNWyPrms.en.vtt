00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
class so you know that's definitely

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
class so you know that's definitely
going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> hurt<00:00:33.000> us<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.390> bit<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.020> feel

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
going to hurt us a little bit but I feel

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380 
going to hurt us a little bit but I feel
like<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> perk<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.370> extra<00:00:35.880> perk<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> going

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
like the perk or the extra perk is going

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
like the perk or the extra perk is going
to<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.770> guess<00:00:38.070> more<00:00:38.280> important<00:00:38.610> but

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
to be very I guess more important but

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
to be very I guess more important but
you<00:00:38.760> could<00:00:38.910> always<00:00:39.059> put<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.780> RW<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you could always put on the RW one and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.260 
you could always put on the RW one and
take<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.890> peripherals<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.850> were<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> do

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
take off peripherals if you were to do

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
take off peripherals if you were to do
so<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.350> first<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.800> put<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.980> flak

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so the first of all we can put on flak

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
so the first of all we can put on flak
jacket<00:00:44.550> since<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> a

a headshot you basically get the kill
even<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.369> how

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
even one you know so you know how

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.110 
even one you know so you know how
this<00:01:29.350> gun<00:01:29.560> doesn't<00:01:29.770> really<00:01:30.040> have<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.280> best<00:01:30.940> of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
this gun doesn't really have the best of

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.550 
this gun doesn't really have the best of
damage<00:01:31.510> and<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.690> wouldn't<00:01:31.930> recommend<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.440> you

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
damage and I wouldn't recommend it you

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.630 
damage and I wouldn't recommend it you
know<00:01:32.680> something<00:01:32.980> like<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.220> bowel<00:01:33.400> is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
know something like the bowel is

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.760 
know something like the bowel is
definitely<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> whole<00:01:34.630> lot<00:01:34.810> better<00:01:34.840> but<00:01:35.620> if<00:01:35.710> you

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
definitely a whole lot better but if you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.290 
definitely a whole lot better but if you
guys<00:01:35.860> are<00:01:36.070> looking<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.820> use<00:01:36.970> something<00:01:37.180> a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
guys are looking to use something a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.730 
guys are looking to use something a
little<00:01:37.390> bit<00:01:37.540> more<00:01:37.660> challenging<00:01:37.900> I<00:01:38.410> definitely

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
little bit more challenging I definitely

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.400 
little bit more challenging I definitely
assume<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.240> are<00:01:40.450> looking<00:01:40.900> at<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.050> video<00:01:41.320> to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
assume you are looking at this video to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.890 
assume you are looking at this video to
use<00:01:41.980> a<00:01:42.160> RX<00:01:42.610> which<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.120> a<00:01:43.330> little<00:01:43.660> bit<00:01:43.810> more

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
use a RX which is a little bit more

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.270 
use a RX which is a little bit more
challenging<00:01:44.080> than<00:01:44.560> most<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:45.010> these<00:01:45.070> sell

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
challenging than most of these sell

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.030 
challenging than most of these sell
rifles<00:01:45.610> maybe<00:01:46.390> not<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.930> challenging<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.710> but

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
rifles maybe not the challenging is but

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.610 
rifles maybe not the challenging is but
it's<00:01:48.400> definitely<00:01:48.760> challenging<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.570> anyway<00:01:50.410> if

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
it's definitely challenging so anyway if

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.080 
it's definitely challenging so anyway if
