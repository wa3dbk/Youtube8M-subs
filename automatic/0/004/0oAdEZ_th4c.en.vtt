at<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> bio<00:01:12.479> cube<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> saw<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> filtration

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
at a bio cube and you saw the filtration

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.080 
at a bio cube and you saw the filtration
well<00:01:15.360> obviously<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.710> works<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> ever<00:01:17.939> see

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
well obviously it works if you ever see

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.830 
well obviously it works if you ever see
a<00:01:18.119> bio<00:01:18.360> cube<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.670> spss<00:01:20.670> quarrel<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.390> mice

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a bio cube that has spss quarrel at mice

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.070 
a bio cube that has spss quarrel at mice
using<00:01:22.049> SPS<00:01:22.650> corals<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:24.770> whatnot<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
using SPS corals and whatnot this is the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.249 
using SPS corals and whatnot this is the
skimmer<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.680> skimmer<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.850> tank<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
skimmer the skimmer in the tank and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
skimmer the skimmer in the tank and
obviously<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.130> has<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.520> work<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.939> keep<00:01:33.060> those

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
obviously it has to work to keep those

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.749 
obviously it has to work to keep those
delicate<00:01:33.750> corals<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.829> even<00:01:35.009> keep<00:01:35.280> clams

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
delicate corals you can even keep clams

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.160 
delicate corals you can even keep clams
and<00:01:36.329> anemones<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.290> there<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:39.020> does<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and anemones in there so does the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
and anemones in there so does the
skimmer<00:01:40.409> work<00:01:40.680> look<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.579> yourself<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.689> not

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
skimmer work look for yourself it's not

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
skimmer work look for yourself it's not
efficient<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> c-clone<00:01:46.670> octopuses<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
efficient as a c-clone octopuses that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.719 
efficient as a c-clone octopuses that
are<00:01:48.210> hundreds<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.720> dollars<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:50.610> know

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
if I touch it it's time we adjust it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.250 
if I touch it it's time we adjust it
right<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.480> gotta<00:02:18.690> remember<00:02:18.990> your

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
watermark because as the war line goes

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.700 
watermark because as the war line goes
down<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.850> does<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.450> skimmer<00:02:24.810> adjustment<00:02:25.590> in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
down so does the skimmer adjustment in

whatever so you got to get the same
water<00:02:27.900> bond<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> auto<00:02:29.580> top<00:02:29.940> off

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
water bond if you have a auto top off

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.960 
water bond if you have a auto top off
it'd<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.600> really<00:02:30.780> easy<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.430> doing<00:02:32.760> the

it'd be really easy but I like doing the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.900 
it'd be really easy but I like doing the

that<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.459> think<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.580> when<00:02:42.090> people<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.600> think

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that I think it's when people I think

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.780 
that I think it's when people I think
with<00:02:43.440> no<00:02:43.740> offense<00:02:44.010> if<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.370> apex

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
with no offense if you have apex

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.100 
with no offense if you have apex
controller<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> lot<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> people

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
controller but I think a lot of people

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.780 
controller but I think a lot of people
when<00:02:46.320> they<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.530> them<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:47.490> addicted

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
when they get them I just get addicted

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.710 
when they get them I just get addicted

to the Hobby I have fish as pets nuts
that's<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.709> consider<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.310> hobby

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520

that's what my perspective this though
so<00:03:00.810> you're<00:03:00.959> probably<00:03:01.050> asking<00:03:01.350> why<00:03:02.340> can't<00:03:02.670> i

have<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> problem<00:03:48.870> with<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.940> keep<00:03:50.940> my<00:03:51.120> water

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
have a problem with it I keep my water

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.090 
have a problem with it I keep my water
level<00:03:51.540> down<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.080> little<00:03:52.320> just<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.680> get<00:03:52.799> more<00:03:52.920> air

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
level down a little just to get more air

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.610 
level down a little just to get more air
the<00:03:53.790> skimmer<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.299> get<00:03:54.420> enough<00:03:54.690> air<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.290> you

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
the skimmer to get enough air but you

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.759 
the skimmer to get enough air but you
know<00:03:56.430> does<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.730> hurt<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.060> have<00:03:57.150> too<00:03:57.360> much<00:03:57.480> air

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
know does it hurt to have too much air

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.220 
know does it hurt to have too much air
because<00:03:58.769> honestly<00:03:59.480> the<00:04:00.480> tank<00:04:00.780> wasn't<00:04:01.170> this

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
because honestly the tank wasn't this

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.430 
because honestly the tank wasn't this
clear

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
clear

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.280 
clear
until<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.340> got<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.760> skimmer<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.330> yes<00:04:05.020> it's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
until I got the skimmer and yes it's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.900 
until I got the skimmer and yes it's
because<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.680> skimming<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.190> organics<00:04:06.730> out

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
because it's skimming the organics out

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.630 
because it's skimming the organics out
but<00:04:07.840> number<00:04:08.740> two<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.190> because<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:10.660> hair<00:04:10.810> helps

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
but number two is because the hair helps

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.010 
but number two is because the hair helps
you'd<00:04:12.640> be<00:04:12.730> surprised<00:04:13.180> what<00:04:13.360> aired<00:04:13.540> us<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.930> the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
you'd be surprised what aired us to the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.289 
you'd be surprised what aired us to the
tank<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.530> don't<00:04:15.190> know<00:04:15.340> why<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.550> want<00:04:15.940> people<00:04:16.180> get

tank I don't know why I want people get

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.420 
tank I don't know why I want people get
saltwater<00:04:16.780> they<00:04:17.230> automatically<00:04:17.739> think<00:04:17.830> oh<00:04:18.220> we

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
saltwater they automatically think oh we

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.610 
saltwater they automatically think oh we
don't<00:04:18.580> need<00:04:18.700> air<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.269> that's<00:04:20.170> when<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.530> get

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
don't need air and that's when you get

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.410 
don't need air and that's when you get
ripped<00:04:20.799> off<00:04:21.010> if<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.640> don't<00:04:21.730> have<00:04:21.880> Refuge<00:04:22.210> ohms

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
or some kind of skimmer or something

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.890 
or some kind of skimmer or something
that<00:04:26.860> puts<00:04:27.070> air<00:04:27.310> in<00:04:27.430> your<00:04:27.550> tank<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:28.150> lot<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.810> your

that puts air in your tank a lot of your
fish<00:04:29.050> die<00:04:29.550> that's<00:04:30.550> what<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.820> bio<00:04:31.000> cube

you so the water comes through here
right<00:05:00.910> that's<00:05:01.750> in<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.930> back<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:03.040> can<00:05:03.190> see<00:05:03.370> it

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
right that's in the back you can see it

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.230 
right that's in the back you can see it
it's<00:05:05.050> got<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.290> little<00:05:05.440> uh<00:05:05.650> crap<00:05:06.280> Koby<00:05:06.790> pods<00:05:07.030> on

there<00:05:07.390> where<00:05:07.630> there's<00:05:08.560> little<00:05:08.770> holes<00:05:09.010> in<00:05:09.280> that

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
there where there's little holes in that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.580 
there where there's little holes in that
bottom<00:05:09.790> so<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.120> water<00:05:10.300> enters<00:05:10.690> okay<00:05:11.440> it's

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
should have it on bubbling to here

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.650 
should have it on bubbling to here
that's<00:05:24.070> when<00:05:24.280> your<00:05:24.400> skin<00:05:24.640> mate<00:05:24.820> will<00:05:25.000> form<00:05:25.300> and

not liquid skin mate but you get that

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.780 
not liquid skin mate but you get that
foam<00:05:28.000> which<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:29.020> just<00:05:29.320> proteins<00:05:30.280> and

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
foam which is just proteins and

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.420 
foam which is just proteins and
that<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.480> don't<00:05:31.690> want<00:05:31.840> your<00:05:31.990> tank<00:05:32.230> but<00:05:33.010> it

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
overflow up in here and it'll do that

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.270

don't<00:06:02.830> know<00:06:02.920> why<00:06:03.130> exactly<00:06:03.160> but<00:06:03.670> I<00:06:03.850> found<00:06:04.000> that

don't know why exactly but I found that

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.100 
don't know why exactly but I found that
for<00:06:04.450> my<00:06:04.600> finger<00:06:04.990> over<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.350> it<00:06:06.130> along<00:06:07.110> it's
