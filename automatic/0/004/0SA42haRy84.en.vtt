power for about the better charge the
batteries<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.809> about<00:00:49.320> four<00:00:49.649> times<00:00:50.149> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
batteries on this about four times so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
batteries on this about four times so
basically<00:00:51.420> every<00:00:51.660> time<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.860> penis

session you disconnect it store it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.619 
session you disconnect it store it
inside<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.969> would<00:00:57.059> automatically

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
inside here and it would automatically

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
inside here and it would automatically

both<00:01:03.359> great<00:01:03.660> products<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:04.920> won't<00:01:05.129> work

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
both great products but they won't work

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
both great products but they won't work
with<00:01:05.580> each<00:01:05.729> other<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> reason<00:01:06.930> why<00:01:07.140> they

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
with each other now the reason why they

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
with each other now the reason why they
won't<00:01:07.500> work<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.920> each<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.490> because

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
won't work for each other is because

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.469 
won't work for each other is because
this<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.900> has<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> manual<00:01:10.920> battery

batteries<00:02:00.119> i'll<00:02:00.540> show<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
batteries i'll show you what a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.980 
batteries i'll show you what a
difference<00:02:01.350> between<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> two<00:02:01.890> batteries<00:02:02.990> or

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
difference between the two batteries or

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.800 
difference between the two batteries or
just<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.469> connect<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.060> for<00:02:06.060> starters<00:02:06.329> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
just is to connect that for starters you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.160 
just is to connect that for starters you
can<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.489> one<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.640> them<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.479> slightly<00:02:09.869> longer

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
can see one of them is slightly longer

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
he's put about four millimeters longer

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.510 
he's put about four millimeters longer

the way dad's when it comes to closing
the<00:02:36.190> lid<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:37.060> quite<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.810> two<00:02:37.900> three

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the lid it's quite you have two three

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.200 
the lid it's quite you have two three
false<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.770> better<00:02:38.950> close<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.400> lid<00:02:39.580> but

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
false it's better close the lid but

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.280 
false it's better close the lid but
obviously<00:02:40.330> it's<00:02:40.660> not<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:40.990> going<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.200> be

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
obviously it's not really going to be

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.410 
obviously it's not really going to be
charging<00:02:41.740> up<00:02:41.950> if<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:42.370> also<00:02:42.520> activating<00:02:43.330> it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
charging up if it's also activating it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.770 
charging up if it's also activating it
at<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> same<00:02:43.840> time<00:02:45.000> whereas<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.300> automatic

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
at the same time whereas the automatic

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.660 
at the same time whereas the automatic
batteries<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:47.440> fixed<00:02:48.100> rate<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.430> there

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
batteries just fixed rate in there

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.460 
batteries just fixed rate in there
you're<00:02:49.060> close<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.420> lid<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.810> he<00:02:50.110> starts

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
you're close the lid and he starts

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.630 
you're close the lid and he starts
charging<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:52.540> now<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> much<00:02:53.260> prefer<00:02:53.680> using<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
charging but now I much prefer using the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.060 
charging but now I much prefer using the
mangled<00:02:55.000> batteries<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.930> really<00:02:56.290> want<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
mangled batteries and I really want the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.190 
mangled batteries and I really want the
PCC<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.850> bear<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.300> all<00:02:58.480> charged<00:02:58.720> up<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.050> main

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
PCC to bear this all charged up the main

PCC to bear this all charged up the main
your<00:02:59.320> batteries<00:02:59.800> now<00:03:00.370> there<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.610> quite<00:03:00.880> an

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
your batteries now there is quite an

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.690 
your batteries now there is quite an
easy<00:03:01.120> way<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.750> about<00:03:01.900> fixing<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.700> all

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
easy way of going about fixing this all

easy way of going about fixing this all
you<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.060> do<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.560> site<00:03:05.800> here<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.190> have

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
you have to do on the site here you have

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.460 
you have to do on the site here you have
a<00:03:06.310> little<00:03:06.550> screw<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.720> side<00:03:07.960> there<00:03:08.290> you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
a little screw and on the side there you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.340 
a little screw and on the side there you
have<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> little<00:03:08.830> screw<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:10.600> unscrew<00:03:11.170> there

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
have a little screw just unscrew there

cover and you've got this section here
and<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.320> just<00:03:35.440> pull<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.740> straight<00:03:36.280> out

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
and you can just pull that straight out

and you can just pull that straight out
it<00:03:36.910> will<00:03:37.120> come<00:03:37.390> out<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:38.160> little<00:03:39.160> bit<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.520> a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
it will come out a little bit of a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.949 
it will come out a little bit of a
little<00:03:40.570> bit<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.750> force<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.600> there<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> have

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
little bit of force and there you have

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.380 
little bit of force and there you have
it<00:03:44.140> now<00:03:44.440> what<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.250> done<00:03:45.610> here<00:03:45.880> unfortunately<00:03:46.000> I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
it now what I done here unfortunately I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.460 
it now what I done here unfortunately I
can't<00:03:46.570> actually<00:03:46.720> show<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.290> whole

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
can't actually show you the whole

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.770 
can't actually show you the whole
process<00:03:48.070> from<00:03:48.100> start<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.700> finish<00:03:49.030> simply

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
process from start to finish simply

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.810 
process from start to finish simply
because<00:03:49.870> these<00:03:50.290> are<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.470> battle<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.340> battle

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
because these are the battle a battle

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.690 
because these are the battle a battle
between<00:03:52.150> 25<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:52.959> 35<00:03:53.440> pounds<00:03:54.010> ago<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.550> either

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
between 25 and 35 pounds ago so either

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.940 
between 25 and 35 pounds ago so either
basically<00:03:55.690> saw<00:03:55.870> one<00:03:56.110> chance<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.830> right

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
basically saw one chance to get it right

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.250 
basically saw one chance to get it right
so<00:03:57.820> what<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.180> can<00:03:58.360> show<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.630> how<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.900> done<00:03:59.200> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
so what I can show you how I done it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.110 
so what I can show you how I done it

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.570 
though and all I did was like I've got a
file<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.890> stay<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.459> get

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
file like this just stay you can get

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.430 
file like this just stay you can get
these<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:03.910> from<00:04:04.180> craft<00:04:04.540> shops<00:04:04.900> or<00:04:05.230> from

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
these like from craft shops or from

these like from craft shops or from
silver<00:04:06.180> sort<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.240> motor<00:04:07.480> carriages<00:04:07.990> things

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
silver sort of motor carriages things

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
like that and it's a ways a flat file

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.380 
like that and it's a ways a flat file
and<00:04:10.780> some<00:04:11.620> dis<00:04:11.950> down<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.400> end<00:04:12.700> here<00:04:13.060> it's

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
also got are you a fold edge there and

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.990 
also got are you a fold edge there and
were<00:04:16.660> done<00:04:16.870> was<00:04:17.500> really<00:04:17.950> hold<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.549> against<00:04:18.820> the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
end now and then just start sawing into

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.550 
end now and then just start sawing into
it<00:04:21.790> until<00:04:22.000> I've<00:04:22.540> got<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.020> sort<00:04:23.290> of<00:04:23.320> depth

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
it until I've got to that sort of depth

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
roll paper towel and force it down to

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.550 
roll paper towel and force it down to
the<00:04:30.789> bottom<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.210> hold<00:04:31.479> air<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.380> try

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
the bottom of that hold air just to try

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.450 
the bottom of that hold air just to try
to<00:04:32.590> protect<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:34.319> the<00:04:35.319> other<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.770> connector

to protect the the other the connector
at<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.639> bottom<00:04:36.940> is<00:04:37.030> actually<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.599> solver<00:04:38.020> joins

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
at the bottom is actually a solver joins

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.650 
at the bottom is actually a solver joins
on<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:39.039> the<00:04:39.190> battery<00:04:39.880> park<00:04:40.180> there<00:04:40.419> just

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
on to the battery park there just

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.120 
on to the battery park there just
because<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.930> don't<00:04:41.020> get<00:04:41.259> too<00:04:41.410> much<00:04:41.530> dirty<00:04:41.830> I

forgot<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.229> do<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.710> but<00:04:45.069> I<00:04:45.160> didn't<00:04:45.370> actually

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
forgot to do it but I didn't actually

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.550 
forgot to do it but I didn't actually
clean<00:04:45.759> it<00:04:45.880> out<00:04:45.940> nicely<00:04:46.000> afters<00:04:46.780> by<00:04:46.960> doing<00:04:47.470> the

of wd-40 on the end of it and it clean
down<00:04:54.759> nicely<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:55.690> basically<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:56.080> all<00:04:56.229> you

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
down nicely so basically that's all you

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.020 
down nicely so basically that's all you
have<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.889> just<00:04:57.250> keeps<00:04:57.430> fighting<00:04:57.729> the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
have to do it just keeps fighting the

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.240 
have to do it just keeps fighting the
way<00:04:58.150> out<00:04:58.330> there<00:04:58.569> and<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.289> don't<00:04:59.470> need<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.099> go

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
way out there and you don't need to go

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.760 
way out there and you don't need to go
all<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.610> way<00:05:00.639> down<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:02.050> can<00:05:02.169> go<00:05:02.289> pretty<00:05:02.470> about

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
all the way down you can go pretty about

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.200 
all the way down you can go pretty about
some<00:05:02.949> free<00:05:03.220> calls<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.729> just<00:05:03.909> want<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.120> make

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
some free calls you just want to make

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.390 
some free calls you just want to make
sure<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.690> button<00:05:05.169> there's<00:05:06.130> enough

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
sure that button there's enough

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.909 
sure that button there's enough
clearance<00:05:06.699> here<00:05:07.150> so<00:05:07.720> afterwards<00:05:08.289> when<00:05:08.800> you

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
clearance here so afterwards when you

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.180 
clearance here so afterwards when you
push<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.280> in<00:05:09.460> now<00:05:10.169> you<00:05:11.169> can<00:05:11.319> see<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.949> bun

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
push that in now you can see the bun

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.210 
push that in now you can see the bun
fits<00:05:12.639> in<00:05:12.880> there<00:05:13.060> pretty<00:05:13.720> much<00:05:13.930> perfectly<00:05:14.500> and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
fits in there pretty much perfectly and

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.040 
fits in there pretty much perfectly and
you<00:05:15.370> got<00:05:15.550> enough<00:05:15.759> room<00:05:16.000> there<00:05:16.330> for<00:05:16.509> the<00:05:16.720> spring

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
you got enough room there for the spring

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.070 
you got enough room there for the spring
mechanism<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.680> work<00:05:17.979> at<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.220> bottom<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:19.080> all

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
mechanism to work at the bottom and all

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.029 
mechanism to work at the bottom and all
you<00:05:20.169> have<00:05:20.229> to<00:05:20.349> do<00:05:20.470> after<00:05:20.740> you've<00:05:20.830> done<00:05:20.979> that

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
you have to do after you've done that

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.710 
you have to do after you've done that
it's<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.400> sort<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.610> tidy<00:05:21.940> up<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.180> AGS<00:05:22.449> maybe

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
it's just sort of tidy up the AGS maybe

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.960 
it's just sort of tidy up the AGS maybe
a<00:05:22.810> little<00:05:22.930> bit<00:05:23.139> of<00:05:23.229> sandpaper<00:05:23.740> they're<00:05:24.130> clean

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
a little bit of sandpaper they're clean

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
bit of pressure on to the hinge there

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.690 
bit of pressure on to the hinge there
because<00:06:40.420> he<00:06:40.570> is<00:06:40.660> still<00:06:40.870> slightly<00:06:41.110> longer<00:06:41.700> but

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
because he is still slightly longer but

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.190 
because he is still slightly longer but
I've<00:06:42.790> not<00:06:42.940> found<00:06:43.180> a<00:06:43.360> way<00:06:43.510> of<00:06:43.690> bananas<00:06:44.050> will

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
I've not found a way of bananas will

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.290 
I've not found a way of bananas will
drop<00:06:44.440> that<00:06:44.560> down<00:06:44.830> right<00:06:45.340> there<00:06:45.550> is<00:06:45.700> a<00:06:45.730> ton<00:06:46.270> of

drop that down right there is a ton of

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.270 
drop that down right there is a ton of
glue<00:06:46.690> on<00:06:46.870> that<00:06:47.050> connection<00:06:47.530> inside<00:06:47.920> there

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
glue on that connection inside there

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.790 
glue on that connection inside there
which<00:06:49.030> I<00:06:49.210> suppose<00:06:49.420> he<00:06:49.480> feels<00:06:49.930> very<00:06:50.260> careful

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800

you<00:06:50.920> could<00:06:51.130> take<00:06:51.790> off<00:06:52.060> drop<00:06:52.510> it<00:06:52.630> down<00:06:52.780> a<00:06:52.840> bit

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
you could take off drop it down a bit

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.740 
you could take off drop it down a bit
and<00:06:53.200> reglue<00:06:53.710> it<00:06:53.740> but<00:06:54.340> I<00:06:54.880> tried<00:06:55.360> hacking<00:06:55.570> away

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
and reglue it but I tried hacking away

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.210 
and reglue it but I tried hacking away
