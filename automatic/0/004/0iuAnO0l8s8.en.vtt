00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.510
 with the energy monitor energy supplier the hague anp 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.009
 consumers the increased level of energy consumption in a simple way 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.320

 so that they can also make targeted savings 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.849
 the optio energy monitoring supplement to the smart meter and my setup 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.079
 in it the consumption of the customer is shown pursuit 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.770

 it is easy 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.400
 time to gain the energy monitor does not immediately save energy, but 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.720
 it is a tool that the customer can use to go focused and not to go 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.740

 provide insight into usage 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.320
 the US energy supplier is from energy consumption to the consumer 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 enlarge the energy market there is very easy use of the land 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.159
 to the many points, nrk also reports that he is one of the variants that we have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.140
 then in his own mines optio environment retrieves a personal code and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.570
 with that he takes fourteen of his energy monitor and at that moment the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.250
 energy monitor are also his use
