00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.180
 cretin is mine good let's follow the friend 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.160
 imaginary a few years ago my parents my 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.340
 uncles and my grandparents we moved to a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.800
 nice house in rochester minnesota 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.540
 we are originally from Mexico 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.030
 what we moved was a big change in 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.550
 our lives our house in 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 particular was very large three stories 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.079
 cold and several of the oldest in the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.270
 neighborhood they said that in that house a 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.629
 mother had killed one of her children 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.940
 Sebastian but we do not take 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.850
 importance and we were careless my 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.680
 cousin without friends had to play alone 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
 so a week after 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 move to that house he introduced us to his 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.000
 new friend sebastián us 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 we thought he was an imaginary friend 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.020
 because she always spoke alone and when we 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.000
 he presented it his hand was stretched out 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.240
 way as if I was shaking his hand 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.849
 to another person the first few days we did not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.080
 We worried because my little cousin 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.880
 I saw very happy playing 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.580
 and running with his friend all over the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.770
 house as we thought it would already have 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.890
 someone to play with we let him 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.200
 had an imaginary friend the first 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.540
 days he behaved normal but after 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.090
 of the five days with sebastián she 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.580
 he began to behave strangely of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.070
 be a playful and talkative girl 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.170
 I had done very quiet did not speak 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.630
 I was getting pale and sometimes at all 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.240
 1 day did not talk we started to 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.770
 worry but after a few days the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.530
 thing got much worse 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.870
 my aunt was angry since she was doing many 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.180
 wrongs and when you asked who 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.430
 had been she said that Sebastian 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.440
 he had said or that Sebastian told him that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.510
 if he did not do it his parents were going to 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.350
 stop wanting and a lot more 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.720
 manipulations two days later he started 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.570
 to become more rebellious by answering 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 my uncles hitting them and yelling at them when 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.950
 my uncles scolded her in it she would get 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.709
 worse as if I had a demon inside 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.050
 they went to a psychologist and nothing with a cure 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.060
 nothing with a pediatrician anything until a 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.400
 day I heard there was a lot of noise in their 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.739
 room then we open and little 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.590
 I saw her talking to a child if a child 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.930
 not older than 7 years that manipulated it to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.319
 that did bad things opens a little more 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.819
 the door but half and totally changed 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.030
 from being a boy he became a man 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.069
 skinny tall and black he told me unhappy 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.030
 from now on this little soul 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.010
 belongs 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.980
 so stay away if you do not want me to take 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.049
 extreme measures after this I was cold 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.629
 when I tried to tell my parents 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.180
 or my uncles suddenly learned 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.400
 television or they talked to the phone or they 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.049
 things fell until one day he went to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.180
 my room and he told me that I had 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.120
 fact that things will get worse and that if 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.190
 I wanted pain pain I was going to have to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 midnight when I woke up to urinate 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.060
 or to drink a glass of water appeared my 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.400
 cousin with her mouth bled and with 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.170
 knives or the television was turned on and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.720
 in it there were photos and videos of children 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.840
 mutilated and that man hitting them or 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.639
 torturing them I let go of crying 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 at the end a bonus video was played 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.680
 crying tied to a chair and told me 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.109
 that will not make things worse there I felt 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.400
 impotent so I tried to find her 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.650
 when I talked to him 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.590
 to hit him and kill him but then 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.170
 I never saw it happen every night 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.970
 so try to stop doing it 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.000
 uncles went on a trip to the coast to 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.159
 distract my cousin a little one day that 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.019
 I was playing video games at the time 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.480
 save them I was shown a file that 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.970
 Segovia said everything I opened serious error 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.370
 it showed my cousin on a bridge 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.790
 very high and with a very serious voice 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.859
 I said son of all this is your fault if 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.200
 you would not have got your damn nose not 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.120
 I would be like that at that moment I started 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.639
 cry and I could not do anything more than 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.400
 To feel guilt they reignite I started to see 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.289
 television and in the news there was one of 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.900
 your special bulletins where 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.389
 they announced sudden deaths and so on 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.970
 one of those news said a girl from 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.010
 approximately 5 years was found 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.139
 dead under a bridge has not been 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.849
 identified but a camera was found 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.740
 in the act that contains a tape 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.900
 insulting a cousin of hers 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.820
