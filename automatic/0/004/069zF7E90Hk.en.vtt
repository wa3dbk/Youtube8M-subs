the<00:00:15.509> answer<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.839> course<00:00:15.870> depends<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:16.859> are

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the answer of course depends on what are

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.609 
the answer of course depends on what are
your<00:00:17.310> needs<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.940> what's<00:00:18.330> your<00:00:18.539> budget<00:00:18.779> but

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
your needs and what's your budget but

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
your needs and what's your budget but
generally<00:00:20.070> bikes<00:00:20.699> tend<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.210> most

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
generally bikes tend to have most

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.599 
generally bikes tend to have most
features<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.140> common<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> type

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
features in common it's just the type

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.779 
features in common it's just the type
and<00:00:23.880> size<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.019> ability<00:00:25.439> increases<00:00:26.400> as<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and size and ability increases as the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.419 
and size and ability increases as the
budget<00:00:26.939> goes<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.340> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
budget goes up you can see from this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.099 
budget goes up you can see from this
video<00:00:29.580> footage<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.330> substantial<00:00:30.990> difference

between<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> two<00:00:31.859> bikes<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
between the two bikes we have in the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660 
between the two bikes we have in the
video<00:00:33.440> but<00:00:34.440> we'll<00:00:34.590> focus<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> larger<00:00:35.340> one

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
video but we'll focus on the larger one

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.920 
video but we'll focus on the larger one
with<00:00:35.880> more<00:00:36.000> features<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.899> can

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
with more features and you can

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450 
with more features and you can
understand<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> things<00:00:38.219> you've<00:00:38.370> got

understand some of the things you've got

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
understand some of the things you've got
to<00:00:38.579> give<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.180> cheap<00:00:39.420> ones<00:00:40.070> classic

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070

example<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> handlebars<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
example is the handlebars on the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
example is the handlebars on the
cheapest<00:00:43.530> ones<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> handlebars<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.520> not

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
cheapest ones the handlebars are not

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
cheapest ones the handlebars are not
adjustable<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:45.960> here

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
adjustable but as you can see here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
adjustable but as you can see here
they're<00:00:46.800> fully<00:00:47.070> adjustable<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:48.000> lean

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
they're fully adjustable so you can lean

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450 
they're fully adjustable so you can lean
forward<00:00:48.210> sit<00:00:49.079> upright<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.800> even<00:00:50.039> lean<00:00:50.219> back

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
forward sit upright or even lean back

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.979 
forward sit upright or even lean back
and<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> handlebars<00:00:51.449> come<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> way

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and have the handlebars come all the way

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.740 
and have the handlebars come all the way
to<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.379> there's<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> drink<00:00:53.730> holder<00:00:53.910> need

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
to you there's also a drink holder need

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.180 
to you there's also a drink holder need
to<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.870> able<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> drink<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.860> models

to be able to put a drink not all models

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
to be able to put a drink not all models
have<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> way

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
have this and you can see from the way

these years shaking that bike this is a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.139 
these years shaking that bike this is a
good<00:01:00.899> solid<00:01:01.350> strong<00:01:01.920> bike<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.850> smaller

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
good solid strong bike and the smaller

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
good solid strong bike and the smaller
bikes<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.719> obviously<00:01:04.080> much<00:01:04.320> smaller<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
bikes are obviously much smaller and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160 
bikes are obviously much smaller and
have<00:01:05.100> less<00:01:05.280> steel<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.869> difference

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
have less steel in them one difference

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
have less steel in them one difference
between<00:01:07.229> bikes<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.130> whether<00:01:08.430> they've<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
between bikes is whether they've got a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
between bikes is whether they've got a
one-piece<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.720> three<00:01:10.049> piece<00:01:10.290> crank<00:01:10.530> a

it's<00:01:14.670> obviously<00:01:15.150> weaker<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.689> three<00:01:16.290> piece

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's obviously weaker a three piece

but<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.930> better<00:02:36.110> models<00:02:36.470> have<00:02:36.740> what's<00:02:36.920> called

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
but the better models have what's called

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.010 
but the better models have what's called
wireless<00:02:37.670> heart<00:02:37.910> rate<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.720> means<00:02:38.900> you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
wireless heart rate and that means you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.900 
wireless heart rate and that means you
can<00:02:39.170> wear<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.350> chest<00:02:39.650> strap<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.100> constantly

while you tune out and watch TV hidden
inside<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:04.070> bike<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.460> what's<00:03:04.670> called<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
inside the bike is what's called the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.150 
inside the bike is what's called the
flywheel<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.110> this<00:03:06.260> can<00:03:06.410> vary<00:03:06.440> generally

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
flywheel and this can vary generally

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160 
flywheel and this can vary generally
from<00:03:07.370> four<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.880> six<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.240> eight<00:03:08.360> kilograms<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:09.140> a

from four to six to eight kilograms on a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.470 
from four to six to eight kilograms on a
bike<00:03:09.430> obviously<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.550> larger<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> flywheel

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
bike obviously the larger the flywheel

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480 
bike obviously the larger the flywheel
the<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:12.140> expensive<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.650> bike<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.070> but<00:03:13.400> that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
the more expensive the bike is but that

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.700 
the more expensive the bike is but that
also<00:03:13.640> means<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.390> smoother<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.200> has<00:03:15.650> a

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
also means it's smoother and has a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.280 
also means it's smoother and has a
better<00:03:15.980> feel<00:03:16.310> as<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:17.150> bike<00:03:17.360> for<00:03:18.140> long

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
better feel as you bike for long

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.490 
better feel as you bike for long
distances<00:03:19.330> also<00:03:20.330> obviously<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.960> more<00:03:21.200> steel

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
distances also obviously the more steel

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.320 
distances also obviously the more steel
they<00:03:21.650> using<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.070> machine<00:03:22.400> gives<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.120> higher

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
they using the machine gives it a higher

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.060 
they using the machine gives it a higher
user<00:03:23.630> capacity<00:03:24.200> some<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.650> them<00:03:24.770> up<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:24.920> about
