that you want to do is you want to take

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.810 
that you want to do is you want to take
your<00:00:14.460> foil<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.289> flip<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.680> over<00:00:16.830> so

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
your foil and you just flip it over so

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330 
your foil and you just flip it over so
that<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> backside<00:00:19.039> that's<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
that you have the backside that's the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.630 
that you have the backside that's the
side<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.939> would<00:00:21.510> put<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.920> transfer

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
side that you would put on to transfer

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.630 
side that you would put on to transfer
the<00:00:23.730> foil<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> sometimes<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.220> doesn't<00:00:26.400> want

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the foil and sometimes it doesn't want

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.900 
the foil and sometimes it doesn't want
to<00:00:26.730> release<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.279> spray<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to release so what I do is I spray it a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.020 
to release so what I do is I spray it a
little<00:00:30.150> bit<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.660> rubbing<00:00:31.050> alcohol<00:00:31.759> wipe<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
little bit with rubbing alcohol wipe the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
little bit with rubbing alcohol wipe the
back<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.230> helps<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> foil

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
back of it and it helps so that the foil

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
back of it and it helps so that the foil
will<00:00:35.640> release<00:00:36.059> better<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.410> have

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
will release better now that you have

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
will release better now that you have
that<00:00:37.559> prepared<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.280> set<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> aside<00:00:38.940> be
