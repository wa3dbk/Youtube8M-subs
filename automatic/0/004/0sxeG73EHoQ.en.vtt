how<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.510> make<00:00:03.659> fabric<00:00:04.410> beads<00:00:04.710> here's<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.609> couple

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
how to make fabric beads here's a couple

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.179 
how to make fabric beads here's a couple
of<00:00:06.060> samples<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:07.020> beads<00:00:07.410> that<00:00:07.680> I've<00:00:07.799> made<00:00:08.010> and

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
of samples of beads that I've made and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.669 
of samples of beads that I've made and
turned<00:00:08.550> into<00:00:08.790> necklaces<00:00:09.090> so<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.349> one

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
turned into necklaces so this this one

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.280 
turned into necklaces so this this one
is<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.370> Tiger<00:00:11.820> Tail<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.330> then<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.049> one

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is on the Tiger Tail and then this one

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.010 
is on the Tiger Tail and then this one
is<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> black<00:00:13.980> cotton<00:00:14.820> cord<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.839> they're

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is on a black cotton cord so they're

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
is on a black cotton cord so they're
very<00:00:16.199> easy<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.710> make<00:00:16.920> all<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.460> need<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.940> the

very easy to make all you need is the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.570 
very easy to make all you need is the
bamboo<00:00:18.750> skewer<00:00:19.640> piece<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.820> fabric<00:00:22.220> 28<00:00:23.220> gauge

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
bamboo skewer piece of fabric 28 gauge

wool seed beads and some white glue so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
wool seed beads and some white glue so
I'm<00:00:35.700> gonna<00:00:35.850> start<00:00:36.210> by<00:00:36.300> cutting<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.170> strip<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I'm gonna start by cutting a strip of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.530 
I'm gonna start by cutting a strip of
fabric<00:00:38.989> no<00:00:39.989> real<00:00:40.469> rules<00:00:40.770> about<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.300> 3/4<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> an

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
fabric no real rules about a 3/4 of an

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.020 
fabric no real rules about a 3/4 of an
inch<00:00:42.660> about<00:00:43.079> its<00:00:43.770> tearing<00:00:44.160> into<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.460> long<00:00:44.640> piece

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
inch about its tearing into a long piece

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.410 
inch about its tearing into a long piece
it<00:00:45.930> could<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.489> thicker<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> bigger

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it could be thicker if you want a bigger

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
it could be thicker if you want a bigger
bead<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.960> thinner<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.950> thin<00:00:50.160> bead

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
bead or thinner if you want a thin bead

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.250 
bead or thinner if you want a thin bead
so<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.030> gonna<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.420> take<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.809> strip<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so I'm gonna just take this strip of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.189 
so I'm gonna just take this strip of
fabric<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> roll<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.210> around<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.870> skewer

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
fabric and roll it around the skewer

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139 
fabric and roll it around the skewer
like<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.699> round<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
like that it's going to go round and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
like that it's going to go round and
round<00:00:57.210> try<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> keep<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.649> side<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
round try to keep the right side of the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.429 
round try to keep the right side of the
fabric<00:00:59.820> out<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> cotton<00:01:03.570> fabric<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
fabric out this is a cotton fabric you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
fabric out this is a cotton fabric you
can<00:01:04.559> use<00:01:04.739> any<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.369> fabric<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.090> like

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
can use any kind of fabric that you like

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
can use any kind of fabric that you like
this<00:01:07.080> bead<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.680> end<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:07.979> being<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.310> little

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
this bead is gonna end up being a little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
this bead is gonna end up being a little
bit<00:01:08.729> bigger<00:01:09.000> than<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.479> other<00:01:09.659> ones<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.229> cuz

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
bit bigger than my other ones just cuz

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
bit bigger than my other ones just cuz
the<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.790> bit<00:01:12.030> thicker

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the it's a little bit thicker

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
the it's a little bit thicker
we'll<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.049> round<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.439> round<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.939> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
we'll go round and round like that and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.630 
we'll go round and round like that and
then<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.350> could<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.619> put<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.310> tiny

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
then you could just put a little tiny

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
then you could just put a little tiny
dab<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.920> white<00:01:19.920> glue<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:21.180> hot<00:01:21.240> glue<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.049> hold<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
dab of white glue or hot glue to hold it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
dab of white glue or hot glue to hold it
in<00:01:22.710> place<00:01:23.180> put<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> just

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
in place put a little bit more and just

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
in place put a little bit more and just
rub<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.650> down<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> hold<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.729> down

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
rub it down that's just to hold it down

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
rub it down that's just to hold it down
basically<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.780> wire<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.380> hold<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
basically the wire is gonna hold it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
basically the wire is gonna hold it
together<00:01:31.890> anyways<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.079> like

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
together anyways so we're gonna go like

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
together anyways so we're gonna go like
that<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.700> you're<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.420> some<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that and then you're gonna get some of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.910 
that and then you're gonna get some of
your<00:01:36.900> fancy<00:01:37.200> cord<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.840> wrap<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.079> around<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
your fancy cord and wrap it around like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.630 
your fancy cord and wrap it around like
that<00:01:41.810> any<00:01:42.810> which<00:01:43.110> way<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.460> once

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you have enough you can just clip it off

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.580 
you have enough you can just clip it off
I<00:01:47.060> don't<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.240> too<00:01:48.450> much<00:01:48.659> cuz<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> want<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> be

I don't want too much cuz I want to be
able<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> fabric<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> we're<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:51.930> go

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
able to see the fabric so we're gonna go

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.160 
able to see the fabric so we're gonna go
around<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.810> could<00:01:55.020> glue

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
around like that and then you could glue

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.429 
around like that and then you could glue
the<00:01:55.380> ends<00:01:55.680> down<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.219> little<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.090> like

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
the ends down a little bit if you like

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
the ends down a little bit if you like
doesn't<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.590> matter<00:01:59.180> it's<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.540> kind

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
doesn't really matter it's gonna be kind

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.090 
doesn't really matter it's gonna be kind
of<00:02:00.840> covered<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.229> anyways<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> glue

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
of covered up anyways and the glue

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.300 
of covered up anyways and the glue
should<00:02:02.340> try<00:02:02.869> clear<00:02:03.869> okay<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.469> we've<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:04.890> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
should try clear okay so we've got that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.700 
should try clear okay so we've got that
that<00:02:05.880> much<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.409> gonna<00:02:07.500> get

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that much here and then you're gonna get

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.180 
that much here and then you're gonna get
a<00:02:07.770> piece<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.220> wire

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
a piece of wire

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.720 
a piece of wire
to<00:02:09.700> pee<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:11.730> there's<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> about<00:02:13.150> right<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
to pee on is there's the about right and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.450 
to pee on is there's the about right and
then<00:02:16.090> we're<00:02:16.240> gonna<00:02:16.360> lay<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.930> bead<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.800> here

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
then we're gonna lay this bead on here

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.630 
then we're gonna lay this bead on here
and<00:02:18.670> take<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> wire<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.230> just<00:02:20.620> twist<00:02:21.430> it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
and take the wire and just twist it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.910 
and take the wire and just twist it
around<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.510> kind<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.140> centered<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:23.830> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
around so it's kind of centered so you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.090 
around so it's kind of centered so you
have<00:02:24.100> big<00:02:24.310> long<00:02:24.640> ends<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.150> each<00:02:25.330> side<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.470> then

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
have big long ends on each side and then

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.760 
have big long ends on each side and then
at<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.970> point<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.510> could<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.990> wind<00:02:29.320> your

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
at this point you could just wind your

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.790 
at this point you could just wind your
wires<00:02:30.010> around<00:02:30.510> any<00:02:31.510> which<00:02:31.750> way<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.020> like<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
wires around any which way you like and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.900 
wires around any which way you like and
I'm<00:02:33.220> gonna<00:02:33.370> add<00:02:33.930> beads<00:02:34.930> as<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:36.340> go<00:02:36.550> these<00:02:36.850> are

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
I'm gonna add beads as I go these are

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.510 
I'm gonna add beads as I go these are
little<00:02:37.270> seed<00:02:37.540> beads<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.800> could<00:02:38.950> put<00:02:39.130> larger

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
little seed beads you could put larger

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.660 
little seed beads you could put larger
beads<00:02:39.760> if<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.890> I'll<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:41.920> pop<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> bunch

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
beads if you like I'll just pop a bunch

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.500 
beads if you like I'll just pop a bunch
on<00:02:42.940> at<00:02:43.480> once<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.500> space<00:02:44.890> them<00:02:45.130> out

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
on at once and then I can space them out

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.780 
on at once and then I can space them out
as<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.810> go<00:02:47.020> it's<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.830> whole<00:02:48.010> bunch<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.460> different

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
as we go it's a whole bunch of different

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.530 
as we go it's a whole bunch of different
beads<00:02:49.260> different<00:02:50.260> sizes<00:02:50.740> if<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.070> like<00:02:51.450> or<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
beads different sizes if you like or you

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.920 
beads different sizes if you like or you
could<00:02:52.720> do<00:02:52.810> all<00:02:53.020> little<00:02:53.440> ones<00:02:54.540> there's<00:02:55.540> no<00:02:55.720> real

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
could do all little ones there's no real

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.170 
could do all little ones there's no real
rules<00:02:56.230> about<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.340> as<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.580> wind<00:02:58.000> it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
rules about it and then as I wind it

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.510 
rules about it and then as I wind it
around<00:02:58.240> I'm<00:02:58.660> gonna<00:02:58.780> space<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.740> beads<00:02:59.950> out<00:03:00.190> a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
around I'm gonna space the beads out a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.080 
around I'm gonna space the beads out a
little<00:03:01.180> bit<00:03:01.450> more<00:03:02.310> sometimes<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.730> could<00:03:03.910> put

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
little bit more sometimes I could put

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.460 
little bit more sometimes I could put
maybe<00:03:04.330> two<00:03:04.630> together<00:03:06.630> matter<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.230> go<00:03:08.290> around

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
maybe two together matter so I go around

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.300 
maybe two together matter so I go around
and<00:03:09.310> then<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.180> finish<00:03:10.420> off<00:03:10.800> when<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:11.920> have<00:03:12.070> one

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
and then to finish off when you have one

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.520 
and then to finish off when you have one
end<00:03:12.520> almost<00:03:12.820> finished<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.720> actually<00:03:14.290> are

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
end almost finished you actually are

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.030 
end almost finished you actually are
gonna<00:03:14.680> put<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:14.980> through<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:16.480> bead<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:17.739> that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
gonna put it through the bead like that

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.650 
gonna put it through the bead like that
and<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:20.470> when<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.860> sew<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.480> need

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
and just like when you sew and you need

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.510 
and just like when you sew and you need
to<00:03:22.780> finish<00:03:22.989> an<00:03:23.290> end<00:03:23.590> you're<00:03:23.980> going<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.190> put<00:03:24.400> it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
to finish an end you're going to put it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.330 
to finish an end you're going to put it
through<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.940> bead<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> few<00:03:25.600> times<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.340> secure

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
through the bead a few times to secure

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.449 
through the bead a few times to secure
it<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.790> place<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.330> won't<00:03:28.570> fray<00:03:28.989> out<00:03:29.709> and

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
it in place so it won't fray out and

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.240 
it in place so it won't fray out and
this<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.850> why<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.510> wires<00:03:31.750> because

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
this is why I like the wires because

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.210 
this is why I like the wires because
once<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.400> pinched<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.120> place<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:35.709> pretty

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
once you pinched it in place it's pretty

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.729 
once you pinched it in place it's pretty
secure<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:37.030> it'll<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.570> stay<00:03:37.780> there<00:03:38.019> so

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
secure and it'll just stay there so

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.270 
secure and it'll just stay there so
we're<00:03:38.890> just<00:03:38.920> gonna<00:03:39.130> push<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.610> right<00:03:39.760> through

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
we're just gonna push it right through

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.000 
we're just gonna push it right through
and<00:03:42.280> then<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.640> end<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:43.330> cut<00:03:43.600> with<00:03:44.320> your<00:03:44.530> wire

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and then the end just cut with your wire

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.050 
and then the end just cut with your wire
cutters<00:03:46.140> same<00:03:47.140> for<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.500> other<00:03:47.650> end<00:03:48.060> you're

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
cutters same for the other end you're

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.030 
cutters same for the other end you're
just<00:03:49.300> gonna<00:03:49.480> wind<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.230> around<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.769> find

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
just gonna wind it around if you find

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.759 
just gonna wind it around if you find
one<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.489> ends<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> little<00:03:52.390> bunchy<00:03:52.930> you

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
one of the ends is a little bunchy you

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.120 
one of the ends is a little bunchy you
just<00:03:54.040> twist<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.690> harder<00:03:55.690> around<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.200> end<00:03:56.440> and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
just twist it harder around that end and

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.910 
just twist it harder around that end and
I'm<00:03:57.370> gonna<00:03:57.489> add<00:03:57.730> some<00:03:57.760> more<00:03:58.209> beads<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.769> I'll

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
I'm gonna add some more beads so I'll

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.540 
I'm gonna add some more beads so I'll
grab<00:04:00.040> some<00:04:00.430> more<00:04:00.580> of<00:04:00.640> my<00:04:00.730> sea<00:04:01.209> beads<00:04:01.450> here<00:04:02.550> just

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
grab some more of my sea beads here just

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.290 
grab some more of my sea beads here just
a<00:04:03.730> few<00:04:03.760> more<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:06.130> normally<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.640> might<00:04:06.880> spend<00:04:07.150> a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
a few more and normally I might spend a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.870 
a few more and normally I might spend a
little<00:04:07.420> more<00:04:07.720> time<00:04:08.019> with<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.530> do<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.920> more

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
little more time with it to do a more

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.690 
little more time with it to do a more
detailed<00:04:10.330> work<00:04:10.540> but<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.050> really<00:04:11.380> yeah<00:04:11.800> it's

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
detailed work but it's really yeah it's

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.759 
detailed work but it's really yeah it's
nice<00:04:12.970> when<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.390> very<00:04:13.540> loose<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.170> abstract

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
nice when it's very loose and abstract

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:15.850 
nice when it's very loose and abstract
so
