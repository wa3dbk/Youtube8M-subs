oh they would be small for me so it's
not<00:03:18.569> my<00:03:18.780> case<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.170> actually<00:03:19.409> when<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.370> bought<00:03:20.610> my

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
not my case I actually when I bought my

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.550 
not my case I actually when I bought my
pants<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.330> was<00:03:21.450> minor<00:03:21.629> it<00:03:21.930> was<00:03:22.049> in<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.379> world

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
pants I was minor it was in the world

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.759 
pants I was minor it was in the world
they<00:03:22.830> were<00:03:22.890> failing<00:03:23.220> good<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.650> cup<00:03:25.650> of

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
they were failing good but the cup of

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.190 
they were failing good but the cup of
people<00:03:26.099> say<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.879> you<00:03:27.150> should<00:03:27.330> buy<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.569> 20

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
people say that you should buy the 20

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800 
people say that you should buy the 20
inches<00:03:28.560> wider<00:03:29.209> don't<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.299> take<00:03:30.480> your<00:03:30.569> side

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
inches wider don't you take your side

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.710 
inches wider don't you take your side
than<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.140> actually<00:03:31.290> need<00:03:31.670> because<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:33.269> can

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
than you actually need because I can

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.899 
than you actually need because I can
notice<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.349> these<00:03:34.470> ones<00:03:34.739> at<00:03:34.950> 34<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.819> I

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
notice it that these ones at 34 and I

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.390 
notice it that these ones at 34 and I
actually<00:03:36.060> normally<00:03:36.599> by<00:03:36.750> 32<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.129> feel

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
actually normally by 32 and this feel

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.089 
actually normally by 32 and this feel
good<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:39.209> they're<00:03:39.659> not<00:03:39.840> different<00:03:40.049> at<00:03:40.950> all

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
good like they're not different at all

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.250 
good like they're not different at all
so<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.400> guess<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.909> 32<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.840> they<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.019> good

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
so I guess that I 32 and they are good

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.319 
so I guess that I 32 and they are good
for<00:03:43.440> me<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:43.799> it's<00:03:44.400> kind<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.700> tricky<00:03:45.030> maybe

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
for me so it's kind of tricky maybe

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.509 
for me so it's kind of tricky maybe
maybe<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.989> play<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.230> safe<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:47.190> should<00:03:47.370> maybe

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
maybe to play it safe you should maybe

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.039 
maybe to play it safe you should maybe
look<00:03:47.640> into<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.060> bigger<00:03:48.239> size<00:03:48.540> if<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:48.870> will

look into the bigger size if we will

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.569
