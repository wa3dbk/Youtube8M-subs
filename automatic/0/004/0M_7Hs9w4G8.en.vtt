00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hey people here is your matrix again 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 and this time with a battlefield 4 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.170
 easter egg and the tyrannosaurus 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.570
 Rex easter egg on flawed 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.000
 transfer of the easter egg is already 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 not quite the latest one anymore 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.300
 know already but I think there is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.859
 still many who do not know it and for 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 we show it here it is up 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.199
 cool in any case 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.010
 Now we start that way too 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.019
 Most important is you need two players 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 The first player will be with the tank 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 for faulty transfers then here 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.010
 to this excavator or shovel like 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 he always jumps on it, too 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 and then that he is on the backhoe 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.160
 it comes down to the tank or a chip 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 No matter the main thing comes on the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 Excavator on it and on the backhoe is one 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 Button the anger to the easter eggs 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.559
 so to speak , here he is here 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.769
 you can see well and the first person 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.479
 then lay down here and here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.070
 you could then press but you may 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.619
 stop alone does not need to press 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840
 two people and these buttons 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.890
 at the same time press now I show 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.570
 you guys still from jurassic park so to speak 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.990
 you know these goals from the first part 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.119
 through that one is, so to speak, only on the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.220
 tyrannosaurus rex easter egg come 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.630
 that something has to be here , of course 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.060
 I did not find that myself 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 I have searched many on the net for it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.079
 and everything and I have it on the net 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.450
 seen and want to show you have many 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.180
 seen videos in english i thought 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.720
 do something good in german 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 fly here right through equal 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:52.170
 I'm constantly over exactly 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 Here the trees will rustle here 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.229
 above and I do not think you know what 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.689
 but can look at everyone here 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.210
 if trees fall out when the terrace 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.950
 Exter there runs and screams so on 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.569
 best here then introduce yourself if it 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.519
 two press the buttons 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.290
 somewhere in this direction then and 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 then it could also be sawed , too 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.950
 to hear the noise 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.440
 Of course I have the noise here 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.760
 then there will be a little bit more 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.950
 reinforce that they hear it even better 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.590
 so now I'll show you the same 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.829
 second club and how to get there like that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.980
 the second button is here you can see it 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.579
 then on top of it on the bowl 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.620

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.860
 over at the excavator we push now 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.900
 perhaps the button and then the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.489
 next corner starts we are now 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.880

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.840
