00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:26.751
 When The Witcher 2 goes on sale is not yet known. We interviewed the developers, the level designer and the integration designer. 

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:36.672
 In the first Witcher, there was a lot of action, an amazing story and cool characters, but also a lot of sex. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.951
 How much sex will be in the second Witcher? 

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:46.754
 Yes. In the second Witcher there will be a lot of sex, but now we come to this question from the other side. 

00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:50.297
 We will not have sex cards, as in the first part. 

00:00:50.297 --> 00:01:01.616
 Sex is more connected with the plot. This time, emotions play an obvious important role. 

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:10.438
 It's not about just finding sex at once, doing it more often and harder, 

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:16.007
 We do not collect women, but this does not mean that it is impossible to have an affair. 

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.356
 Yes, sex is part of the world. You can always find a lady in the red light district. 

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:24.422
 It's not a problem. But sex is not the key part of the game. 

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:34.280
 A big role in the first part was played by the conflict between the races. Will the world now reign? 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.805
 Of course in Witcher 2 there will be conflicts between races ... 

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:46.519
 You can remember from the videos in the churchyard, there were elves ... 

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:53.130
 For sure. The conflict is still there and it is the core of the game world. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.376
 You understand that we just now canâ€™t take and end this conflict, because it will lead to huge changes in the world. 

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:04.126
 Now there are many confrontations and there will be even more. 

00:02:06.473 --> 00:02:13.226
 To the management of the first Witcher had to get used to. What happened to him now? 

00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:21.155
 First, we made it easier. We have created a completely new combat system. 

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:29.851
 We wanted to make it as complex as in the first Witcher, but more dynamic and spectacular. 

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:36.772
 There will also be two styles of struggle. Strong and fast. 

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:51.271
 But they can be mixed and in the end you get a group style. 

00:02:51.271 --> 00:03:04.168
 The main difference is that now you can only evade an attack at a certain time. 

00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:05.397
 If you dodge, you really dodge the blow. 

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:13.192
 The enemies have improved AI, there are fast opponents, and there are strong ones. 

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.808
 Enemies can use shields. 

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:23.268
 Either you direct the force to destroy the shield, or you try to outwit it and force it to open. 

00:03:23.268 --> 00:03:29.951
 Boevka easier, more interesting and spectacular 

00:03:31.614 --> 00:03:37.856
 The graphics in the witcher were amazing. But the new graphics engine looks even more realistic than its predecessor. 

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:41.433
 Can we also expect improvements in effects? 

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:44.908
 Of course. The graphics have changed completely. 

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:47.571
 We believe that Witcher 2 will be the most beautiful game of 2011. 

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:52.397
 For a start, we have a great engine and programmers. 

00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.839
 Secondly, we have great artists, the best! 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:03.623
 They can create very detailed characters and stunning locations. 

00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:07.362
 In the end, everything revolves around people. They are just very good. 

00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:09.619
 This is the reason why the game is so cool. 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:10.936
 And they love their work. 

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:15.934
 Want to say something to your fans? 

00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:25.648
 Of course. We love you! Wait for our game, it will be the best game! 

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.108
 Yes, we love games, you love games ... 

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:29.388
 And we love you. 

00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:31.014
 Thank!
