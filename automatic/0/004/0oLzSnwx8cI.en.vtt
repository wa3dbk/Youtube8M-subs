00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
figure because it really is I think this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.590

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
in my entire doctor your figure

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
in my entire doctor your figure

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.180 
collection it really does look
absolutely<00:02:08.069> brilliant<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:10.349> face<00:02:10.619> looks

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
absolutely brilliant the face looks

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.339 
absolutely brilliant the face looks
really<00:02:11.550> evil<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
really evil with a

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.300 
really evil with a
very<00:02:14.099> angry<00:02:14.670> facial<00:02:15.120> expression<00:02:15.719> we<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:15.870> see

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
very angry facial expression we can see

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.670 
very angry facial expression we can see
fangs<00:02:17.310> sticking<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:18.450> mouth<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:19.109> also

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
fangs sticking out of the mouth and also

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.979 
fangs sticking out of the mouth and also
some<00:02:20.400> cracks<00:02:20.790> around<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.389> face<00:02:21.569> as<00:02:21.780> well<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
some cracks around the face as well I

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.119 
some cracks around the face as well I
think<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:23.040> hair<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.639> the<00:02:24.540> same<00:02:25.129> hairstyle

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
think the hair is the same hairstyle

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.750 
think the hair is the same hairstyle
that<00:02:26.939> the<00:02:27.090> previous<00:02:27.569> weepy<00:02:28.469> Angels<00:02:28.889> have<00:02:29.549> had

that the previous weepy Angels have had
it's<00:02:30.060> been<00:02:30.269> very<00:02:30.569> nicely<00:02:30.810> sculpted<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.620> very

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
it's been very nicely sculpted and very

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.339 
it's been very nicely sculpted and very
nicely<00:02:32.159> painted<00:02:32.489> if<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.750> take<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> look<00:02:34.230> at

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
nicely painted if you take a look at

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.559 
nicely painted if you take a look at
this<00:02:34.469> item<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:35.129> clothing<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> middle<00:02:36.090> you

this item of clothing in the middle you
can<00:02:36.689> see<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:37.049> there's<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.290> massive<00:02:37.859> crack

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
can see that there's a massive crack

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.000 
can see that there's a massive crack
going<00:02:39.150> along<00:02:39.419> it<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.019> there's<00:02:40.169> also<00:02:40.349> lots<00:02:40.889> of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
going along it and there's also lots of

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.589 
going along it and there's also lots of
creases<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.849> make<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> look<00:02:42.150> very

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
creases on it to make it look very

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.520 
creases on it to make it look very
lifelike<00:02:43.219> I<00:02:44.219> really<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.999> the<00:02:45.389> sculpts<00:02:46.379> for

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530

turn 360 degrees on the shoulders you

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.360 
turn 360 degrees on the shoulders you
will<00:04:09.419> need<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.780> remove<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.409> wings<00:04:10.979> from<00:04:11.189> the

will need to remove the wings from the
body<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.909> then<00:04:12.780> they'll<00:04:13.199> be<00:04:13.379> able<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.799> turn

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
body and then they'll be able to turn

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:19.129 
body and then they'll be able to turn
like<00:04:15.449> that<00:04:15.919> the<00:04:16.919> arms<00:04:17.370> are<00:04:17.669> meant<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.030> turn<00:04:18.239> 360

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
like that the arms are meant to turn 360

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.259 
like that the arms are meant to turn 360
degrees<00:04:19.530> from<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.009> biceps<00:04:20.519> but

the shoulder and sadly the joint snapped
when<00:04:39.170> I<00:04:39.230> tried<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.800> turn<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:41.180> then<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.450> had<00:04:42.110> to

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
when I tried to turn and then I had to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.260 
when I tried to turn and then I had to
get<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.860> arm<00:04:43.820> superglue<00:04:44.510> back<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.020> body<00:04:45.200> I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
get the arm superglue back to the body I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.270 
get the arm superglue back to the body I
might<00:04:47.270> have<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.780> same<00:04:47.960> problem<00:04:48.020> with<00:04:49.010> this

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
might have the same problem with this

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.010 
might have the same problem with this
arm<00:04:49.550> if<00:04:49.700> I<00:04:49.820> tried<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.090> turn<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.480> because<00:04:50.750> as<00:04:50.900> you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
arm if I tried to turn it because as you

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.350 
arm if I tried to turn it because as you
can<00:04:51.140> see<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.590> can't<00:04:51.830> move<00:04:52.160> at<00:04:52.340> all<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:53.180> just

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
can see it can't move at all and it just

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.740 
can see it can't move at all and it just
bends<00:04:53.600> back<00:04:53.840> into<00:04:54.140> place<00:04:54.320> every<00:04:54.590> time<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:55.100> try

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
bends back into place every time I try

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.320

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
have a bit more articulation in the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.400 
have a bit more articulation in the
previous<00:05:15.500> two<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:16.610> legs<00:05:16.850> can<00:05:17.000> move<00:05:17.450> backwards

and forwards on the top they can move
outwards<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.140> bit<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:21.500> not<00:05:21.620> very<00:05:21.680> far<00:05:22.130> because

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
outwards a bit but not very far because

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.270 
outwards a bit but not very far because
the<00:05:22.640> dress<00:05:22.820> stops<00:05:23.150> them<00:05:23.360> from<00:05:23.390> doing<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:24.280> the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
the dress stops them from doing that the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
legs can bend at the knees and also the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.650 
legs can bend at the knees and also the
feets<00:05:28.130> can<00:05:28.430> swivel<00:05:28.700> 360<00:05:29.510> degrees<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:32.420> that's

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
feets can swivel 360 degrees and that's

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.150 
feets can swivel 360 degrees and that's
all<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:32.960> have<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.230> say<00:05:33.260> for<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.740> detailed
