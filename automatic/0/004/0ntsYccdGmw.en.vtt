00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
the sky out near Jupiter but take a look

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.100 
the sky out near Jupiter but take a look
at<00:04:23.669> how<00:04:23.789> that<00:04:24.030> could<00:04:24.210> easily<00:04:24.539> be<00:04:24.810> interpreted

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
at how that could easily be interpreted

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.909 
at how that could easily be interpreted
as<00:04:25.530> a

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
as a

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.290 
as a
through<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.069> legend<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.729> were<00:04:26.819> to<00:04:26.939> see<00:04:27.120> that

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
through a legend if you were to see that

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.730 
through a legend if you were to see that
in<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.509> sky<00:04:27.749> how<00:04:27.990> would<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.259> describe<00:04:28.620> that

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
in the sky how would you describe that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.860 
in the sky how would you describe that
if<00:04:29.039> we<00:04:29.159> had<00:04:29.310> no<00:04:29.490> internet<00:04:29.969> that<00:04:30.150> would<00:04:30.270> be<00:04:30.419> Hoey

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
if we had no internet that would be Hoey

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.989 
if we had no internet that would be Hoey
shooting<00:04:31.560> something<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.039> that<00:04:32.430> out<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.849> the

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
shooting something like that out of the

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.269 
shooting something like that out of the
sky<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:33.840> legend<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.289> Hoey<00:04:34.499> always<00:04:35.009> flows

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:35.279 
sky so the legend of Hoey always flows

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.890 
sky so the legend of Hoey always flows
back<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.789> commentary<00:04:36.270> fragments<00:04:36.810> I

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
back to the commentary fragments I

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.749 
back to the commentary fragments I
really<00:04:37.229> believe<00:04:37.529> this<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:38.039> it's<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.490> fragment

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
really believe this if it's a fragment

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.820 
really believe this if it's a fragment

now<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.669> is<00:04:41.819> interesting<00:04:41.969> at<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.569> exact

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
now this is interesting at the exact

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.769 
now this is interesting at the exact

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:27.749 
it's not going to be just some tiny

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:29.990 
it's not going to be just some tiny

whatever they said that was back many
millennia<00:05:32.400> ago<00:05:32.610> it<00:05:33.060> was<00:05:33.240> something<00:05:33.539> very

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
millennia ago it was something very

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.420 
millennia ago it was something very
special<00:05:34.080> on<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.439> sky<00:05:34.680> these<00:05:34.740> people<00:05:35.310> were

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
special on the sky these people were

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.499 
special on the sky these people were
more<00:05:35.639> in<00:05:35.789> tune<00:05:36.029> with<00:05:36.060> their<00:05:36.360> natural

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
more in tune with their natural

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.809 
more in tune with their natural
surroundings<00:05:37.169> and<00:05:37.349> we<00:05:37.500> will<00:05:37.650> ever<00:05:37.860> be<00:05:38.069> unless

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
surroundings and we will ever be unless

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.159 
surroundings and we will ever be unless
you<00:05:38.879> live<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.449> take<00:05:39.689> that<00:05:39.719> kind<00:05:40.110> of

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
you live and you take that kind of

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.679 
you live and you take that kind of
lifestyle<00:05:40.740> for<00:05:41.580> us<00:05:41.759> to<00:05:41.939> judge<00:05:42.180> them<00:05:42.389> and<00:05:42.569> say

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 
lifestyle for us to judge them and say

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.389 
lifestyle for us to judge them and say
oh<00:05:42.719> they<00:05:43.139> were<00:05:43.199> just<00:05:43.319> talking<00:05:43.589> about<00:05:43.830> planets

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:44.399 
oh they were just talking about planets

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.490 
oh they were just talking about planets
or<00:05:44.520> what<00:05:44.639> not<00:05:44.789> is<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.180> actually<00:05:46.139> kind<00:05:46.439> of

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
or what not is is actually kind of

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.619 
or what not is is actually kind of
demeaning<00:05:47.099> they<00:05:47.279> were<00:05:47.339> farm<00:05:47.759> greater<00:05:48.180> in<00:05:48.389> tune

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:48.629 
demeaning they were farm greater in tune

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.269 
demeaning they were farm greater in tune
with<00:05:48.779> our<00:05:48.930> natural<00:05:49.319> environment<00:05:49.830> than<00:05:49.949> we<00:05:50.099> are

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
with our natural environment than we are

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.490 
with our natural environment than we are
so<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.210> believe<00:05:51.539> their<00:05:51.689> stories<00:05:52.050> more<00:05:52.229> than<00:05:52.409> our

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
so I believe their stories more than our

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.829 
so I believe their stories more than our
own<00:05:52.649> right<00:05:52.860> now<00:05:53.039> so<00:05:53.520> keep<00:05:54.000> your<00:05:54.149> eyes<00:05:54.300> on<00:05:54.330> comet

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
own right now so keep your eyes on comet

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.959 
own right now so keep your eyes on comet
Ison<00:05:55.199> I<00:05:55.469> think<00:05:55.919> there's<00:05:56.099> two<00:05:56.279> ancient<00:05:56.699> myths

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
Ison I think there's two ancient myths

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.269 
Ison I think there's two ancient myths
and<00:05:57.180> stories<00:05:57.479> about<00:05:57.719> to<00:05:58.139> collide<00:05:58.529> at<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.039> same

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
and stories about to collide at the same

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.850 
and stories about to collide at the same
time<00:05:59.580> in<00:05:59.879> the<00:06:00.300> heavens<00:06:00.569> above<00:06:00.719> us<00:06:00.990> beginning

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
time in the heavens above us beginning

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.309

November 26 that we were witness going

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.959 
November 26 that we were witness going
