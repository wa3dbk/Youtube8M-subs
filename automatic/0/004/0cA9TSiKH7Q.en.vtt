00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
now on this light meter we have the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.340 
now on this light meter we have the
lumisphere<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.120> also<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> spot<00:00:52.050> meter

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
lumisphere and we also have a spot meter

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
lumisphere and we also have a spot meter
we'll<00:00:53.070> talk<00:00:53.309> about<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.969> second<00:00:55.730> with

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
we'll talk about that in a second with

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.110 
we'll talk about that in a second with
the<00:00:56.820> lumisphere<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.570> position<00:00:59.120> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the lumisphere in the up position it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080 
the lumisphere in the up position it
works<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> same<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.750> 308<00:01:01.559> did<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.789> mode

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
works the same as 308 did we have mode

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.690 
works the same as 308 did we have mode
which<00:01:04.019> changes<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:04.650> continuous<00:01:05.250> light<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
which changes from continuous light to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.170 
which changes from continuous light to
strobe<00:01:05.970> light<00:01:07.369> when<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> press<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.760> down

strobe light when you press that down

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.980 
strobe light when you press that down
you'll<00:01:09.689> turn<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.080> dial<00:01:11.119> clockwise<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you'll turn this dial clockwise to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 
you'll turn this dial clockwise to
change<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> setting<00:01:14.360> we're<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> keep

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
change the setting we're going to keep

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.190 
change the setting we're going to keep
it<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.020> continuous<00:01:16.560> mode<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it on continuous mode again you have a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.280 
it on continuous mode again you have a
memory<00:01:19.560> Clear<00:01:19.979> button<00:01:20.600> which<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.869> option

if<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:23.400> ISO<00:01:23.850> save<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
if you have one ISO save and then a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.109 
if you have one ISO save and then a
different<00:01:24.689> ISO<00:01:25.200> saved<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.460> would<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> if

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
different ISO saved you would do that if

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.899 
different ISO saved you would do that if
you<00:01:27.240> had<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:27.810> cameras<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.670> working

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you had two cameras that you're working

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.170 
you had two cameras that you're working
on<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> studio<00:01:30.680> again<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:32.430> ISO<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
on in the studio again your ISO is in

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.649 
on in the studio again your ISO is in
the<00:01:33.329> top<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.810> corner<00:01:35.270> your<00:01:36.270> shutter<00:01:36.570> speed

position down here we have a cap over
the<00:01:44.700> PC<00:01:45.119> terminal<00:01:45.619> when<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.189> we

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the PC terminal when we take that off we

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
the PC terminal when we take that off we
can<00:01:47.579> still<00:01:47.790> see<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.290> we

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
can still see that we have this like we

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.789 
can still see that we have this like we
did<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> 308<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:51.630> plug<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.170> strobe<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.649> we

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
did on the 308 to plug in a strobe if we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.789 
did on the 308 to plug in a strobe if we
decided<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.990> let's<00:01:54.990> start<00:01:55.229> by<00:01:55.380> setting<00:01:55.439> our

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
decided to let's start by setting our

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.109 
decided to let's start by setting our
ISO<00:01:57.590> for<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.740> tutorial<00:01:59.280> let's<00:01:59.490> set<00:01:59.670> our<00:01:59.759> ISO

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
ISO for this tutorial let's set our ISO

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.200 
ISO for this tutorial let's set our ISO
to<00:02:00.180> 400<00:02:01.009> we're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> turn<00:02:02.399> our<00:02:02.460> dial

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
to 400 we're going to turn our dial

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.510 
to 400 we're going to turn our dial
Conor<00:02:03.630> clockwise<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:06.329> 400<00:02:07.009> again<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.310> light

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.700 
Conor clockwise to 400 again these light
meters<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:08.970> set<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> third<00:02:09.539> stop<00:02:09.869> difference

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
meters are set to third stop difference

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.080 
meters are set to third stop difference
as<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.980> can<00:02:11.100> see<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.460> I<00:02:11.580> hold<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.910> button

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
see your ISO changes in third steps so

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.940 
see your ISO changes in third steps so
this<00:03:55.740> number<00:03:55.970> 25.6<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.390> 10th<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.990> changing

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
it's one third of a stop so if we went

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.940 
it's one third of a stop so if we went
