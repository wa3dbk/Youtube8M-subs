00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.410 

this<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.030> possibility<00:02:53.190> summersisle

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
this is a possibility summersisle

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.350 
this is a possibility summersisle
because<00:02:55.420> it's<00:02:56.110> high<00:02:56.680> elves<00:02:57.069> which<00:02:57.400> i<00:02:57.670> think<00:02:57.700> is

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
because it's high elves which i think is

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.039 
because it's high elves which i think is
part<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.900> foul<00:03:01.900> more<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:04.630> they

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
part of the foul more so that that they

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.729 
part of the foul more so that that they
tyne<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.620> quite<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.860> bit<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:07.530> civil<00:03:08.530> war

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
tyne are quite a bit to the civil war

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.069 
tyne are quite a bit to the civil war
that's<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.070> on<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.489> Skyrim<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.239> that's<00:03:10.900> a

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
that's going on in Skyrim so that's a

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:21.930 
that's going on in Skyrim so that's a
possibility<00:03:15.810> hi<00:03:16.810> rock<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:20.700> Britain's<00:03:21.700> and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
possibility hi rock is Britain's and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.720 
possibility hi rock is Britain's and
talks<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.950> don't<00:03:24.340> really<00:03:24.760> hear<00:03:25.269> much<00:03:25.329> about

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
talks we don't really hear much about

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.240 
talks we don't really hear much about
them<00:03:27.730> in<00:03:28.720> Skyrim<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:31.680> think<00:03:32.680> they're<00:03:33.010> out<00:03:33.220> of

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
them in Skyrim so I think they're out of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.870 
them in Skyrim so I think they're out of
the<00:03:33.370> question<00:03:33.549> for<00:03:33.850> these<00:03:34.239> changes<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.840> bread

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the question for these changes to bread

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.380 
the question for these changes to bread
so<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.030> leaves<00:03:37.239> us<00:03:37.480> with<00:03:38.940> Valon<00:03:39.940> wood<00:03:40.150> and

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
so that leaves us with Valon wood and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.789 
so that leaves us with Valon wood and
elsewhere<00:03:42.329> Valon<00:03:43.329> would<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.870> don't<00:03:44.590> know<00:03:44.680> what

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
elsewhere Valon would I don't know what

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.120 
elsewhere Valon would I don't know what
that's<00:03:45.010> home<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.420> ellenwood<00:03:46.799> Bosma<00:03:47.799> which<00:03:47.980> is

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
that's home to ellenwood Bosma which is

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.970 
that's home to ellenwood Bosma which is
the<00:03:48.250> wood<00:03:48.459> elves<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.810> think<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.470> could<00:03:50.920> be

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
the wood elves so I think that could be

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.949 
the wood elves so I think that could be
in<00:03:51.310> as<00:03:51.430> well<00:03:51.609> because<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.000> think<00:03:52.120> they're<00:03:52.630> in

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
in as well because I think they're in

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.520 
in as well because I think they're in
the<00:03:54.030> Thalmor<00:03:55.030> as<00:03:55.180> well<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.480> don't<00:03:55.660> know<00:03:55.930> if<00:03:56.230> dark

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
the Thalmor as well I don't know if dark

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.199 
the Thalmor as well I don't know if dark
elves<00:03:56.890> are<00:03:57.100> but<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:58.319> think<00:03:59.319> tiles<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.760> what

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
elves are but I think tiles and what

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.460 
elves are but I think tiles and what
else<00:04:01.859> definitely<00:04:02.859> hopefully<00:04:03.819> probably<00:04:04.269> ah

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
else definitely hopefully probably ah

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.949 
else definitely hopefully probably ah
i'm<00:04:05.470> not<00:04:05.739> really<00:04:05.950> have<00:04:06.250> most<00:04:06.959> knowledgeable

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
i'm not really have most knowledgeable

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.430 
i'm not really have most knowledgeable
about<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.680> elder<00:04:08.920> scrolls<00:04:08.950> but<00:04:09.639> I<00:04:09.910> know<00:04:10.450> yeah

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
about the elder scrolls but I know yeah

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.770 
about the elder scrolls but I know yeah
and<00:04:12.100> this<00:04:12.370> needs<00:04:12.580> elsewhere<00:04:12.850> home<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.630> key

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
and this needs elsewhere home to the key

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.670 
and this needs elsewhere home to the key
genes<00:04:18.299> dividing<00:04:19.299> us<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.690> advantage<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.500> the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
genes dividing us the advantage to the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.320 
genes dividing us the advantage to the
north<00:04:20.920> animal<00:04:21.370> probably<00:04:21.610> a<00:04:21.760> sub<00:04:22.090> tropical

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
north animal probably a sub tropical

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.000 
north animal probably a sub tropical
zone<00:04:22.870> in<00:04:23.700> South<00:04:24.700> this<00:04:25.210> region<00:04:25.750> Max's<00:04:26.110> son<00:04:26.470> so

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
zone in South this region Max's son so

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.730 
zone in South this region Max's son so
the<00:04:27.070> coast<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.820> Tamriel<00:04:28.390> elsewhere<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.530> home

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
the coast of Tamriel elsewhere is home

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.420 
the coast of Tamriel elsewhere is home
to<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:29.950> coogi<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.380> think<00:04:32.440> it's<00:04:32.890> going<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.370> be

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
to the coogi so I think it's going to be

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.370 
to the coogi so I think it's going to be
one<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.730> these<00:04:33.970> three<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:37.020> there's<00:04:38.020> three

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
one of these three I there's three

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.760 
one of these three I there's three
possibilities<00:04:38.740> there<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:43.210> thing<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.560> it

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
possibilities there the thing that it

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.430 
possibilities there the thing that it
could<00:04:44.980> be<00:04:45.510> I'm<00:04:46.510> anything<00:04:47.020> is<00:04:47.140> going<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.350> be

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
could be I'm anything is going to be

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.520 
could be I'm anything is going to be
these<00:04:47.560> free<00:04:47.830> basis<00:04:48.280> because<00:04:49.030> we've<00:04:49.270> seen<00:04:49.570> all

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
these free basis because we've seen all

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.090 
these free basis because we've seen all
of<00:04:50.590> these<00:04:50.950> one<00:04:51.670> circle<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.210> black<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:53.100> high

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
of these one circle in black and high

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.990 
of these one circle in black and high
rock<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:55.740> Britons<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.920> walks<00:04:57.250> they<00:04:57.670> haven't

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
rock and Britons and walks they haven't

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.960 
rock and Britons and walks they haven't
really<00:04:58.180> been<00:04:58.450> in<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.810> story<00:04:59.410> much<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:01.170> Skyrim

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
really been in the story much in Skyrim

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.340 
really been in the story much in Skyrim
haven't<00:05:03.970> been<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.240> story<00:05:04.510> much<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:05.080> then

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
haven't been in the story much so then

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.320 
haven't been in the story much so then
already<00:05:05.740> tied<00:05:05.950> into<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.430> story<00:05:06.730> so<00:05:07.180> we

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
already tied into the story so we

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.820 
already tied into the story so we
couldn't<00:05:07.510> really<00:05:07.630> get<00:05:07.990> much<00:05:08.230> out<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.530> these

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
couldn't really get much out of these

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
couldn't really get much out of these
guys<00:05:10.530> so<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.770> two<00:05:12.010> elves<00:05:13.530> elven<00:05:14.530> regions<00:05:15.040> they

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
guys so the two elves elven regions they

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:23.460 
guys so the two elves elven regions they
link<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.419> Skyrim<00:05:19.830> unless<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.010> don't<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:22.470> but

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
link to Skyrim unless you don't and but

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.920 
link to Skyrim unless you don't and but
elsewhere<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.090> think<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.480> reason<00:05:25.630> they

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
elsewhere I that I think the reason they

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.200 
elsewhere I that I think the reason they
people<00:05:26.530> talking<00:05:27.010> about<00:05:27.100> this<00:05:27.460> is<00:05:28.650> because<00:05:30.210> we

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
people talking about this is because we

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.470 
people talking about this is because we
haven't<00:05:31.570> seen<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.870> region<00:05:32.470> like<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.919> before

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
haven't seen a region like this before

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.740 
haven't seen a region like this before
this<00:05:34.480> is<00:05:34.660> like<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.840> tropical<00:05:35.200> ISM<00:05:36.270> region<00:05:37.270> like

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
this is like a tropical ISM region like

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.890 
this is like a tropical ISM region like
Deborah<00:05:38.740> see<00:05:38.950> like<00:05:39.400> jungle<00:05:39.790> trees<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.630> stuff

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
Deborah see like jungle trees and stuff

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.010 
Deborah see like jungle trees and stuff
so<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.830> will<00:05:42.100> be<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.220> brand-new<00:05:42.730> thing<00:05:43.600> we<00:05:43.840> can

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
so that will be a brand-new thing we can

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.900

question<00:06:18.580> because<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.570> hasn't<00:06:19.690> been<00:06:19.900> linked

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
question because it hasn't been linked

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.420 
question because it hasn't been linked
into<00:06:20.530> skyrim<00:06:20.800> Black<00:06:21.610> Marsh

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
the Dark Elves don't really have much do

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.350 
the Dark Elves don't really have much do
ask<00:06:26.830> irony<00:06:27.310> ver<00:06:27.370> so<00:06:27.789> that's<00:06:28.000> out<00:06:28.180> of<00:06:28.210> the

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
ask irony ver so that's out of the

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.110

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
question Sierra deal with hide I'm

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.230 
question Sierra deal with hide I'm
affair<00:06:31.449> with<00:06:31.599> hide<00:06:32.219> morrowind<00:06:33.219> with<00:06:33.400> hide<00:06:33.639> and

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
affair with hide morrowind with hide and

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.909 
affair with hide morrowind with hide and
these<00:06:34.599> three<00:06:36.150> tie<00:06:37.150> in<00:06:37.349> quite<00:06:38.349> a<00:06:38.379> lot<00:06:38.620> with<00:06:38.830> the

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
these three tie in quite a lot with the

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.089 
these three tie in quite a lot with the
skyrim<00:06:39.189> story<00:06:40.050> so<00:06:41.050> i<00:06:41.080> think<00:06:41.199> these<00:06:41.500> three<00:06:41.860> and

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
skyrim story so i think these three and

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:44.610 
skyrim story so i think these three and
the<00:06:42.340> possibilities<00:06:42.969> we<00:06:43.210> could<00:06:43.419> see<00:06:43.750> in<00:06:44.439> the

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
the possibilities we could see in the

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.709 
the possibilities we could see in the
next<00:06:44.830> elder<00:06:45.250> scrolls<00:06:46.650> but<00:06:47.650> like<00:06:48.639> ice-1<00:06:48.849> said

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
next elder scrolls but like ice-1 said

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.749 
next elder scrolls but like ice-1 said
this<00:06:49.900> but<00:06:50.169> i<00:06:50.439> think<00:06:51.250> they've<00:06:51.430> just<00:06:51.610> finished

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
this but i think they've just finished

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.480 
this but i think they've just finished
up<00:06:52.090> on<00:06:52.300> the<00:06:52.419> skyrim<00:06:52.750> dlc<00:06:52.990> and<00:06:53.530> I<00:06:54.009> think<00:06:54.370> they

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
up on the skyrim dlc and I think they

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.170 
up on the skyrim dlc and I think they
finished<00:06:54.789> up<00:06:56.069> making<00:06:57.069> the<00:06:57.279> vanilla<00:06:58.060> game<00:06:58.449> of

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
finished up making the vanilla game of

finished up making the vanilla game of
own<00:07:01.180> Scrolls<00:07:01.599> online<00:07:01.779> so<00:07:02.319> what's<00:07:02.529> the<00:07:02.620> thing

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740

that<00:07:02.949> they're<00:07:03.069> going<00:07:03.159> to<00:07:03.219> do<00:07:03.340> they're<00:07:03.520> going

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
that they're going to do they're going

that they're going to do they're going
to<00:07:03.699> release<00:07:03.819> everything<00:07:04.210> they<00:07:04.419> want<00:07:04.569> to

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:04.659 
to release everything they want to

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.149 
to release everything they want to

release the elder scrolls online and

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.379 
release the elder scrolls online and
