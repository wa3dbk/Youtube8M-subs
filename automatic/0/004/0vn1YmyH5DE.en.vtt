00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.440 

I<00:00:01.290> think<00:00:02.010> it's<00:00:02.190> really<00:00:02.460> unpredictable<00:00:03.000> and

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.450 
I think it's really unpredictable and

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.090 
I think it's really unpredictable and
that's<00:00:03.600> what<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:03.810> got<00:00:04.170> from<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.560> first<00:00:04.800> reading

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
that's what I got from the first reading

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.280 
that's what I got from the first reading
of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.490> script<00:00:05.850> that<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:07.109> know<00:00:07.230> you

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
of the script that you you know you

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.160 
of the script that you you know you
really<00:00:07.620> don't<00:00:07.890> know<00:00:08.160> what's<00:00:08.690> what's<00:00:09.690> coming

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
really don't know what's what's coming

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.699 
really don't know what's what's coming
and<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.059> I'm<00:00:12.059> sure<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.869> audience<00:00:13.020> will<00:00:13.469> feel

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
and and I'm sure the audience will feel

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.920 
and and I'm sure the audience will feel
they're<00:00:14.010> not<00:00:14.219> quite<00:00:14.549> sure<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.850> Bill<00:00:15.420> Bill's

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
they're not quite sure of Bill Bill's

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.279 
they're not quite sure of Bill Bill's
position<00:00:17.089> and<00:00:18.089> who<00:00:18.300> he<00:00:18.509> really<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.199> if

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
position and who he really is and if

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.089 
position and who he really is and if
he's<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.679> bad<00:00:19.830> guy<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.589> that's<00:00:22.919> what

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
he's the bad guy and I think that's what

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.179 
he's the bad guy and I think that's what
will<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.400> compelling<00:00:23.849> about<00:00:24.060> about<00:00:24.749> the<00:00:24.900> movie

on<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.619> same<00:01:06.800> flights<00:01:07.190> together<00:01:07.670> it's<00:01:07.970> it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
on the same flights together it's it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.930 
on the same flights together it's it
seems<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.080> seems<00:01:09.350> quite<00:01:09.500> obvious<00:01:09.940> between

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
seems that seems quite obvious between

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.830 
seems that seems quite obvious between
them<00:01:11.119> at<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.330> start<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.960> think<00:01:12.550> she<00:01:13.750> she<00:01:14.750> is

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
them at the start I think she she is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.320 
them at the start I think she she is
possibly<00:01:15.080> witnessed<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:16.039> few<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.399> his<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.270> know

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
possibly witnessed a few of his you know

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.800 
possibly witnessed a few of his you know
drunken<00:01:17.990> states<00:01:18.440> on<00:01:18.920> flights<00:01:19.520> she<00:01:20.030> she's

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
drunken states on flights she she's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.340 
drunken states on flights she she's
aware<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.170> his<00:01:21.590> issues<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:23.869> guess<00:01:24.140> that's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
aware of his issues so I guess that's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.460 
aware of his issues so I guess that's
why<00:01:24.530> she<00:01:25.310> becomes<00:01:25.670> someone<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:26.300> he<00:01:26.570> reaches

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
why she becomes someone that he reaches

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.420 
why she becomes someone that he reaches
out<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.649> as<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> as<00:01:28.460> an<00:01:29.179> ally
