00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.810
 no when traveling with ifi 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.920
 In this episode I show you how 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.990
 you taste this look with an egg and 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.459
 inside wok vegetables and this is one 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.379
 clean evening meal 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.880
 very quickly within fifteen minutes baby of 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.390
 ready this is what you need for the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.279
 wrap slash pizza coarsely sliced bread 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.660
 vegetables and I have provincial here 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.339
 taken of course you can any other 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.220
 wok vegetables take what you want 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:30.079
 Albert Heijn also has a very large wok 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.029
 vegetable bags in the freezer that is 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.010
 a lot cheaper than this one 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.780
 in addition, fetta cheese or white cheese 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.940
 here have two eggs 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 it's one egg per app so if you like 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.800
 multiple wraps then you have multiple 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.329
 ends needed and still passata I have 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.289
 just taken the ah basic that is 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.030
 totally fine 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.800
 the first thing you are going to do is the egg 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.519
 knock 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.870
 and i always do one egg every time i do 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.699
 know if you say but you can of course 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.260
 do the rows together like you do 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.640
 with the order just then but I like it a lot 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.109
 harder to rule and if i have it 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.120
 just do it individually then I just know 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.829
 that he is a wrap here do 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.030
 I am a little salty 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:13.490
 to test bit by taste 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:15.680
 bring the peter yard and see what you get 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.780
 tasty myself I find garlic powder there 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.740
 pretty tasty too 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.840
 actually i'm doing it for the first time 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.480
 but look pretty good on me 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 and parsley also a little bit with it 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.200
 next step is the usefulness of 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.200
 a lot of time to blackout 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.110
 if everything is mixed well, the protein 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.900
 and warm a frying pan over medium heat 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.270
 and add some photos I use now 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.270
 just speak my olive oil 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:03.500
 before pan is hot for you 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:07.729
 the end at well look with a flat in it 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.709
 immediately and inside and then you can do this there 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.069
 like a kind of pancakes 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.069
 around it 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.880
 will you just always xena just a joke 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.100
 lesson it happens by minutes 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.569
 of course never 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.860
 you actually dedicate very quickly so me 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.720
 the bee would remain as the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.290
 top is on behavior then you grab it 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.400
 or pancake knife or really such a flat 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 kitchen help 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.620
 and then you can do it quite easily 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:44.000
 and of course when you do it again for 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:46.970
 a camera that's not god go away 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.350
 then get it 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.350
 in principle , of course, it always goes 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.030
 good except if you have fat filming with the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.739
 second egg exactly the same as with 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.720
 first buy ice cream loose in her 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.459
 glass and look this is already going much better 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.440
 because in the middle stick and us 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.890
 which dried up in the balkans 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.660
 then turn it easy and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.410
 this should still really quite a minute 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.090
 fast 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.480
 post hold half of the wok vegetables 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.760
 going into the trap and luring me through the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.769
 hell 20 is 400 grams and the sphinx each 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.540
 getting your on it's just too much 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.120
 so I do half of it and possibly 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.120
 I eat the respawn what ate 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.890
 if you like nice tv this also taste 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.660
 bring with some salt and herbs 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.580
 First I would put no onions company 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.810
 and girls mix or sugar in on one 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.540
 other form of sugar 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.610
 so it's best to just do it yourself 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.050
 but so things there 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.050
 you don't know what you drink 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.370
 I'm just doing a little bit 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.810
 the same spices salt and pepper 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.810
 as what for the website use 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.329
 also called is ready I must do is 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.980
 actually that fit was there in one 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.480
 separate you pennies 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.299
 all too often used what 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.879
 then doing is possible and so what you do 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.530
 led normal peach would do 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.340
 and frankly you would be pretty okay 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.730
 lots of wraps 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.079
 can still warm up once but the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.759
 other side i think you know the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.759
 vegetables is also just an alarm 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.530
 So the king will be fine over 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:35.080
 as in itself also a bit through 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:38.680
 for heat a lot and then the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.479
 I will wok here with you too 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.490
 really like a serious pizza 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.610
 investors then cheese on top 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.780
 melt and then add some vegetables to whatever you like 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.639
 delicious yourself 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.430
 pain finds different meat is so 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.289
 white cheese must of course still be added 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.970
 I now cut a bit or off 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.229
 I think around about 20 or so well 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.610
 something like that 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.169
 and i used to know wendy 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.599
 proposals but very seriously in the past 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.340
 really just the case for block or something 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.099
 to about paste 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.530
 effing believer pulchritudinous super high 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.930
 so when do you break a piece like that? 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:21.220
 just doing less than I crumble that 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:23.229
 about wraps empty pizza thing I have you 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.330
 which yes with the pizza this is more up 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.830
 actually a pizza but you can have this 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.360
 use the soil of course 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.180
 for a pizza you might have to mind 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.650
 so that you are a bit fatter 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.349
 every now and then women a double well looks 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.760
 really beautiful from wet and finally must 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.120
 I also, of course, for a little while 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120
 taste 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.990
 so good 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.780
 I hope that therefore always went product 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.780
 kick boxer 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.990
 it curls very well and it is not like that 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.970
 very heavy on the stomach or so and you can 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.590
 quite a long way ahead so let me 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.390

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.090
 until next week 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.280
 but what i saw when i read the book and 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.080
 that was very many things that six there 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.700
 is scientific research at 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.250
 or there are experts who talk about that 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.250
 and I asked her about it
