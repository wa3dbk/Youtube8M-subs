00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.790
 I'm going to teach how to do 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.710
 tools ingredients and equipment that 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.810
 we will use today I have some sticks for 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
 pallets a pair of balls for pallets of 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.009
 ready-made cakes if they do not have a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.960
 excellent recipe and technique to make 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.059
 these balls for cake palettes 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.550
 I'll leave a link for our recipe and 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.230
 tutorial on our channel I have a little 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.059
 of melted white chocolate that I've 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.190
 had green 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.679
 I must mention to you that for all of these 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.629
 princesses who see here do not use candies 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.760
 melted use white chocolate 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.890
 melted dyed in different colors 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.379
 so I'll leave you in the description 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.539
 about the colors I use 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.030
 used gel or powder coloring 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.489
 I never used liquid dye when I 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.710
 try coloring white chocolate I have 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.899
 some tape to glue I have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.449
 some printed figures that I found in 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.909
 I'm going to leave the link in the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.189
 descriptive space of this tutorial and 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.300
 I have cut out in advance what I am going to 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.700
 use today 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.700
 that of Princess Tiana one of the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 princesses and the frog 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 when they cut out their printed figures 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.780
 make sure to trim the body up 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.450
 the waist leaving out the entire skirt 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.720
 because the paddle balls are going to be 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.090
 the skirts of the princesses as a 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.790
 extra detail I have bright powder 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.180
 edible gold and silver a little 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.370
 water and a brush can be used to 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 achieve that brilliant effect they see 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.430
 on the skirt this is completely 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.820
 optional but it gives a very nice touch 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.190
 to the skirt 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.650
 to start I want to show you these 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.110
 two balls for cake palettes I'm going to 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.479
 use this big this is the ball of 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.490
 standard size for cake pallets and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.310
 this is about the size of a ball of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.140
 golf so it's a little bigger I've 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.540
 made of this size because I want 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.910
 make sure to achieve a wide skirt 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.130
 for the princess dress and not a 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.770
 thin and small so I'm going to take 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.070
 this big ball well round and you 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.420
 I'm going to give a shape like a cone 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.270
 I'm just being a bit of a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.130
 side to side in the palms of my hands 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.010
 until I achieve a nice similar shape 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.500
 to a cone now I put it in the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.810
 refrigerator for 15 minutes so that it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.090
 firm before putting the stick 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.010
 of palette or anything else from 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.410
 way that when you enter the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.540
 stick on top not going to crush it 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.060
 and lose its form 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.430
 to save time I have here a 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.069
 ball that I have prepared previously and that 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.689
 it has already cooled down I have already wet the tip 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.819
 from my pallette stick in a bit of 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.859
 melted white chocolate and what 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.109
 I entered by the top of the 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.299
 cake palette ball and I took it 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.370
 again to the refrigerator by others 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.879
 five minutes to dry and seal 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.099
 well it 's time to submerge already I should also 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.769
 to mention that here I have a bit of 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.290
 waxed paper which will serve us 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.349
 to put to dry our palette 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.079
 cake now I take my little piana and a 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.870
 little piece of tape to paste like 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.389
 do this first because once they have 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.329
 submerged that cake palette have to 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.169
 work pretty fast to attach to 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.659
 your princess 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.359
 so I grab a bit of this tape 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:34.180
 to stick and I put it on the back of 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.120
 tiana and bent the rest of the tape towards 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.120
 I'm going to paste it in here to have it 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.459
 by hand when I need it I like to use 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.919
 a deep container to submerge the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.630
 cake palette and I had it green 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.240
 because her dress in this 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.370
 printed cut is that color so 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.040
 I use the colors of the dresses of the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.870
 princesses in these images I put to the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.920
 cake palette ball until the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.960
 background and I flip it from one side to the other 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.190
 making sure to cover it all up to the 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.800
 chocolate stamp and then I take it out the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.740
 I put on the waxed paper and can 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.080
 see that he pushed her a little to create that 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.139
 cute turn in her dress skirt 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.530
 vaporous of the princess 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.139
 now I take tiana and using the tape 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.479
 to paste the paste here on the 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.639
 stick of the palette working from his 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.919
 back the reason why I do it from 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.409
 this way is because I want to do it 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.509
 while the chocolate is wet because 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.180
 I want the princess's hands 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.150
 stick on your skirt that's what I've 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.849
 done with these little princesses can see 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.759
 that ariel's hands are stuck 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.889
 on her skirt and that's going to help 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.590
 hold in place 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.319
 so paste it this way trying 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.050
 of aligning it with your waist and bending 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.060
 the tape to paste back here is not 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.009
 worry if they have excess tape 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.259
 on this shore they can cut it 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.349
 after it has dried completely 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.479
 let it dry completely and then if 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.150
 they want they can put a little glaze 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.479
 in an airtight bag and make some 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.159
 figures if you like but as I said 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.830
 they also have the option of putting 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.379
 edible shine I have chosen to put 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.800
 silver shine the edible shine is 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.409
 get in most stores 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.690
 If you want to add the brightness, wait for 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:31.050
 that the chocolate is completely dry 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.319
 they pass the wet brush in a little 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.319
 of water 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.110
 do not throw too much 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.590
 and simply with your fingers remove the 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.620
 excess water only need a slight 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.990
 wet layer and then with your fingers well 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.780
 dry they take a little bit of their shine 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.540
 edible just a little bit and sprayed 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.310
 on the skirt from a certain height the 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.620
 why I do not put the brightness 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.690
 while the chocolate is still wet it is 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.430
 because the brightness sinks inside the 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.590
 chocolate and they have to use a lot 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.960
 quantity the edible brightness is 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.300
 quite expensive so this is a 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.630
 way to save it and get the 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.780
 better results so there they have 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.570
 her beautiful shiny skirt and here they have 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.480
 tiana with her other princess friends 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.270
 of disney and if you want to turn them into 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.460
 some beautiful identifiers for mass 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.470
 simply print small 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.780
 tabs with the names of their 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.390
 guests and they open some small 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.060
 holes to put them in the sticks 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.670
 of the palette also have the option of 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.460
 deliver them as souvenirs of your party 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.529
 in your cotillones or in a tray of 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.479
 pallets or pacifiers 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:50.669
 the paper I use to print the 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:53.489
 images is a cardboard 210 g sm like this 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:56.309
 that is not a common role is a bit more 

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:58.579
 thick and firmer than a simple sheet 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:07:01.619
 of paper if you love our
