 homemade moisturizer in this case les 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.619
 I bring the easiest and fastest method 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 of doing and we're going to make this cream with 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.140
 sweet almond oil and oil 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.050
 grape nugget so let's go with the list 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 of materials to make our cream 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 humectant 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 we need a clean little boat spoons 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.690
 to measure essence of your preference that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.300
 it's optional 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.519
 petrolatum grape seed oil oil 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.829
 of sweet almonds and rose water 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.050
 remember that the description of the video will 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.079
 I leave the complete list of materials and 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.860
 where I bought them first let's mix 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 60 milliliters water bath oil 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 grape seed 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.790
 and 60 ml of sweet almond oil 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.400
 then we are going to add 2 tablespoons 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 Vaseline Tureens 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.979
 These two oils are excellent for 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.740
 moisturize the skin are soft and are not 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.840
 fatty we wait for him to join 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 everything is very important that the oils 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 do not boil and only warm 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.190
 then we add 50 milliliters of water 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.040
 of roses 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.250
 you can replace it with distilled water and 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.650
 we add it little by little using a blender 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.830
 this is so that the water is incorporated 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.200
 with the oils and the cream is formed here 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.320
 is where we can put the essence I 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.880
 I put a floral scent that is optional 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.860
 You must beat until you have one 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.860
 creamy and white consistency 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.880
