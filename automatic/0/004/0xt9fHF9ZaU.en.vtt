00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.689
 and so another one of the open varieties 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.320
 ground 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.980
 variety super determinant red 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.759
 cap 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.039
 very very compact all pressed to 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.830
 the center is therefore very easy it 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.650
 tie up literally in one place he 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.019
 keeps well and all the fruits of it 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.140
 medium medium size up to 100 grams 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.110
 huddled here is a bunch and forms here 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.240
 such a hat as you see which 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.530
 The idea of â€‹â€‹course should blush but I 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.780
 while the lower brush has reddened 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.070
 starts but i think will turn red and and above 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.570
 that is, care requires little 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.970
 enough fruitful variety just for 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.820
 open ground super determinant 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.920
 a variety that mostly tries and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.060
 grow in open ground precisely in 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.400
 our so to say middle latitudes or 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.829
 northern more northern latitudes 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.729
 since tall varieties grow y 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:13.340
 us in the open field is problematic 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.070
 Here such varieties grow always be with 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.609
 harvest even out auspicious year in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.320
 during 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.619
 red hats as I said super 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.340
 determinant 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.490
 the court is very compact and therefore here such 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.439
 here are not very large fruits form but 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:37.659
 happens of course bigger but on average 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:40.520
 this is the most average look here 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.479
 Standard fine pilaf with good 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.479
 internal 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:53.149
 content naturally such fruits have 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:57.429
 already more family of legs here but they 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.429
 but more juicy and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.340
 its magnitude naturally allows it 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.469
 canned in any containers that is 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.629
 even in large banks you can 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:14.629
 canned salt it fine 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.390
 wonderful tomatoes about the yield he eats 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.579
 as you saw and Cochin bush good 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.579
 quite a grade
