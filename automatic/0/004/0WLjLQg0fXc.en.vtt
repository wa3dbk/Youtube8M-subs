editing with the most advanced hardware
available<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.829> becomes<00:00:59.219> easier<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> faster

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

for<00:01:00.420> them<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> work<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
for them to work but if you are a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
for them to work but if you are a
creative<00:01:02.579> user<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.140> Mac

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
creative user you would think this Mac

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
creative user you would think this Mac
Pro<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.189> me<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.580> doesn't<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Pro is not for me it doesn't have a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
Pro is not for me it doesn't have a
screen<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.890> costs<00:01:08.250> three<00:01:08.490> thousand

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
screen and it costs three thousand

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
screen and it costs three thousand
dollars<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.869> imac<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.409> example<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
dollars and the imac for example has a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.179 
dollars and the imac for example has a
screen<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:12.060> probably<00:01:12.330> fast<00:01:13.140> enough<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
screen it's probably fast enough and the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.370 
screen it's probably fast enough and the
best<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.520> costs<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.060> thousand<00:01:15.450> dollars<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
best one costs two thousand dollars so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530 
best one costs two thousand dollars so
should<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.159> imac<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
should you go for a imac right now you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
should you go for a imac right now you
can<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:18.900> say<00:01:19.170> buying<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> mac<00:01:19.860> pro<00:01:20.040> major

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
can also say buying the mac pro major

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640 
can also say buying the mac pro major
future-proof<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> next<00:01:21.780> four<00:01:22.020> years<00:01:22.290> or

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
future-proof for the next four years or

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
future-proof for the next four years or
more<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> imac<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:25.229> probably

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
more as for the imac it would probably

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.640 
more as for the imac it would probably
take<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.369> least<00:01:26.640> four<00:01:26.939> years<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.540> where<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
take at least four years to be where the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.130 
take at least four years to be where the
mac<00:01:28.799> pro<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.189> today<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> depends<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
mac pro is today so it depends if you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.810 
mac pro is today so it depends if you
have<00:01:31.320> plans<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> future<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
become a half use and you are not

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
become a half use and you are not
feeling<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> upgrade<00:01:36.180> your

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
feeling like you want to upgrade your

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.020 
feeling like you want to upgrade your
hardware<00:01:36.900> every<00:01:37.200> two<00:01:37.439> years<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> mac

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hardware every two years I think the mac

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090 
hardware every two years I think the mac
pro<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:39.720> investment<00:01:40.439> buying<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> two

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
pro is a very investment buying the two

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
pro is a very investment buying the two
