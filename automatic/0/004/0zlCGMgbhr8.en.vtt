00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
leasing a it simply just drops down to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
leasing a it simply just drops down to
the<00:00:32.759> water<00:00:32.940> stream<00:00:33.239> below<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> whenever<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the water stream below and whenever a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
the water stream below and whenever a
shared<00:00:35.100> pain<00:00:35.370> grows<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:36.059> gets<00:00:36.239> pushed<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.600> as

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
shared pain grows it gets pushed down as

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.040 
shared pain grows it gets pushed down as
well<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.649> same<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> pumpkin<00:00:38.899> it<00:00:39.899> gets

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
well and the same for a pumpkin it gets

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.979 
well and the same for a pumpkin it gets
pushed<00:00:40.320> down<00:00:40.520> then<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
pushed down then they all go to the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.930 
pushed down then they all go to the
bottom<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.129> stream<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:45.739> as

bottom of the stream right here as

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
bottom of the stream right here as
pumpkin<00:00:47.940> goes<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> they<00:00:49.170> should<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.559> if

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
pumpkin goes down and they should all if

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
pumpkin goes down and they should all if
you<00:00:49.950> plant<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> same<00:00:50.760> time<00:00:51.000> they

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you plant them at the same time they

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
you plant them at the same time they
should<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.050> grow<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.160> chicken<00:00:53.430> should

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
should all grow or the chicken should

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.750 
should all grow or the chicken should
lay<00:00:53.730> egg<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.629> roughly<00:00:55.260> five<00:00:55.739> minutes<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
lay egg at roughly five minutes so it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.090 
lay egg at roughly five minutes so it
should<00:00:57.030> always<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.500> perfect<00:00:58.500> amount<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.829> drops

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
should always be perfect amount of drops

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
should always be perfect amount of drops
whenever<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.520> come<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.090> should<00:01:00.239> always

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
whenever you come in there should always

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.979 
whenever you come in there should always
be<00:01:00.480> enough<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:02.190> some<00:01:02.309> time<00:01:02.460> from<00:01:02.579> five

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
be enough for a for some time from five

fancy but I'm going to be showing you
guys<00:01:11.010> how<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.490> make<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.150> let's<00:01:12.390> consider

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
guys how to make it so let's consider

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.450 
guys how to make it so let's consider
the<00:01:13.650> first<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.010> we're<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> be

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the first thing we're going to be

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.410 
the first thing we're going to be
looking<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.820> today<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.570> simple<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.850> d

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
looking at today is a simple be you d

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
looking at today is a simple be you d
switch<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> bud<00:01:19.320> switch<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.280> does<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
switch or a bud switch all it does is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
switch or a bud switch all it does is
simply<00:01:21.180> whenever<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> block<00:01:21.930> update

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
simply whenever there's a block update

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
simply whenever there's a block update
which<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.880> bud<00:01:24.119> stands<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> block

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
which is what bud stands for a block

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.520 
which is what bud stands for a block
update<00:01:25.530> tactic<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.090> i<00:01:27.180> were<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.530> update

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
update tactic so if i were to update

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
update tactic so if i were to update
this<00:01:28.680> block<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.189> by<00:01:29.790> having<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
this block right here by having the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.510 
this block right here by having the
sugarcane<00:01:30.869> grow<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.799> simply<00:01:32.159> push<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
sugarcane grow it will simply push it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.140 
sugarcane grow it will simply push it
out<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.860> do<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> again<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.729> whenever<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
out and then do it again so whenever the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969 
out and then do it again so whenever the
block<00:01:36.329> grows<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:36.990> simply<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.500> push<00:01:37.740> out

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
block grows it will simply just push out

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.880 
block grows it will simply just push out
the<00:01:38.549> sugar<00:01:38.880> cane<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.540> grown<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> leave

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the source block back so i'm going to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
the source block back so i'm going to
show<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.320> guys<00:01:43.409> how<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.040> i'm

where<00:02:09.010> you<00:02:09.160> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.400> dig<00:02:09.790> up<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.360> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
where you going to dig up like that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.710 
where you going to dig up like that
build<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.490> one<00:02:12.760> more<00:02:12.910> time<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.330> then<00:02:13.450> put<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.670 
build up one more time and then put a
repeater<00:02:14.590> right<00:02:15.130> next<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.670> where<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.910> piss<00:02:16.150> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
repeater right next to where the piss is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.910 
repeater right next to where the piss is
up<00:02:17.680> one<00:02:17.950> more<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:20.200> put<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.530> across

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
up one more and then put that across

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.210 
up one more and then put that across
like<00:02:21.370> oops<00:02:21.670> right<00:02:22.300> i<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:22.420> put<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.220> like

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
like oops right i just put that like

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.510 
like oops right i just put that like
that<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.480> then<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.590> cross<00:02:26.890> i'm<00:02:27.160> pretty<00:02:27.400> sure

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
that and then the cross i'm pretty sure

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.850 
that and then the cross i'm pretty sure
that's<00:02:27.670> how<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.240> yep<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.470> do<00:02:29.560> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that's how you do it yep so you do and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.670 
that's how you do it yep so you do and
then<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:31.480> actually<00:02:31.540> make<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.470> pops

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
then to actually make it so that it pops

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.290 
then to actually make it so that it pops
off<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:34.590> pumpkin<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.800> this<00:02:36.070> case<00:02:36.300> you're

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
can put a fence right there but pumpkins

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.339 
can put a fence right there but pumpkins
can<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.609> go<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:47.760> fences<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:48.989> have<00:03:49.260> to

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
can actually go on fences so you have to

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.679 
can actually go on fences so you have to
put<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> fence<00:03:49.769> over<00:03:50.099> here<00:03:50.310> take<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.180> away<00:03:51.390> and

put a fence over here take this away and

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.410 
put a fence over here take this away and
then<00:03:52.109> underneath<00:03:52.409> here<00:03:52.909> simply<00:03:53.909> put<00:03:54.150> down

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
then underneath here simply put down

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.460 
then underneath here simply put down
some<00:03:54.780> water<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:56.810> then<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:58.079> build<00:03:58.349> around

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
some water and then just build around

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.970 
some water and then just build around
here<00:03:59.299> you<00:04:00.299> can't<00:04:00.659> have<00:04:01.019> any<00:04:01.349> blocks<00:04:01.709> above

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
here you can't have any blocks above

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.220 
here you can't have any blocks above
that<00:04:02.639> little<00:04:02.940> area<00:04:03.090> right<00:04:03.239> there<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:04.049> have<00:04:04.139> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
that little area right there you have to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.080 
that little area right there you have to
keep<00:04:04.409> this<00:04:04.620> open<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:07.579> just<00:04:08.579> just<00:04:08.849> for

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
keep this open like that just just for

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.420 
keep this open like that just just for
the<00:04:09.180> sake<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.750> don't<00:04:10.409> really<00:04:10.650> ask<00:04:10.769> why<00:04:11.040> um

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
the sake of this don't really ask why um

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.179 
the sake of this don't really ask why um
it's<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:11.970> because<00:04:12.329> you<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.769> up<00:04:13.859> be<00:04:14.010> right

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
it's just because you get up be right

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.490 
it's just because you get up be right
there<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.939> whenever<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.540> grows<00:04:16.049> right<00:04:16.289> there

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
there so whenever it grows right there

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.020 
there so whenever it grows right there
I'll<00:04:16.739> push<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.039> up<00:04:17.280> with<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.549> little<00:04:17.820> stream

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
I'll push it up with this little stream

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.089 
I'll push it up with this little stream
that<00:04:18.180> will<00:04:18.329> have<00:04:18.449> going<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.799> stream

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
that will have going on this stream

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.980 
that will have going on this stream
local<00:04:20.400> all<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.760> way<00:04:20.880> down<00:04:21.060> here<00:04:21.979> too<00:04:22.979> and

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
local all the way down here too and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.710 
local all the way down here too and
after<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.940> I'm<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.150> build<00:04:27.360> out<00:04:27.509> like

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
after this I'm going to build out like

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.680 
after this I'm going to build out like
this<00:04:28.020> out<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:29.340> little<00:04:29.430> more<00:04:29.789> until<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> stream

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
this out a little more until a stream

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.129 
this out a little more until a stream
stops<00:04:31.470> flowing<00:04:31.860> there<00:04:32.820> we<00:04:32.940> go<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.300> then<00:04:33.960> up

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
stops flowing there we go and then up

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.520 
stops flowing there we go and then up
around<00:04:34.440> here<00:04:34.620> we're<00:04:35.610> going<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.849> build<00:04:36.090> up

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
around here we're going to build up

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.620 
around here we're going to build up
three<00:04:37.530> blocks<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:39.440> then<00:04:40.440> right<00:04:41.130> here<00:04:41.449> make<00:04:42.449> a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
three blocks and then right here make a

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.020 
three blocks and then right here make a
little<00:04:43.050> hole<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.760> will<00:04:48.120> there<00:04:48.990> we<00:04:49.229> go<00:04:49.380> and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
little hole you will there we go and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.700 
little hole you will there we go and
then<00:04:51.030> make<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.780> little<00:04:52.020> area<00:04:52.349> right<00:04:52.500> here

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
then make this little area right here

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.180 
then make this little area right here
and<00:04:53.810> build<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.199> a<00:04:55.289> little<00:04:55.440> more<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:56.010> is

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
and build up just a little more this is

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.320 
and build up just a little more this is
where<00:04:56.340> we're<00:04:56.550> going<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.789> be<00:04:56.849> taking<00:04:57.030> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
where we're going to be taking the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.439 
where we're going to be taking the
chicken<00:04:58.199> so<00:04:58.770> we<00:04:59.010> need<00:04:59.159> to<00:04:59.220> grab<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.639> sign<00:05:00.120> for

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
chicken so we need to grab a sign for

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:08.260 
chicken so we need to grab a sign for
that<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:02.479> and<00:05:03.479> a<00:05:04.159> spawn<00:05:05.159> egg<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.090> chicken

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
that and and a spawn egg of it chicken

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.110 
that and and a spawn egg of it chicken
so<00:05:09.270> just<00:05:09.720> like<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:13.310> put<00:05:14.310> down<00:05:14.430> signs<00:05:14.820> like

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
so just like that put down signs like

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.839 
so just like that put down signs like
that's<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.570> water<00:05:15.780> does<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.050> go<00:05:16.229> through<00:05:16.849> boom

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
that's the water does it go through boom

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.820 
that's the water does it go through boom
that's<00:05:18.599> fine<00:05:18.810> just<00:05:19.020> call<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.380> chickens<00:05:19.740> you

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
that's fine just call the chickens you

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.409 
that's fine just call the chickens you
really<00:05:20.039> only<00:05:20.159> need<00:05:20.250> one<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:21.120> couple

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
really only need one but a couple

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.149 
really only need one but a couple
chickens<00:05:21.720> make<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.139> more<00:05:22.260> effective<00:05:22.470> but<00:05:23.039> if

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
chickens make it more effective but if

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.270 
chickens make it more effective but if
you<00:05:23.280> want<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:23.729> that<00:05:23.909> it's<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.210> five<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.250> that

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
it's five minutes every time that one of

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.279 
it's five minutes every time that one of
these<00:05:29.760> go<00:05:29.940> up<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.270> only<00:05:30.479> want<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.840> spawn<00:05:31.050> one
