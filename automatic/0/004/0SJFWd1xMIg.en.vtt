00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.099
 hello everyone i'm aikur and we're here in 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.600
 minecraft today I 'm going to talk about the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.540
 mod that recently came out for the 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.950
 version 1.7 points and it's tuna mods and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 they did not understand me is on the screen 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.770
 by the way, it is not tuna of what the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.079
 cat or sometimes at lunch is atom 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.390
 with m the first thing that adds this 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.220
 mode is a beetle is made with four 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.910
 gold ingots and a diamond in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.520
 center and there we already have it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 this portal is good what it does 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 It is mainly adding a new 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.000
 dimension the beetle is necessary 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.730
 to go so that's why I mentioned it from 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.780
 first to go they need to do 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.210
 what I 'm doing right now 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 which is like the portal to be able to travel 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.110
 to the new dimension that adds this mode 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.240
 here 2 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.170
 and the top part that would come to 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.170
 be something like that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.700
 one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 2 perfect now remove what they place 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.150
 sand and ready 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.370
 now with the beetle they give click 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.020
 right there in the center block and 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.360
 how can they see something like this was formed 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.820
 a temple this what will allow us 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.800
 go to the new dimension work here 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.930
 and they give him right click again on the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.830
 center and there was formed a portal of 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.229
 orange or america and we are going to remove 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.900
 I have been here since I do not know why they had 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.140
 and I'm taking inventory we're going to 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.850
 go down 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 and we wait for it to take us to the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 dimension here we are already and good grandmother 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.590
 good friend grind ready this way is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.570
 in beta version so that's why he left me 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.159
 there in the hole there was already 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 finished before the first time I came 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.479
 but you are going to leave them like that below 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 of the blocks then it's up to them to finish 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.630
 with creative or survival I recommend them 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.369
 creative as it comes to be faster and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.979
 if it does not, it will take us back to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.770
 the previous dimension we put here the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.709
 exit waypoint 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.620
 just in case and we're going to let you tangle 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.599
 activated this is a teacher that is here 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.730
 in this dimension how good to see does not have 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.530
 nothing the majority of blocks that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.930
 they find that you find they are 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.060
 here they have nothing here we have one 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.810
 that is in this dimension is the bandit 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.420
 woolfolk what is called if you have 82 and 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.360
 we're going to kill him for sure now 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.360
 what I am using is strong 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.760
 it is not 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.760
 here it is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.770
 like this 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.410
 also good to find the type of weapons 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.500
 they can even make spikes or something 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.720
 a blow we are only has left 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.420
 good experience 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.730
 Here we find another small bike 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 this mode in this version is the stone 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.770
 soldier is just as strong as the previous 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.570
 here is the guard warriors who has 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.020
 on the 30th but which is one of 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.980
 the weakest and the desert world that 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.810
 good but it is with raffia 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.989
 now let's look at the other modes 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.180
 that he adds in this dimension since there's 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.480
 others that at this moment is not for 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.760
 here but let's find them one by 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.409
 one and exhaust them good to kill him here 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.510
 we have one that is the bar bar and what 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.080
 had known until this moment had 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.440
 30 of life here is the 2 of skeleton is 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.500
 like a skeleton fused with a zombie 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.730
 has 20 life 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.730
 here we had another warrior an archer 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.810
 we are going to go by that there is a chest 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.360
 let's see if he has something like they can 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.580
 see has nothing like I said before is 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.820
 most of the chests that are needed 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.220
 find here there are many by the way 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.080
 to be empty so there is one 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.900
 do not have any illusions because you can 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.230
 is empty and in what we review the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.519
 can vote 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.940
 here I have another void like 90% of the 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.940
 times 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:23.780
 Here we have another chest marcillo 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.180
 and here another one runs hidden there is that 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.889
 chest and for the first time find one 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.389
 with something you have streisand 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.389
 bone iron and 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.480
 perfect 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.890
 Finally you will find several chests 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.570
 some have good things like 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.580
 previous that he lacked food here 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.290
 we have a mummy indeed missing me 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.290
 mention he has 40 life 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.210
 well there it is 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.759
 another thing that adds this because they are what 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.770
 they are weapons tools and also 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.639
 armors that I've made like this are being 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.900
 watching here 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.259
 I have dressed in fact for the occasion 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.550
 because this armor is a stranger to the 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.960
 mod maybe not one of the most 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.800
 powerful but the same is good 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.349
 here we also have proofs 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.879
 perfect let's continue here and we're 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.340
 it would be very good for people 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.780
 who likes to do series since going to 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.819
 this dimension would be a good thing 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.669
 since they will find many minerals 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.500
 new and several things that can 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.599
 explore and have fun for example here 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.680
 It is to walk the Warriors gestures 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.680
 while jumping 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.419
 this creative and he got his friend from 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.430
 sell him but now we're going to pass the 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.840
 download process and installation 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.819
 this good way here we are already in the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.650
 download and installation process 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.030
 this way to start way in the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.120
 page that I left the description that 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.520
 is going to bring out the good page 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.469
 by the way they give you here where it says 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.840
 download up there then there's 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:01.110
 description about the mod 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.479
 in order there are also other mobs that 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.770
 I had forgotten to say in the review if 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.940
 they want to read something more about them 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.430
 there he is given to jump advertising 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.170
 they hope and they will look like this they give 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.700
 save the file I will download as I already 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.700
 I have it I 'm going to leave here 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.800
 they go to the folder where they downloaded it 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.290
 which in my case is here and before 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.950
 do something important then make a 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.720
 copy of your from your minecraft because this 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.660
 mold is in beta phase so it can 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.120
 that contains some error and if they do not want 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.150
 lose nothing nothing in minecraft is better 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.460
 make a good copy saying this and 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.080
 hoping they really do, they go now 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.930
 to the final point minecraft folder 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.880
 start execute write percentage of 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.880
 pepe data percentage and they give you to accept 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.110
 go to the minecraft point folder 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.650
 then they go to the folder that says mods 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.190
 and there they will drag the file that 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.190
 downloaded that is this one here 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.090
 and we are here 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.460
 well thats all do not forget haiti 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:17.400
 subscribe see you in the next if 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.400
 do you have any on twitter
