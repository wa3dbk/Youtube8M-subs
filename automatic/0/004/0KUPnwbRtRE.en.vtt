Modern.  What is the Modern format?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:18.340
Modern is a constructed format that allows cards from all sets from Eighth Edition and forward to be played, so long as the card is not banned.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.220
If a card was originally printed before Eighth Edition,  and then later reprinted in or after eighth Edition

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.560
then that card is legal to be played in Modern.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.520
This includes time shifted cards that were printed during the time spiral block

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.180
Unlike Extended, the format that Modern replaced

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.860
cards never rotate out

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.100
This means that unless it is later banned, cards that you can play with in Modern will always be legal.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.140
and the decks that you construct will never rotate out.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.920
Although most Modern decks have a higher initial cost than formats such as standard,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.040
the fact that they will never expire

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.460
or rotate out is often cited as why the Modern format is generally

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.420
considered more affordable in the long run.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.660
Constructed decks must contain a minimum of 60 cards

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.680
There is no maximum deck size,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.480
so long as you are able to shuffle your deck without assistance.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.520
A sideboard of fifteen cards or fewer can be used.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.520
With the exception of basic land cards, a players combined deck and sideboard cannot contain more

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.680
than 4 of any individual card

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.460
Modern derives its name from the modern card frame first introducted in Eighth Edition.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.200
Many people use this as a quick reference to determine if a card is Modern legal.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.420
However, for any card printed before Eighth Edition

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740
but then reprinted in the modern card frame

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.940
it is perfectly legal to use the older card in your deck.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.220
There are many sites that can tell you precisely

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.240
which are Modern legal and which are not

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.980
But my preferred site for this is www.Magiccards.info

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.020
Typing in any card name will give you an accurate

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.560
answer as to which formats a card is legal in.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.560
This is convenient, not only for confirming

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.600
whether a card is legal or not in Modern but also

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.380
for determining legality for other formats as well.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.120
For introductory videos about various Modern decks

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:01.220
