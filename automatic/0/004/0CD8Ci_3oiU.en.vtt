quite<00:02:20.800> my<00:02:21.550> question<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.060> for<00:02:22.239> actually<00:02:22.599> all

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
quite my question is for actually all

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.630 
quite my question is for actually all
three<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.560> actually<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.250> wanted<00:02:24.489> to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
three of you I actually just wanted to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.550 
three of you I actually just wanted to
know<00:02:24.760> obviously<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:25.900> you're<00:02:25.989> filming<00:02:26.319> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
know obviously when you're filming a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.250 
know obviously when you're filming a
movie<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.220> doesn't<00:02:27.640> necessarily<00:02:28.540> go<00:02:29.110> in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
movie it doesn't necessarily go in

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.110 
movie it doesn't necessarily go in
sequence<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.069> how<00:02:30.550> do<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.700> keep<00:02:30.819> your<00:02:30.970> stuff

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
sequence so how do you keep your stuff

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.870 
sequence so how do you keep your stuff
in<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.540> mindset<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> character<00:02:33.190> in

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
in the right mindset as the character in

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.210 
in the right mindset as the character in
order<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.330> continue<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.560> continuity<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.100> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
order to continue the continuity of the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.090 
order to continue the continuity of the
film<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.850> film<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.480> death<00:02:37.810> scene<00:02:38.170> one<00:02:38.860> day

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
film like you film a death scene one day

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.650 
film like you film a death scene one day
and<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.340> next<00:02:39.370> day<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.700> go<00:02:39.880> backwards<00:02:40.180> like

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
and the next day you go backwards like

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.650 
and the next day you go backwards like
how<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.959> keep<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:42.010> real<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:42.880> far<00:02:43.360> as<00:02:43.480> your

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
how do you keep it real as far as your

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.340 
how do you keep it real as far as your
characters<00:02:44.019> are<00:02:44.140> concerned<00:02:45.810> he's<00:02:46.810> quiet<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
characters are concerned he's quiet it

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.020 
characters are concerned he's quiet it
was<00:02:47.440> quite<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> weird<00:02:47.800> thing<00:02:47.950> when<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:48.130> kind<00:02:48.970> of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
was quite a weird thing when I kind of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.490 
was quite a weird thing when I kind of
first<00:02:49.209> started<00:02:49.480> doing<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.810> always<00:02:49.900> assumed

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
first started doing it I always assumed

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.960 
first started doing it I always assumed
that<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:51.010> doing<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.310> order<00:02:51.580> really<00:02:51.760> because

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
that just doing in order really because

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.449 
that just doing in order really because
it<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.150> turns<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.630> seems<00:02:52.810> like<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.080> most

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it just turns it seems like the most

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.520 
it just turns it seems like the most
sensible<00:02:54.459> way<00:02:54.519> yeah<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:55.330> now<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:56.440> it's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
sensible way yeah but now I think it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.170 
sensible way yeah but now I think it's
got<00:02:56.680> some<00:02:56.920> stuff<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.610> with<00:02:57.760> kind<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.090> like

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
got some stuff to do with kind of like

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.900 
got some stuff to do with kind of like
locations<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.140> availability<00:03:00.130> with<00:03:00.700> other

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
locations and availability with other

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.110 
locations and availability with other
cars<00:03:01.450> people<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.280> don't<00:03:03.280> know<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.940> quite

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
cars people and I don't know it's quite

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.979 
cars people and I don't know it's quite
weird<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.569> have<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.780> kind<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:05.160> kind<00:03:06.160> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
weird you do have to kind of kind of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.000 
weird you do have to kind of kind of
it's<00:03:07.989> quite<00:03:08.170> easy<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.410> get<00:03:08.560> lost

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
it's quite easy to get lost

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.530 
it's quite easy to get lost
and<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.310> kind<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.610> think<00:03:09.700> well<00:03:10.030> especially<00:03:10.330> in

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and you kind of think well especially in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.030 
and you kind of think well especially in
this<00:03:10.600> last<00:03:10.690> one<00:03:10.989> we've<00:03:11.080> done<00:03:11.110> because<00:03:11.440> there's

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
this last one we've done because there's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.590 
this last one we've done because there's
two<00:03:12.220> parts<00:03:12.610> there's<00:03:12.819> kind<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.060> part<00:03:13.299> 1<00:03:13.450> and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
two parts there's kind of part 1 and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.949 
two parts there's kind of part 1 and
part<00:03:13.630> 2<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:15.250> does<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.609> bit<00:03:15.700> confusing<00:03:16.180> how

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
part 2 it does get a bit confusing how

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.470 
part 2 it does get a bit confusing how

if<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.910> put<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.239> whole<00:03:34.450> team<00:03:34.660> together<00:03:34.840> they

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
if you put that whole team together they

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.900 
if you put that whole team together they
would<00:03:35.290> completely<00:03:35.799> fill<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.310> room<00:03:36.519> there's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
would completely fill this room there's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.550 
would completely fill this room there's
literally<00:03:37.239> actually<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:37.930> would<00:03:38.049> fill<00:03:38.320> a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
literally actually they would fill a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.810 
literally actually they would fill a
number<00:03:38.829> of<00:03:38.920> rooms<00:03:39.070> there<00:03:39.310> are<00:03:39.340> hundreds<00:03:39.730> of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
number of rooms there are hundreds of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.729 
number of rooms there are hundreds of
them<00:03:39.940> basically<00:03:40.329> so<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.290> start<00:03:41.560> with<00:03:41.709> a

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
them basically so we start with a

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.190 
them basically so we start with a
concept<00:03:42.190> which<00:03:42.670> is<00:03:42.820> usually<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.200> beautiful

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
concept which is usually a beautiful

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.470 
concept which is usually a beautiful
painting<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.519> evolved<00:03:45.850> over<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.209> number

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
painting that we evolved over a number

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.449 
painting that we evolved over a number
of<00:03:46.570> drafts<00:03:47.019> then<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.769> get<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.980> wonderful

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
of drafts then we get a wonderful

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.050 
of drafts then we get a wonderful
sculptor<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.470> create<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.739> creature<00:03:51.070> in<00:03:51.489> in<00:03:51.880> a

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
sculptor to create that creature in in a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.390 
sculptor to create that creature in in a
three-dimensional<00:03:53.019> form<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:54.220> there's

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
three-dimensional form and then there's

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.870 
three-dimensional form and then there's
a<00:03:54.489> team<00:03:54.700> of<00:03:54.910> animators<00:03:55.329> who<00:03:55.810> will<00:03:55.989> then<00:03:56.880> create

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
a team of animators who will then create

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.479 
a team of animators who will then create
reproduce<00:03:58.810> can<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.230> sculpture<00:03:59.650> put<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.310> into

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
reproduce can that sculpture put it into

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.550 
reproduce can that sculpture put it into
the<00:04:00.609> computer<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.569> then<00:04:01.750> animate<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.440> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
the computer and then animate it and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.069 
the computer and then animate it and
bring<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:02.920> life<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.579> each<00:04:04.329> stage<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.900> that

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
bring it to life and each stage of that

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.610 
bring it to life and each stage of that
process<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:07.030> get<00:04:07.209> involved<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.780> we<00:04:07.930> evolve<00:04:08.470> it

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
process we get involved and we evolve it

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.140 
process we get involved and we evolve it
in<00:04:08.709> develop<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:09.370> it's<00:04:09.639> quite<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.880> lot<00:04:10.120> of

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
in develop it so it's quite a lot of

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.500 
in develop it so it's quite a lot of
people<00:04:10.510> over<00:04:10.840> quite<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.049> long<00:04:11.350> period<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.799> time

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510

working<00:04:13.510> on<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:13.989> quite<00:04:14.079> complicated

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
working on it it's quite complicated

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.940 
working on it it's quite complicated
