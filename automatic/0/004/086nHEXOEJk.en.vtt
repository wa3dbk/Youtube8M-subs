start paying the actual loans itself

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
because honesty is interest that
accumulates<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.070> most<00:02:26.370> amount<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.910> money<00:02:26.970> so

extremely hard because that's really a

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.320

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
but I feel like two months or three

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.310 
but I feel like two months or three
months<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.519> good<00:03:00.030> enough<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.570> say<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.200> that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
months is good enough so say for that

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.640 
gas electricity if you're in another
state<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.390> they<00:03:27.480> pay<00:03:27.660> water<00:03:28.050> by<00:03:28.440> New

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
state I think if they pay water by New

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.140 
state I think if they pay water by New
York<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:28.980> don't<00:03:29.010> make<00:03:29.340> water<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.850> think<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.060> you

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
York we don't make water I think if you

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.690 
York we don't make water I think if you
won't<00:03:30.270> ever<00:03:30.360> get<00:03:30.600> really<00:03:30.990> fancy<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.460> get

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
won't ever get really fancy you can get

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.360 
won't ever get really fancy you can get
cable<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:33.600> that's<00:03:34.200> really<00:03:34.530> expensive<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.280> you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
cable but that's really expensive so you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.800 
cable but that's really expensive so you
could<00:03:35.580> probably<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.880> get<00:03:36.120> Internet<00:03:36.630> and

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
could probably just get Internet and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.480 
could probably just get Internet and
you'll<00:03:36.990> be<00:03:37.080> fine<00:03:37.350> how<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.800> gonna<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
you'll be fine how you gonna get to it

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.790 
you'll be fine how you gonna get to it
from<00:03:38.670> work<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.180> could<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.810> your<00:03:39.870> gas<00:03:40.110> or

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
from work that could be for your gas or

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.650 
from work that could be for your gas or
for<00:03:40.980> your<00:03:41.130> MetroCard<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.940> things<00:03:42.450> like<00:03:42.600> that

for your MetroCard and things like that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.240 
for your MetroCard and things like that
so<00:03:42.810> make<00:03:43.140> sure<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.380> accumulate<00:03:43.860> all<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.100> these

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.860 
so make sure you accumulate all of these
things<00:03:44.490> into<00:03:44.790> your<00:03:44.910> budget<00:03:45.240> but<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.690> last
