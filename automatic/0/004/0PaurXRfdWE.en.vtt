00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.730 
explanations for my car choices so let's
start<00:00:16.430> one<00:00:17.430> showed<00:00:18.000> Michigan<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.869> went<00:00:19.410> down<00:00:19.590> to

start one showed Michigan I went down to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.160 
start one showed Michigan I went down to
one<00:00:19.920> because<00:00:22.279> I<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.420> don't<00:00:24.630> need<00:00:24.810> him

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.550 

in<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> deck<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.449> good<00:00:30.720> when

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
in this deck but I think it's good when

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040 
in this deck but I think it's good when
you<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.679> him<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.420> search<00:00:33.630> him<00:00:33.870> out

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you have him and I can search him out

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
you have him and I can search him out
with<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.829> gold<00:00:35.040> sarc<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.910> right

with my gold sarc in the right the right

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
with my gold sarc in the right the right
situation<00:00:42.469> if<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.590> two<00:00:46.590> gateways<00:00:46.800> or

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
situation if I if I have two gateways or

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.529 
situation if I if I have two gateways or
at<00:00:47.640> least<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.090> gateway<00:00:48.329> already<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.129> can

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
at least one gateway already I can

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.560 
at least one gateway already I can
searching<00:00:51.539> instead<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> gateway<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.570> it's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
searching instead of gateway and it's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.150 
searching instead of gateway and it's
really<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
really good because you can really a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.060 
really good because you can really a

Shogun and I think I realize a really
good<00:01:27.150> choice<00:01:30.200> especially<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.500> i<00:01:31.860> use

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
good choice especially because i use

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.730 
good choice especially because i use
