it in sequential order you can pick and

now<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.100> second<00:01:29.549> step<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.299> optimize<00:01:30.509> all

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
now the second step is to optimize all

document that you've created now and you

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.590 
document that you've created now and you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
edit it you look through it and you make

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.040 
edit it you look through it and you make
sure<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.770> been<00:02:27.520> as<00:02:27.730> clear<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.480> concise

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.220 
sure you have been as clear and concise
as<00:02:29.410> possible<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.190> used<00:02:30.850> as<00:02:31.209> few<00:02:31.570> words<00:02:31.600> as

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
as possible and used as few words as

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.320 
as possible and used as few words as
possible<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:33.040> put<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> best

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
possible and put it in the best

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.410

sequential order possible and it makes

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.110 
sequential order possible and it makes
the<00:02:37.660> most<00:02:37.870> sense<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.950> after<00:02:39.400> you've<00:02:39.580> edited<00:02:39.760> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the most sense so after you've edited it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.229 
the most sense so after you've edited it
for<00:02:40.390> content<00:02:40.989> then<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.709> set<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.070> aside<00:02:42.160> for<00:02:42.400> a

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
for content then you set it aside for a

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.510 
for content then you set it aside for a
day<00:02:43.420> or<00:02:43.600> two<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:43.989> come<00:02:44.230> back<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.770> when<00:02:44.980> you
