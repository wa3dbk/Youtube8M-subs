00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.950
 infected and not so much to 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.660
 punish the critical mass in order 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 to solve a little damn question 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.030
 some two beasts i think we 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.840
 it is necessary to illuminate him for us on a tightrope 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.920
 through shoot 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.720
 I actually ship passed once but 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.490
 it zaglyuchil you I did not get cool 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.049
 ochumenno what I flunked Alex Mercer 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.920
 so now we own it 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.369
 reiteration 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.680
 don't need me shoot everyone you know 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.149
 just to shoot jump-jump-jump-jump I 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.039
 I will not do on me on prototype 2 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.110
 review because all have already passed it and 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.110
 played and why it is necessary to correct a 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.000
 where do we need to go 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.280
 pick up the black box new pick up though 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.140
 why do we not, I began to collect tapeworm 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:29.710
 drawers nothing a bit overshot 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:39.520

 nagaina bat or i already passed the game and and 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.110
 can not be completed 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 Even I do not understand until the end 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:59.489
 the task is generally on the map 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.430
 I'm good, let me shoot the moment 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:10.079
 let's see how it somehow turns out 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:17.510
 incomprehensible objects map map map 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:21.030
 Card from prying up in the den and a corkscrew 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:27.209
 it 's still a moronic operation name 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:31.519
 shalom line this i helped fakin gad i am so 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.519
 I understand that I went through the whole game more 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.989
 do you want fakin shield 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:50.560

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:55.290
 years in a helicopter I will die the cattle of Mary 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:04.569
 how to shoot damn rocket revenge or what 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:07.760
 rockets ss-3 helicopter dad and not on that 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.840
 I attacked the veteran of battlefield 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.140
 helicopter metal when you still pour out 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.040
 This way inside, too, can do that well, 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.040
 what do we do and 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:35.870
 open-world peri peri peri peri 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:38.400
 ricky-tikki you didnâ€™t fly you 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.610
 will you go my sacrifice 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.550
 do you have on the roof or throw you out 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.620
 what to do with him let's decide 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.639
 that is, he will see you as something 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:00.000
 you look how ugly you listen to 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:02.759
 dates but generally yes I wanted to write 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.690
 passing the game she already passed o'my 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.030
 fakin bastard but I'll post it anyway 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.180
 you know what the hell 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.900
 complete the game a second time and tell me 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.550
 do you want to 2 times or not almost 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.860
 count principle cool assembly love 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.419
 such open-world games if you like that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.539
 I would advise what the first part was 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:28.320
 sometimes very controversial so boring 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:31.560
 this part is also missing stars from the sky i 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.710
 I think that this is still used level 5 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.840
 March is so beautiful b quality level 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.930
 as performed 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.730
 but nevertheless you can wedge she 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.880
 taught 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.610
 wimp on execution is a game after all 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.840
 level yes but still i look 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.430
 already said 1 time 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.020
 because you and block because and 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.750
 immediately watch this video i will show you 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.300
 cool gun that way you can buy 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.550
 for money it certainly amazes in games 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.169
 she's an activision type that is you can 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.169
 really buy any junk for 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.310
 think for money 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.020
 antigravity field vortex this 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.330
 all the way you can turn on and 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.880
 know this paid cheat codes 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.990
 feeling cool done so look 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.840
 how it works 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.100
 Here I have this. that's me there 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.100
 shoots like their not a newspaperman 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.989
 b 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:34.530
 covered once all helicopters to the heap and 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:41.099
 now see how we can send 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:43.139
 somewhere down for example yes it is such 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.409
 less likely for a nuclear explosion in 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:50.120
 in a sense, that's very good 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.120
 cleans the streets of every stench 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.280
 the action field turns out sooo here 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.380
 It is with this gun, I passed Alex 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.250
 mercer without noticing at all because he 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.980
 could not resist 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.620
 a couple of punches very quickly 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.190
 I still kissed endlessly 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.110
 amount of charges super thing cost 400 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.830
 microsoft points of i don't know how many 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.290
 it's a dollar to save 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.690
 really, but these things are cool 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.420
 at first but then you understand very quickly 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.510
 that basically everything was enough for 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.980
 the fact that very much spoils the gameplay 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:28.450
 chick and it becomes play for not fun 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.800
 Here is such a prototype 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.630
 I wanted to show you I will not show anything 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.020
 put huskies like that pretty 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.020
 looking for a game 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:45.120
 subscribe to the channel 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:54.240

 vigorous and bye
