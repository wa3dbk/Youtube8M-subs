00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
crab fighting now she says that this is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
crab fighting now she says that this is
gonna<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.960> something<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.590> included<00:01:56.070> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
gonna be something that's included in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.999 
gonna be something that's included in
the<00:01:56.399> pirate<00:01:56.670> party<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.270> assuming<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:58.009> that

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the pirate party so I'm assuming is that

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.910 
the pirate party so I'm assuming is that
you<00:01:59.189> gotta<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> 1v1<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.960> guess<00:02:01.710> some<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you gotta get to a 1v1 I guess some of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
you gotta get to a 1v1 I guess some of
the<00:02:02.070> crabs<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.579> which<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.969> pretty<00:02:03.149> cool

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the crabs there which is pretty cool

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
the crabs there which is pretty cool
because<00:02:03.540> when<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.770> there's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
because when you think about it there's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
because when you think about it there's
never<00:02:05.070> been<00:02:05.189> anything<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
never been anything really like this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.719 
never been anything really like this
other<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> Star<00:02:07.979> Wars<00:02:08.009> party<00:02:08.489> when<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
other than the Star Wars party when you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.300 
other than the Star Wars party when you
can<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> 1v1<00:02:09.649> another<00:02:10.649> penguin<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.129> as

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
can kind of 1v1 another penguin but as

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.330 
can kind of 1v1 another penguin but as
for<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.120> guess<00:02:12.510> others

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
for I guess others

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.059 
for I guess others
use<00:02:13.550> go<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.780> couldn't<00:02:15.050> really<00:02:15.140> do<00:02:15.800> anything

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
use go you couldn't really do anything

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.030 
use go you couldn't really do anything
as<00:02:16.940> far<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.569> one<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.379> guess<00:02:18.739> when<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
as far as that one so I guess when the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.530 
as far as that one so I guess when the
crabs<00:02:19.250> arrived<00:02:19.550> here<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:19.849> rock<00:02:19.970> copper<00:02:20.300> ship
