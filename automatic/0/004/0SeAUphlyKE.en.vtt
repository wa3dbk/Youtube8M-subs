00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.010 
experience three years there for you and
I've<00:00:21.210> been<00:00:21.360> trying<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.900> even

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I've been trying to think about even

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.810 
I've been trying to think about even
what<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> ask<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.920> where<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> go<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
what to ask you or where to go with this

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.269 
what to ask you or where to go with this
but<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.270> I<00:00:24.450> mean<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.439> would<00:00:25.590> seem<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:26.070> sure

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
but if I mean it would seem I'm sure

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.859 
but if I mean it would seem I'm sure
that<00:00:26.550> you've<00:00:26.670> had<00:00:26.880> probably<00:00:27.450> immediately<00:00:27.810> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
that you've had probably immediately you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.240 
that you've had probably immediately you
had<00:00:27.990> second<00:00:28.349> thoughts<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.650> taking<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
had second thoughts about taking that

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.750 
had second thoughts about taking that
job<00:00:29.520> but<00:00:29.930> if<00:00:30.930> you<00:00:31.050> could<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.320> thing<00:00:31.760> over

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
job but if you could do one thing over

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.210 
job but if you could do one thing over
again<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.570> those<00:00:34.379> three<00:00:34.680> years<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.129> would

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
again in those three years what would

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.630 
again in those three years what would
you<00:00:35.340> pay<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.850> wouldn't<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.140> much<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
listen to outside the noise that's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
always a vice you hear well had I been

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
always a vice you hear well had I been
more<00:00:51.510> open<00:00:51.890> maybe<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.370> seen<00:00:53.579> some

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
more open maybe I would have seen some

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
more open maybe I would have seen some
things<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> were<00:00:54.450> happening<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.200> we're

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
things that were happening that we're

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.440 
things that were happening that we're
kind<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.590> undermining<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.280> program<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.120> what

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
kind of undermining the program and what

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:07.750 
kind of undermining the program and what
we're<00:00:57.600> trying<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.260> day<00:00:58.289> one

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.190 

you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.150> take<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.690> assumption

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you know you just take the assumption

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
you know you just take the assumption
that<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.860> matter<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.370> go<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that no matter where you go that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
that no matter where you go that
everybody<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:13.020> organization<00:01:13.830> or

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
everybody that's in your organization or

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
everybody that's in your organization or
at<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.850> school<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:16.140> rooting<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.950> and

aren't rooting for you or aren't helping

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.780 
aren't rooting for you or aren't helping
you<00:01:24.660> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.290> build<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> program<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.310> they

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
you you know build the program and they

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.010 
you you know build the program and they
got<00:01:26.970> pulling<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> rope<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.750> different

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
got pulling the rope in different

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
got pulling the rope in different
directions<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:29.040> makes<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.490> difficult

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
directions it makes it more difficult

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
directions it makes it more difficult
and<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.630> mistakes<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> made<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and there was mistakes that we made to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
and there was mistakes that we made to
certainly<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.630> found<00:01:34.050> out<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> whole<00:01:34.350> lot

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
certainly it but I found out a whole lot

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.740 
certainly it but I found out a whole lot
more<00:01:34.740> things<00:01:35.009> after<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.399> left<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.940> this<00:01:36.450> thing
