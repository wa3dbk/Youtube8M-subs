go down low fat this for some reason is
all<00:02:02.830> worn<00:02:03.790> out<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.540> could<00:02:04.690> tell<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.200> was

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
all worn out you could tell it was

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.139 
all worn out you could tell it was
rubbing<00:02:06.580> heavily<00:02:08.700> someone<00:02:09.700> cut<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.090> open

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
rubbing heavily someone cut that open

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.470 
rubbing heavily someone cut that open
well<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.140> Hawai<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.860> for<00:02:12.670> some<00:02:12.850> reason<00:02:12.880> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
well in Hawai and for some reason is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.500 
well in Hawai and for some reason is
wiring<00:02:14.080> under<00:02:14.320> here<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:15.360> screwed<00:02:16.360> I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
wiring under here that is screwed I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.100 
wiring under here that is screwed I
think<00:02:16.780> oh<00:02:17.880> no<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.090> don't<00:02:19.300> think<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.990> it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
think oh no I don't think you can see it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.830 
think oh no I don't think you can see it
from<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:22.420> all<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.100> old<00:02:24.840> static

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
from here it's all for this old static

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.810 
from here it's all for this old static
stuff<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:27.360> then<00:02:28.360> stuff<00:02:29.110> under<00:02:29.380> here

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
stuff like that then stuff under here

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.920 
stuff like that then stuff under here
wires<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:31.030> have<00:02:31.150> been<00:02:31.240> disconnected<00:02:31.660> I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
wires that have been disconnected I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.740 
wires that have been disconnected I
can't<00:02:32.200> figure<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.590> out<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.090> got<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.300> manual

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
can't figure it out but I got a manual

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.449 
can't figure it out but I got a manual
so<00:02:34.930> I'll<00:02:35.050> be<00:02:35.170> able<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.410> figure<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.709> all<00:02:36.010> wires

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
so I'll be able to figure that all wires

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.600 
so I'll be able to figure that all wires
had<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.090> done<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:38.100> got<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.220> all<00:02:39.340> torn

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
had then just done up got it all torn

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.050 
had then just done up got it all torn
apart<00:02:39.700> because<00:02:40.120> I'm<00:02:40.540> trying<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.400> assume<00:02:42.400> fix

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
apart because I'm trying to assume fix

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.510 
apart because I'm trying to assume fix
problems<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:44.260> was<00:02:44.440> originally<00:02:44.980> green<00:02:45.280> if<00:02:45.490> you
