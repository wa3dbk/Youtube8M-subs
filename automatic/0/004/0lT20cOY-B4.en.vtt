00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
if you're more of a collector or really

a<00:02:35.320> big<00:02:35.560> fan<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.980> Euro<00:02:36.160> 2012<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.940> is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
a big fan of the Euro 2012 this is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.000 
a big fan of the Euro 2012 this is
probably<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.810> as<00:02:38.410> opposed<00:02:38.890> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
probably the one to have as opposed to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.440 
probably the one to have as opposed to
the<00:02:39.160> standard<00:02:39.400> ball<00:02:39.760> simply<00:02:40.000> because<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.420> has

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the standard ball simply because it has

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.180 
the standard ball simply because it has
all<00:02:40.810> these<00:02:40.990> little<00:02:41.140> extra<00:02:41.620> things<00:02:41.830> on<00:02:42.010> here

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
all these little extra things on here

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.540 
all these little extra things on here
that<00:02:43.200> definitely<00:02:44.200> don't<00:02:44.800> change<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> actual

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
that definitely don't change the actual

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.190 
that definitely don't change the actual
performance<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> ball<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:46.930> cool<00:02:47.050> to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
performance of the ball but it's cool to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.600 
performance of the ball but it's cool to
have<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.740> something<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.340> little<00:02:48.520> bit

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
