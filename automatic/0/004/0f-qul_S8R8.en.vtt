00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
 koschei finder meter 25k 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.670
 with deep reel 60 centimeters 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.490
 we carry out the test started by air then in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.190
 primer is even held in wife action 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.539
 interference as you see point to the device 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.180
 we stabilize the device we all have a threshold 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 we will drag at first badly 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.010
 metal bar plate 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.780
 it turns out the size is about 20 centimeters 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:39.989
 three and a half centimeters to four 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 collect by putting spend give eat 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.020
 small false alarms 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 try on maximum sensitivity 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 This is with us, Peter, half a meter 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.219
 it's a meter it's a meter and a half starting 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.219
 to bring a meter and a half meter 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.140
 some operation per meter 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.080
 clear signal 80 centimeters 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.920
 clear signal 80 centimeters now 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.080
 let's do a little less depth we raise 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.890
 threshold to eight 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 stabilize the device again the same 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.570
 the plate is half a meter 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.570
 begin to divert 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.680
 the same 75 80 centimeters bar size 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.350
 it turns out 4 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.350
 20 centimeters again 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.510
 bar debug further we will carry out the test 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.930
 on a metal plate which is already 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.490
 she feels from here the dimensions of plate 20 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:36.370
 centimeters somewhere in the 30 start with 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:36.370
 a meter and a half there is a signal and a meter and a half 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.530
 half a meter 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.740
 80 centimeters meter 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.840
 meter forty meter forty signal is interrupted 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.670
 one and a half meter the final signal is very 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:17.690
 weak we remove one and a half meters again 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.960
 false positives set off 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.000
 meter forty 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:38.560
 once again just drop forty by meter 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:44.710
 on top of vasinu clear signal try 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.710
 farther again usual spade 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:55.470
 let down 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:59.240
 from meter clear signal we remove meter 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.240
 thirty practically silent 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.430
 meter-twenty 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.430
 we remove 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.340
 feels like a shovel 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.340
 we drag off 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.650
 fell silent 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.050
 here you and koschey 25k
