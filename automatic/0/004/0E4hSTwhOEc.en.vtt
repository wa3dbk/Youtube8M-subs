 We will do it with a bottle of Coca-Cola

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.279

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.650
 of foami rosa diamantado of 36.5 by 9 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.189
 centimeters and a strip of pink foami 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.439
 increased by 38 centimeters 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.980
 centimeter in a piece of simple foami 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.190
 in purple of 36.5 by 6.5 feelings 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.770
 we also need mental food in 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.980
 purple and silver color to make 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.610
 confetti like this 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.990
 a rule 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.150
 scissors a puncher an exact or 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.260
 copper 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.340
 a feeley pencil with a bottle of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.050
 plastic 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.350
 I'm going to use a bottle of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.350
 Coca Cola 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.620
 and a sticker or decal of purpose 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.620
 Social 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.940
 first we cut the bottle in this 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.940
 line 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 do not 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.450
 we match by cutting some two 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.450
 centimeters 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 if you use any other bottle measures 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 that you stay of 13 centimeters of height 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.740
 and measure around the bottle so that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.740
 you know how long the background should be 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.690
 in the home and purple we mark with a 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.230
 point asking one centimeter to one of 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.230
 the sides 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.270
 we mark an eagle 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.940
 on the line we drill 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.840
 leaving about one centimeter between 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.840
 each of them 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.150
 so we continue to finish the line 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.000
 now we put the strip shape and pink 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.000
 between the holes 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.400
 this is how the immoral foam will look 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.940
 we stick it on the bottle in this 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.940
 part 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.910
 this is going to be stuck 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.020
 we put silicon in these spaces and 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.020
 we stick the fome there 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.450
 we have the bottom part of the candy 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.670
 now let's do the crown we flipped 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.940
 the foam and rose with diamond 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.209
 we do not double check to know where it is 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.209
 half and if we speak with a line 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.610
 from the line we make medium 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.610
 circle 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.469
 now we try to form half of a 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.469
 heart 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.460
 and we leave here and start another 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.460
 half 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.870
 as if we made three mountaineers 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.950
 here we ended with a line to the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.180
 shore we measure 3 centimeters in height and 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.180
 there we finish the line 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.170
 it's going to stay that way I'm going to mark it a little 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.170
 more so that they can see it 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.040
 is already here marked 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:11.130
 let's cut over the line 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.130
 since we cut we doubled in half 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.530
 and we cut the other side 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:22.449
 I already have the cropped crown here 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.610
 now we stick the confetti in silver 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.610
 especially the outline of the crown 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.820
 we have here the confetti stuck on 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:07.020
 all the outline put three circles 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.270
 purple in these parts 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.430
 Now let's place one more circle 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.430
 large at the tip of the crown 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.910
 and here we paste the decal 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:33.760
 instead of decal also you can 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.760
 use paper cutouts to give away 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.769
 the crown is finished 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.050
 nothing else has to be beaten 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.979
 and the sweet is finished or if you 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:04.130
 liked give me a like and do not forget 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:06.759
