yeah okay so there's now a six digit
number<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.299> screen<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.110> can't<00:01:43.409> see

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
number on that screen then I can't see

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.840 
number on that screen then I can't see
but<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.189> gonna<00:01:44.280> try<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.579> make<00:01:44.700> some

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
but I'm gonna try and make some

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.380 
but I'm gonna try and make some
predictions<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.840> number<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:47.899> suspect

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
predictions about that number I suspect

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.999 
predictions about that number I suspect
it's<00:01:51.390> probably<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.100> even<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.789> I

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
it's probably it was even or not I

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
it's probably it was even or not I
reckon<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.189> reckon<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.789> probably<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> multiple

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
reckon I reckon it's probably a multiple

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.490 
reckon I reckon it's probably a multiple
of<00:01:57.960> 13<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.860> reckon<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> hit<00:02:00.090> divide<00:02:00.539> by<00:02:00.810> 13

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
of 13 I reckon if you hit divide by 13

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
of 13 I reckon if you hit divide by 13
you<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.250> whole<00:02:02.579> number<00:02:02.789> answer<00:02:03.240> have

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you will get a whole number answer have

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.529 
you will get a whole number answer have
a<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.569> see<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.079> right<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.799> multiple<00:02:05.189> 13

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.270 

it<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.690> okay<00:02:10.289> excellent<00:02:10.530> okay<00:02:10.799> I<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.160> more

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it is okay excellent okay I can do more

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.600 
it is okay excellent okay I can do more
than<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.480> probably<00:02:13.580> also<00:02:14.580> a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
than that I think it's probably also a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.589 
than that I think it's probably also a
multiple<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> one<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.390> prime<00:02:15.569> factors

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
multiple of one of the prime factors

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.500 
multiple of one of the prime factors
could<00:02:16.049> have<00:02:16.700> seven<00:02:17.700> try<00:02:17.910> seven<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
could have seven try seven is it a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.580 
could have seven try seven is it a
multiple<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.989> seven<00:02:19.290> socially<00:02:20.190> divided<00:02:20.580> seven

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
multiple of seven socially divided seven

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.750 
multiple of seven socially divided seven
number<00:02:22.590> Leah<00:02:23.280> yes

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
number Leah yes

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.559 
number Leah yes
yeah<00:02:24.239> pit<00:02:24.450> divine<00:02:24.860> seven<00:02:25.860> equals<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
yeah pit divine seven equals is it a

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.610 
yeah pit divine seven equals is it a
whole<00:02:27.720> number<00:02:27.810> yeah

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
whole number yeah

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.490 
whole number yeah
all<00:02:28.769> right<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.459> more<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:30.239> reckon<00:02:31.230> it's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
all right can you one more I reckon it's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.770 
all right can you one more I reckon it's
also<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.890> multiple<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.430> 11<00:02:32.900> try<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.110> try<00:02:34.440> /<00:02:34.709> 11

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.880 

this<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.959> whole<00:02:40.109> number<00:02:40.200> X<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> what's

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
this is the whole number X and what's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.990 
this is the whole number X and what's
through<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.430> final<00:02:41.819> whole<00:02:41.940> number<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
through the final whole number is the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.670 
through the final whole number is the
same<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.480> start<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.049> are<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.350> that's<00:02:46.530> my

same we start there you are so that's my

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.759 
same we start there you are so that's my
incredible<00:02:47.280> mental<00:02:48.269> maths<00:02:48.660> magic<00:02:49.290> ability

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
incredible mental maths magic ability

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.140 
incredible mental maths magic ability
thank<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.370> very<00:02:50.489> much<00:02:55.819> okay<00:02:56.819> now<00:02:57.000> I'm<00:02:57.060> going

thank you very much okay now I'm going

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.789 
thank you very much okay now I'm going
to<00:02:57.269> explain<00:02:57.569> how<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.870> number<00:02:58.170> trick<00:02:58.560> works

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
to explain how that number trick works

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.620 
to explain how that number trick works
and<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.370> should<00:02:59.670> mention<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.150> very<00:03:00.239> beginning

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
and I should mention the very beginning

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.509 
and I should mention the very beginning
you<00:03:00.750> don't<00:03:00.959> need<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.290> use<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> cards<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.220> only

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
you don't need to use the cards the only

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.849 
you don't need to use the cards the only
reason<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.090> did<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.630> with<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.109> deck<00:03:04.319> of<00:03:04.440> cards

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
reason I did this with the deck of cards

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.650 
reason I did this with the deck of cards
to<00:03:05.010> pick<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> three-digit<00:03:05.760> number<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.359> if

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
to pick the three-digit number is if

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.840 
to pick the three-digit number is if
people<00:03:06.810> watch<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.470> magic<00:03:07.859> trick<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.519> video

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
people watch a magic trick in a video

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.420 
people watch a magic trick in a video
they<00:03:09.540> assume<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.350> volunteer<00:03:10.889> weekly

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
they assume that the volunteer weekly

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.160 
they assume that the volunteer weekly
just<00:03:11.639> well<00:03:11.819> we<00:03:11.940> could<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.120> organized<00:03:12.630> what

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
just well we could have organized what

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.080 
just well we could have organized what
number<00:03:13.560> he<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.069> pick<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.609> cards

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
number he was going to pick so the cards

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.150 
number he was going to pick so the cards
show<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.810> was<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.019> random<00:03:16.530> number<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.040> if

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
show that it was a random number and if

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.039 
show that it was a random number and if
you<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.489> with<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> live<00:03:17.910> volunteer<00:03:18.480> then

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
you do this with a live volunteer then

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.690 
you do this with a live volunteer then
just<00:03:19.530> ask<00:03:19.709> them<00:03:19.950> pick<00:03:20.280> any<00:03:20.459> random

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
just ask them pick any random

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580 
just ask them pick any random
three-digit<00:03:21.389> number<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:21.840> our<00:03:22.079> purposes

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
three-digit number but for our purposes

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.470 
three-digit number but for our purposes
I'll<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.370> another<00:03:23.489> one<00:03:23.609> with<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.910> cards<00:03:24.269> very

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I'll do another one with the cards very

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.289 
I'll do another one with the cards very
quickly<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:24.989> let's<00:03:25.139> say<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.500> one<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:26.519> six

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
quickly so let's say we do one for six

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.229 
quickly so let's say we do one for six
now<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> random<00:03:29.130> number<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.549> your

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
now this is a random number and your

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.789 
now this is a random number and your
volunteer<00:03:30.750> will<00:03:30.900> give<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.200> some<00:03:31.440> random

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
volunteer will give you some random

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.349 
volunteer will give you some random
number<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.340> had<00:03:32.489> no<00:03:32.700> idea<00:03:32.880> if<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.180> was

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
number and I had no idea if this was

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.870 
number and I had no idea if this was
going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.540> be<00:03:33.660> an<00:03:33.750> even<00:03:34.079> number<00:03:34.370> what<00:03:35.370> factors

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
going to be an even number what factors

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.009 
going to be an even number what factors
it<00:03:36.000> would<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.450> could<00:03:36.569> be<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> prime<00:03:36.989> number

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
it would have it could be a prime number

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.339 
it would have it could be a prime number
and<00:03:37.620> I'd<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.829> very<00:03:38.220> excited<00:03:38.700> if<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.880> was<00:03:39.349> but

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
and I'd be very excited if it was but

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.340 
and I'd be very excited if it was but
what<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.949> get<00:03:41.340> them<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.669> do<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.660> enter<00:03:43.229> it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
what I get them to do is to enter it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.630 
what I get them to do is to enter it
into<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.680> calculator<00:03:43.910> twice

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
into the calculator twice

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.940 
into the calculator twice
and<00:03:45.760> that's<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.420> sneaky<00:03:46.840> bit<00:03:47.020> because<00:03:47.530> one

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
and that's the sneaky bit because one

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.760 
and that's the sneaky bit because one
four<00:03:48.220> six<00:03:48.490> one<00:03:48.850> four<00:03:50.610> six<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:52.060> now<00:03:52.660> do<00:03:52.720> know<00:03:53.320> some

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
four six one four six I now do know some

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.100 
four six one four six I now do know some
things<00:03:54.010> about<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.340> because<00:03:54.730> entering<00:03:55.330> an<00:03:55.570> a3

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
things about that because entering an a3

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.740 
things about that because entering an a3
number<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.710> twice<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.910> same<00:03:58.450> as

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
number in twice is the same as

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.290 
number in twice is the same as
multiplying<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.770> by<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.980> thousand<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:00.850> one

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
multiplying it by a thousand and one

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.030 
multiplying it by a thousand and one
so<00:04:01.630> actually<00:04:02.020> what<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:02.140> can<00:04:02.290> do<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.470> clear<00:04:02.740> this

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
so actually what I can do is clear this

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.740 
so actually what I can do is clear this
and<00:04:03.820> if<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.150> put<00:04:04.420> in<00:04:04.630> my<00:04:04.990> one<00:04:05.650> four<00:04:05.920> six<00:04:06.160> again<00:04:06.750> 1

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
and if I put in my one four six again 1

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.510 
and if I put in my one four six again 1
4<00:04:07.960> 6<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.440> hit<00:04:08.590> multiply<00:04:10.320> 1001<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.620> hit<00:04:12.040> equals

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
4 6 and hit multiply 1001 and hit equals

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.690 
4 6 and hit multiply 1001 and hit equals
I<00:04:12.760> get<00:04:13.210> one<00:04:13.390> four<00:04:13.600> six<00:04:13.870> one<00:04:14.110> four<00:04:14.350> six<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.340> now

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
I get one four six one four six so I now

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.970 
I get one four six one four six so I now
know<00:04:16.080> whatever<00:04:17.080> their<00:04:17.290> three-digit<00:04:17.739> number

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
know whatever their three-digit number

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.540 
know whatever their three-digit number
was<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.910> now<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.269> multiple<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.400> 1001<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.700> 1002

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
was it's now a multiple of 1001 and 1002

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.760 
was it's now a multiple of 1001 and 1002
seven<00:04:24.550> eleven<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.210> thirteen<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:26.230> I<00:04:26.260> now<00:04:26.530> know

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
seven eleven and thirteen so I now know

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.500 
seven eleven and thirteen so I now know
that<00:04:26.920> whatever<00:04:27.070> this<00:04:27.310> number<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:28.390> will

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
that whatever this number is it will

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.300 
that whatever this number is it will
have<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.810> factors<00:04:29.230> seven<00:04:29.650> eleven<00:04:30.070> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
have the factors seven eleven and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.460 
have the factors seven eleven and
thirteen<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.910> fact<00:04:31.120> if<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.360> divide<00:04:31.720> by<00:04:32.020> all<00:04:32.230> of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
thirteen in fact if you divide by all of

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.170 
thirteen in fact if you divide by all of
them<00:04:32.650> it's<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.250> same<00:04:33.430> as<00:04:33.610> dividing<00:04:33.730> by<00:04:34.060> a

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
them it's the same as dividing by a

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.940 
them it's the same as dividing by a
thousand<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.810> one<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.200> you'll<00:04:35.560> get<00:04:35.740> back<00:04:35.920> to

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
thousand and one and you'll get back to

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.040 
thousand and one and you'll get back to
the<00:04:36.160> original<00:04:36.250> three-digit<00:04:37.240> number<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.930> there

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
the original three-digit number so there

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.560 
the original three-digit number so there
you<00:04:38.110> are<00:04:38.140> it's<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.190> self<00:04:39.430> working<00:04:39.820> trick<00:04:40.090> all
