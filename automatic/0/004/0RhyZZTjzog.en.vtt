00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
well as i believe just the wireless

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.760 
well as i believe just the wireless
signal<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.909> well<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.720> Wi-Fi<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.619> also

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
signal as well for Wi-Fi and then also

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
signal as well for Wi-Fi and then also
just<00:01:43.950> whatever<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> network's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
just whatever the you know the network's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.760 
just whatever the you know the network's
pick<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.009> seems<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.640> although<00:01:48.770> they

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
pick up so it seems like although they

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.760 
pick up so it seems like although they
you<00:01:50.430> know<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:50.579> went<00:01:51.210> away<00:01:51.299> from<00:01:51.450> there

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
you know they went away from there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.920 
you know they went away from there
seamless<00:01:52.770> design<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:54.060> functionality<00:01:54.840> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the a4 chip that they have inside of it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.990 
the a4 chip that they have inside of it
as<00:02:00.899> well<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> micro<00:02:01.710> sim<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
something that they call FaceTime so you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.279
