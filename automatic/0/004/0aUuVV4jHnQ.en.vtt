00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi all guys are angels of sar 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 the former play fifa www.lexbook.it facebook 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.660
 indiscretion and I'm here today with the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 before him daily and the second 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.070
 that will really be that of lammari 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.170
 morigia and let's talk about carlo on iv the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.510
 real sociedad player who you are 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.949
 earned this card four goals per 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.109
 Celt vigo that earned the victory 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.640
 for 4 to 3 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.099
 in fact we can give more attention than 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.199
 this card iv more a umbro row 22 in the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.820
 dribbling plus is not headshot the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.619
 his painter nor the header is more 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 not in defense 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.120
 this card looks very good with 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.040
 precisely of the beautiful salici e 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 above all going to analyze in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 in green set 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.579
 specifically we can see 90 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 met dancing 93 in finalization 92 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 whole on flight 90 in acceleration 92 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.180
 agility 87 instead looks and also 83 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 in the positioning merged however as always 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's analyze pros and cons of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.969
 this player 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.039
 let's start with the pros because he is one 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.180
 legend and so we start said while 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.830
 in the legends an export and the cons but 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.810
 apart from this crap here and you though 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.530
 remarkable are definitely first thing 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.320
 dribbling this player to 90's 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 ball control then to 90's 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 acceleration that serves in dribbling but 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 especially in 92 the 4-star agility 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 skill and 91 of pure dribbling and therefore of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.150
 returning with him is a pleasure then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 especially in agility is pinning 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.860
 of the fact that even fast you would say 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.369
 really well manages to escape a thousand 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.630
 ways and opponents we mentioned 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.030
 at speed above all 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.780
 acceleration and then we say that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.369
 despite having only on paper 87 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.770
 then going into the game at 90 in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.009
 acceleration 87 instead the click e 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 so this seems to be a reality 88 89 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.119
 if they seem a little more in game only 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.729
 thanks to the acceleration is the fact that 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.829
 he is very agile then speed and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.469
 dribbling are two beautiful thumbs up 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.320
 however the most important element though 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.030
 the attacker 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.340
 obviously the pull plus 6 from the version 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.800
 above all we can not see fit 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.610
 a plus 11 in finalization we can 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.270
 see a plus 10 in long shots and all 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.970
 this is seen because this player 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.920
 when it pulls left and devastating 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 that is, one can dribble all then 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.420
 easily enter the area and you can 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.130
 break through the left door though 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.470
 the power to say is not so high but 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.350
 it is not one of his cons that it is anyway 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.269
 an average value is however we said from 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.570
 even at a decided power he never fails 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.190
 no other finalization is something 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.850
 of exceptional 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 but I said yes and then now 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.530
 I speak for a moment of his counter why 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.040
 the most remarkable account of this 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.860
 player 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.560
 the two stars see you practically 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.989
 you have a toe to a foot 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.959
 that is, right wing is practically 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.760
 non-existent and so this made me 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.810
 as a beginning would say a little twist the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.030
 nose because it is not 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.770
 it's not nice not being able to pull with a pm 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.470
 I don't know how to explain and also in 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.350
 passages that are another though that 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.410
 now I'll tell you note that two stars 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.810
 then ugly bubbles down from the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.340
 illustrious bill is weak and seen that there 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.560
 we end up on the fly for 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.950
 speak of accounts by saying of strength 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.660
 physics 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.709
 the 73 is not so bad but you throw it down 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.320
 that is, relative encounter is not so against 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.780
 never quite a point I do n't know how 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.970
 explaining it is not undecided if you put it 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.070
 they didn't put it at the end 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.530
 a bit fussy and because it isn't anyway 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.230
 strong physically apple has anything else 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.660
 we say well in the passages when always 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.910
 when having the accident 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.080
 this guy municipal passages will be 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:03.580
 because he was born of wing but in 82 the passages 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.519
 then the pilot votes and excuse the 75 in 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.810
 cross that looks more are two beautiful and 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.819
 that is above all face messages 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.040
 precisely this found very well in the 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.769
 books almost never so it is very useful 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.350
 for lines 2 and then a nice thumb 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.260
 up also the last tastings though 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.150
 surprise indeed the penultimate blow it 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.030
 head made me three headed goals 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.220
 which for which the value of 67 mediocre 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.039
 on paper it is very surprised 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.530
 and then he also low that is the other 177 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:37.120
 177 but he manages to jump to catch her 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.479
 always done see another one here 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.669
 context and therefore can and will be one 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.660
 pleasant surprise and so it is me 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.990
 so really liked the last one 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.560
 the last though if I network the low jump 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.979
 he is always in position and that makes you 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.080
 allows both on counter-attacks to do 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.160
 so many beautiful things that is he is always 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:07.450
 and we know that maybe on the cross and always 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.240
 goodness to receive them and then boh its price 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.449
 they are excellent in conclusion then 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.400
 and now that he is reviewing the last clip 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:22.099
 that you had to jump some nice defender 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.530
 opponent and then the pass is this one 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.300
 we are the top finish top finisher 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.669
 just then head throw dribbling passes 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.000
 right flop speed weak foot strength 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.979
 physics 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.270
 Having said this, I greet you and leave you 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.270
