00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.289
 saha him to all is the goleador then 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.720
 I hope everything goes well for you 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.149
 then me on my side quietly 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.180
 I finally got my pc back 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.980
 now it goes a little more turn 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.629
 more regularly then we end up 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.220
 today for a new 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.750
 presentation a little focus on a 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.470
 Recently transferred player from manchester 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.050
 city to Milan to the ace and to clarify 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.339
 so he was snapped up after his four 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.040
 first matches where he scored four 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:01:00.890
 at five goals we will be able to compare 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.799
 his statistics so the 84th claude him 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.479
 at 85 then we can notice that these 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.880
 attributes as a scorer and 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.520
 finisher have clearly increased well 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.200
 minimum 5 to 6 percentage points across 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.630
 we can see that in the break 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.790
 bhl in the finish 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.280
 in long distance shooting in the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.439
 penaltys in his power and in his 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.810
 volleyed by the hour it's a 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.909
 attacker than me I will rather use 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.270
 as pivot or drunk with someone 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.850
 still a little faster on the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.890
 duet side then in his abilities 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.120
 physical we can notice who wins 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.520
 in agility 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.550
 his acceleration a little bit caught 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.790
 reaction it has a +10 without reaction and a 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.420
 + 9 in endurance so much more 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.750
 enduring the balotelli that makes it just 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.800
 an ice cabinet 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.290
 that's why I'm telling you 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.960
 as a pivot it is great we 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.640
 opposing defenders really had to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.680
 wrong to take him the ball then 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.759
 mental qualities we see that he took 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.459
 a +10 in aggression so a little more 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.810
 speed up the balotelli then you go 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.120
 to be able to see in the game the first 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.709
 phases are as pivot then 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.350
 you will be able to see these 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.560
 statistics as a shooter for 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.530
 after finishing on his attributes of 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.660
 finisher and scorer then I'll you in 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.670
 thank you all for this viewing 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.670
 and you guys see you soon 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.820
 it's a pass success 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 m 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.319
 is it 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.520
 a little 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.560
 all are out 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.860
 the 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.860
 no
