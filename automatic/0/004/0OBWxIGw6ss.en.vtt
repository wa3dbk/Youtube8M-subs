00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:55.400
 It is written here and it is here 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.120

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.190
 I guess after 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.350
 Toma this diffuser 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.350
 I understand that it is a diffuser that is this 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.629
 Battery box here 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.850
 Well this motor is also this motor look 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.750
 I'd seen it get to hang out with think 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.760
 It is a face to Hyper Dash 2 motor 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.290
 What is Hyper Dash 2 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.150
 This very fast 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.150
 It is inter fast 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 Yes yes 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.340
 For example Well 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.720
 And to put white the Maba body in as scheduled for that future 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.540
 Considerably reinforce 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.840
 But I want to put be a damper 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.680
 Say you want to overwhelm 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.680
 It is a place 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.250
 Ah 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.440
 It is a wheel 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 I would like to use this 5-spoke management engineer's orange wheel as a trend wheel 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.150
 is not it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.940

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.970
 Hmm still 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:28.920
 I think I 'm going to evolve a lot , because I'm pretty great aerodynamics too 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.120
 There is a duct here, but from here it sucks the air for motor cooling and cools it 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.500
 Throat 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.760
 9 more 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.230
 It looks like a face 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.930
 Because it hurts 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.530
 Take in air to cool the battery 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.130
 There are a lot of parties to hold 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.760
 I think I'm really worried about this 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.080
 This is that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.000

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.220

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.320
 It feels like 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.280
 Well, I'm going to introduce it when it is finished 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.370
