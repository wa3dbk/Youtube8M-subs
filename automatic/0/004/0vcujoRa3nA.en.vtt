answer and you know being exposed to

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.949 
answer and you know being exposed to
Darren<00:03:18.260> slack<00:03:18.700> finally<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:20.060> had<00:03:20.570> someone<00:03:20.930> that

deputy<00:03:55.609> drop<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:55.970> one<00:03:56.660> two<00:03:56.870> three<00:03:57.200> start<00:03:57.530> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
deputy drop it's one two three start the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.370 
deputy drop it's one two three start the
throg<00:03:58.010> okay<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.060> all<00:03:59.389> about<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.750> third<00:04:00.049> step

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
throg okay so all about the third step

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
biomechanics and how the throw works you

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.840 
biomechanics and how the throw works you
know<00:04:10.050> what<00:04:10.320> has<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.530> be<00:04:10.710> where<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.400> has<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.700> be

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
know what has to be where it has to be

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.050 
know what has to be where it has to be

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
and when it has to be there we flat out

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.570 
and when it has to be there we flat out
and<00:04:15.510> get<00:04:15.690> kids<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.140> better<00:04:16.410> get<00:04:17.130> quarterback
