00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
anything I've ever tried these

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.719 
anything I've ever tried these
headphones<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.040> much<00:01:59.219> better<00:01:59.460> than

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
headphones are just so much better than

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
headphones are just so much better than
the<00:01:59.880> Beats<00:02:00.060> Tour<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:01.259> exactly<00:02:01.560> why

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the Beats Tour and that's exactly why

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
the Beats Tour and that's exactly why
it's<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.939> easy<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> compare<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it's so easy to compare them to the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's so easy to compare them to the
solos<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.159> obviously<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.790> base<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
solos now obviously the base and the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.029 
solos now obviously the base and the
solos<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.530> deeper<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
solos is going to be a bit deeper and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.249 
solos is going to be a bit deeper and
heavier<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.700> you're<00:02:09.239> also<00:02:09.360> paying<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
heavier but you're also paying a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.039 
heavier but you're also paying a
price<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.920> those<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:12.330> looking<00:02:12.599> at<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> size

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
price for those just looking at the size

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.100 
price for those just looking at the size
of<00:02:13.260> these<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.830> delivers<00:02:14.489> great<00:02:15.180> base<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:16.019> you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
of these it delivers great base that you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
of these it delivers great base that you
probably<00:02:16.319> wouldn't<00:02:16.620> expect<00:02:16.739> from<00:02:17.099> them<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
probably wouldn't expect from them the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.460 
probably wouldn't expect from them the
mids<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.150> highs<00:02:18.239> are<00:02:18.689> also<00:02:18.840> very<00:02:19.230> similar

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
mids and highs are also very similar

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.470 
mids and highs are also very similar
which<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.250> something<00:02:20.459> you'd<00:02:20.819> expect<00:02:20.939> out<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
which is something you'd expect out of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.619 
which is something you'd expect out of
the<00:02:21.689> bigger<00:02:21.900> beats<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.640> why<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
the bigger beats and that is why the

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.440 
the bigger beats and that is why the
smaller<00:02:24.959> ie<00:02:25.680> twos<00:02:26.129> are<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:27.120> impressive

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
smaller ie twos are so impressive

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720 
smaller ie twos are so impressive
another<00:02:28.140> thing<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.650> about<00:02:28.680> these<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.340> that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
another thing I like about these is that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.250 
another thing I like about these is that
you<00:02:29.790> don't<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.150> worry<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:30.480> your<00:02:30.930> music

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
you don't have to worry about your music

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.170 
you don't have to worry about your music
getting<00:02:31.440> staticky<00:02:32.099> when<00:02:32.370> listening<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:33.000> high

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
getting staticky when listening at high

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.479 
getting staticky when listening at high
