h9s that's not there and then this

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.580 
h9s that's not there and then this
little<00:04:35.490> gray<00:04:35.700> thing<00:04:35.940> on<00:04:36.030> top<00:04:36.270> h9s<00:04:37.260> don't<00:04:37.440> have

their<00:04:40.410> extra<00:04:40.620> at<00:04:40.800> light<00:04:40.980> output<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:43.260> also<00:04:43.410> I

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
their extra at light output but also I

00:04:43.590 --> 00:05:10.730 
their extra at light output but also I
believe<00:04:43.970> h9s<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.060> also<00:04:45.180> 65<00:04:45.840> watt<00:04:46.170> or<00:04:46.380> 60<00:04:46.920> watt

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
let's go it's fused box from I'm

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.339 
let's go it's fused box from I'm
right-handed<00:05:33.119> it<00:05:33.689> makes<00:05:33.959> a<00:05:34.050> little<00:05:34.259> bit

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
right-handed it makes a little bit

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:49.429 
right-handed it makes a little bit
harder<00:05:42.649> there<00:05:43.649> we<00:05:43.769> go<00:05:44.089> there<00:05:45.229> clip<00:05:46.229> down<00:05:48.439> let's

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
harder there we go there clip down let's

00:05:49.439 --> 00:06:02.689 
harder there we go there clip down let's

of tight cuz the o-ring kind of pulls it

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.769 
of tight cuz the o-ring kind of pulls it
in<00:06:05.959> and<00:06:06.959> there<00:06:07.110> we<00:06:07.229> go
