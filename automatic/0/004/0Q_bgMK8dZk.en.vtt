00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 good friends then welcome again 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.359
 to another video of the narcos channel in this 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
 occasion we will comment on the purchase 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.670
 of two players who has made the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 Real Madrid because these two players 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 are jaime rodríguez and chicharito 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.460
 Hernandez out there what does not convince me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.350
 It is still that Jaime Rodriguez already has 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 approximately four weeks and we 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
 they showed up against Real Madrid wearing a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.220
 goal has not been seen a game then a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.800
 spectacular game of what was expected 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 of this player I also want to comment 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.570
 that a player who carries then that carries 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.329
 his team until the second round and not 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.969
 manages to pass before a very poor Brazil 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.879
 but very poor this means that there 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 some problem the chicharito hernandez 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.980
 we all know in mexico we know that the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 chicharito then is the football chanfle 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.280
 world 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.649
 is a player who fails a lot who has 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.109
 many goal options but not the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.789
 usually not materialize concrete has 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.469
 made two goals with Real Madrid 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.030
 but this still does not mean anything 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 is just starting to play in real 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 madrid we can not take the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.690
 bells on the fly by 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.760
 two goals already the pea is one of the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.280
 The best players in the world must see 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.500
 all your background and know that the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 pea is a player who fails the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 goal options frequently then 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 if two players like these arrive at 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.440
 soccer to football quality as is the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 Real Madrid and Spanish football as there 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.750
 some problem and this problem is that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.180
 there is currently a war between 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 barcelona and the real madrid to obtain 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 the sale of t - shirts in mexico 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.790
 then what would be the part 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.119
 marketing of selling the shirts 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.300
 Well, the most obvious thing would be to hire 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.800
 the most famous player in mexico in this 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.990
 case is chicharito hernández 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.030
 ask every child what their 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.500
 favorite player and they'll tell you it's the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.080
 chicharito hernandez any child 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.000
 Mexican can tell you that then by 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.369
 there goes the marketing part also not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.140
 only the sporting part where 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.660
 the real madrid is seeing that the sale 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.820
 of shirts throughout Mexico is a 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.830
 round business we are also seeing 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.050
 that people here in mexico no longer 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.710
 you see the mx league because it's a very league 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.780
 poor 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.340
 too poor in terms of level 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 football I'm not talking 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.890
 economically if not footballically it is 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 a league that does not show much then 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.000
 that's why Spanish football has 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.010
 realized that in Mexico it is a market 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.810
 very powerful where you can sell him 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.120
 t-shirts to everyone and that the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.190
 barcelona is why he is entering 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 in Mexico this has a sponsorship of 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.480
 certain company then do not see 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.820
 only the sports part but the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.800
 mercadológica part where the pea 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.920
 Hernandez can be said that it was 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.530
 hired to sell shirts here in 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.680
 Mexico potentially very large market 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.230
 a market that the consumer very 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.170
 consumerist almost equal to that of 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.820
 the us then I think if you have 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.950
 a market like this you have the option of 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.450
 exploit it, you're going to exploit it and that's what 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 is doing the real madrid- with jaime 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.460
 Rodriguez we have the player that 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.610
 they paid 80 million and that came up 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.010
 eighths I do not think it's a player a 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.400
 crack has not shown much in the real 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.420
 madrid but 80 million and good of those 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.000
 80 million have paid for it 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.160
 the man has scored six goals in cups 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.170
 of the world but I do not think that also that 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.790
 Real Madrid is watching that part 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.060
 sports because he is a player who carries 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.420
 up to eighths nobody really a club 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.180
 prestige is launched to hire a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.709
 player who has six goals there and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.750
 that his team has reached eighth 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.850
 of final against a very poor team like 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.980
 is the one from Brazil that we already saw the goliza 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.069
 that got him germany that got him 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.019
 germany then I also think that by 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.680
 there goes the marketing part where 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.590
 the peas are therefore representing 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.130
 it's okay is opening towards him towards 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.470
 he towards the Mexican market then 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.900
 james rodríguez would be the opening towards 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.980
 he towards the Latin market are not 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.319
 players that show a lot 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.110
 that's why I've always said that 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:17.070
 lionel messi is the total emblem of 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.049
 market of that market the clubs of 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.620
 so big market that clubs have 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.090
 where then the sale of 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.220
 t-shirts advertising sale 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.800
 sale of sponsorships that the street itself 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.360
 the quality of Leonel soccer 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.210
 messi we saw it in the world cup a 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.639
 very very complacent player very very left 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.800
 in final the world cup final 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.130
 It seemed like I needed him playing a 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.220
 friendly we also saw the big lie 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.810
 of the fifa where leonel messi receives 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.449
 totally the prize when playing the best 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.699
 player of the world cup which was 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:55.800
 It was really a laugh 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.870
 we can call it no there are no words 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.850
 to call it what the fifa did as 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.669
 give is a player who did not show 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.340
 a lot when the Germans had between 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.860
 his players ranks like klose himself 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.020
 who could have taken the prize to 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.350
 player of the best player of the cup of 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.600
 world then 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.910
 what you have to see here is that you are 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.730
 seeing the market part then 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.830
 if we say that the pea is a 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.130
 great player for having done is 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.620
 so far two goals in the then 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.320
 against a poor team a team very 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.050
 half table then we can not say 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.600
 that the pea is here to talk 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.270
 but to hugo sanchez the players 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.860
 as ronaldo as the ronaldo the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.540
 Brazilian when I refer ronaldo 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.170
 I'm always going to refer to ronaldo the 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.700
 Brazilian to the other is another great aldo and 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.160
 let's see how these stand out 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.980
 players although the pea has already done 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.750
 two goals still and that's why I missed 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.520
 another in the previous match against the 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.200
 elche still the pea its as its 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.450
 statistics does not help much is a 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.960
 player with a lot of choice of goal not 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.060
 concrete mostly and james rodríguez is 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.120
 a very young player 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.840
 but you still do not see it yet take off 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.320
 is already relatively young for a crack 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.120
 that age is already when it's taking off already 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.330
 It takes four weeks in realmadrid and not 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.340
 He has finished off for while 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.600
 follow the sale of shirts there will be no 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.880
 no problem in which these players 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.300
 continue in Real Madrid for soccer 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.300
 Spanish
