figured<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.590> out<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.890> okay<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.489> figure

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
figured it out you okay now you figure

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.199 
figured it out you okay now you figure
it<00:04:02.910> out<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.959> remember<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.709> said<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.910> have

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
it out but remember what I said you have

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.990 
it out but remember what I said you have
a<00:04:06.450> model<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.590> reality<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.609> have<00:04:08.819> been

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
a model of reality that you have been

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.990 
a model of reality that you have been
living<00:04:09.359> by<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.930> what<00:04:10.170> has<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.590> happen<00:04:10.620> now<00:04:11.040> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
living by so what has to happen now it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.110 
living by so what has to happen now it
has<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.480> get<00:04:12.660> torn<00:04:13.079> down<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.280> that's<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.849> part

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
has to get torn down and that's the part

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.150 
has to get torn down and that's the part
that's<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.660> challenge<00:04:16.049> because<00:04:16.199> now<00:04:16.829> you<00:04:16.889> have

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
that's a challenge because now you have

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.150 
that's a challenge because now you have
to<00:04:17.340> ride<00:04:17.849> it<00:04:18.120> out<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.570> gotta<00:04:18.780> wait<00:04:19.139> for<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.950> to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
to ride it out you gotta wait for it to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.680 
to ride it out you gotta wait for it to
sometimes<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.820> might<00:04:20.970> take<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.239> little<00:04:21.450> while

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
sometimes it might take a little while

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.650 
sometimes it might take a little while
so<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:21.959> if<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.410> thought<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.889> it's<00:04:23.130> up<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.400> you

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
so that if I thought this it's up to you

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.940 
so that if I thought this it's up to you
it's<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.750> interference<00:04:25.440> patterns<00:04:25.860> that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
it's the interference patterns that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.339 
it's the interference patterns that
we've<00:04:26.160> talked<00:04:26.310> about<00:04:26.490> these<00:04:26.760> classes<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:28.110> run

oh yeah I know it's changing oh no I
don't<00:04:34.860> know<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:35.400> should<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.639> do<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.030> then<00:04:36.150> you

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
don't know what should I do and then you

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.270 
don't know what should I do and then you
dip<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.169> start<00:04:37.440> doing<00:04:37.710> all<00:04:37.830> kinds<00:04:38.220> of

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
dip in and start doing all kinds of

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.550 
dip in and start doing all kinds of
stuff<00:04:38.550> then<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.120> then<00:04:39.389> then<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.810> slow<00:04:40.169> up<00:04:40.410> to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
stuff then you then then you slow up to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.830 
stuff then you then then you slow up to
change<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.430> then<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.760> decide<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.270> stop<00:04:42.510> again

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
change so then you decide to stop again

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.140 
change so then you decide to stop again
so<00:04:43.500> then<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.860> art<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.669> seems<00:04:44.849> like<00:04:44.910> it's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
so then you art it so it seems like it's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.790 
so then you art it so it seems like it's
taken<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.510> lot<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:46.080> gotta<00:04:46.289> be<00:04:46.500> able<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.710> walk

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
taken a lot you gotta be able to walk

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.140 
taken a lot you gotta be able to walk
walk<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.490> fling

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
walk that fling

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.289 
walk that fling
so<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.870> got<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.169> be<00:04:49.260> a
