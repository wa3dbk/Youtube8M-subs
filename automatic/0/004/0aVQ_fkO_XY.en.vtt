hi everyone this is tall T and this is

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.400 
hi everyone this is tall T and this is
one<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.879> polymer<00:00:03.270> clay<00:00:03.419> basic<00:00:03.990> videos

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
one of the polymer clay basic videos

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.889 
one of the polymer clay basic videos
that<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.710> have<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:05.250> doing<00:00:05.430> lately<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.480> video

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
that I have been doing lately this video

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.360 
that I have been doing lately this video
is<00:00:06.960> going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.830> breaking<00:00:08.340> your

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
is going to be about breaking your

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.610 
is going to be about breaking your
polymer<00:00:08.880> clay<00:00:09.030> while<00:00:09.750> baking<00:00:10.170> your<00:00:10.290> polymer

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
polymer clay while baking your polymer

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.549 
polymer clay while baking your polymer
clay<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.070> very<00:00:11.639> important<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.840> preserve<00:00:13.200> your

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
clay is very important to preserve your

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.700 
clay is very important to preserve your
polymer<00:00:13.889> clay<00:00:14.160> over<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> years<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.529> well<00:00:16.529> I

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
polymer clay over the years and well I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.910 
polymer clay over the years and well I
have<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.039> example<00:00:17.340> here<00:00:18.529> when<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> first

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
have an example here when I first

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
have an example here when I first
started<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.670> didn't<00:00:21.060> know<00:00:21.090> how<00:00:21.390> important<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
started I didn't know how important it

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
started I didn't know how important it
was<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> make<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.830> polymer<00:00:23.220> clay<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
was to make my polymer clay for the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.970 
was to make my polymer clay for the
right<00:00:24.150> time<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> right<00:00:25.410> temperature

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
right time and at the right temperature

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.689 
right time and at the right temperature
so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> under<00:00:27.210> baked<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.699> bake

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
so I under baked it a little bit I bake

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
so I under baked it a little bit I bake
them<00:00:29.910> only<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.510> couple<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> minutes<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
them only for a couple of minutes and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.400 
them only for a couple of minutes and
they<00:00:31.769> seemed<00:00:32.070> fine<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:32.870> they<00:00:33.870> that's

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
they seemed fine at first they that's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.920 
they seemed fine at first they that's
because<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.100> plasticizer<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.180> baked<00:00:36.600> from

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
because the plasticizer is baked from

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.740 
because the plasticizer is baked from
the<00:00:37.079> surface<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.770> will<00:00:38.550> explain<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> little<00:00:39.420> bit

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the surface I will explain a little bit

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
the surface I will explain a little bit
more<00:00:40.140> about<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> make<00:00:41.129> my<00:00:41.370> one

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
more about it when I make my one

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.080 
more about it when I make my one
teaspoon<00:00:42.329> mud<00:00:42.540> clay<00:00:42.750> tutorial<00:00:43.379> or

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
teaspoon mud clay tutorial or

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
teaspoon mud clay tutorial or
explanation<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.520> surface<00:00:47.520> gets<00:00:47.820> picked

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
explanation so the surface gets picked

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
explanation so the surface gets picked
first<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.840> while<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.500> might<00:00:49.649> seem<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
first and while it might seem that it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.029 
first and while it might seem that it
has<00:00:50.879> been<00:00:51.090> baked<00:00:51.420> completely<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.739> fine

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
has been baked completely and it's fine

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.029 
has been baked completely and it's fine
the<00:00:53.879> center<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> still<00:00:54.899> raw<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> still<00:00:55.800> has

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the center is still raw and still has

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
the center is still raw and still has
plasticizer<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> over<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> years<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.410> will

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
plasticizer and over the years it will

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
plasticizer and over the years it will
move<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> center<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> surface<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
move from the center to the surface and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.200 
move from the center to the surface and
it<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.039> whole<00:01:02.399> piece<00:01:02.699> brittle

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it will make your whole piece brittle

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.380 
it will make your whole piece brittle
and<00:01:03.390> Indian<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.439> crumble<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.909> takes

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and Indian it will crumble it takes

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
and Indian it will crumble it takes
about<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:07.080> year<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:08.159> years<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
about a year or maybe two years it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
about a year or maybe two years it
happened<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.540> pieces<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> first

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
happened to these pieces when I first

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.429 
happened to these pieces when I first
started<00:01:11.280> after<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.760> year<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.320> they<00:01:13.320> are

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
started after a year and they are

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.249 
started after a year and they are
extremely<00:01:13.799> brittle<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:15.330> crumble<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.080> like

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
extremely brittle they crumble just like

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.460 
extremely brittle they crumble just like
that<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.290> happen

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that and you don't want this to happen

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
that and you don't want this to happen
to<00:01:19.770> your<00:01:19.920> clay<00:01:20.220> especially<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.180> you're

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to your clay especially if you're

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
to your clay especially if you're
selling<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:21.930> work<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
selling your work you will want it to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.050 
selling your work you will want it to
last<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.180> many<00:01:24.360> many<00:01:24.540> years

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
last for many many years

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.440 
last for many many years
look<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.200> crumble<00:01:29.450> these

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
look how we see they just crumble these

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.980 
look how we see they just crumble these
don't<00:01:30.930> work<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.579> trash<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
don't work these are just trash but I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
don't work these are just trash but I
keep<00:01:34.200> them<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.650> reminder<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> don't

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
keep them as a reminder of what I don't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.649 
keep them as a reminder of what I don't
have<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> doesn't<00:01:39.119> happen<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
have to do so so this doesn't happen to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
have to do so so this doesn't happen to
you<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.500> show<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> make<00:01:41.520> your

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you I will show you how to make your

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.230 
you I will show you how to make your
polymer<00:01:42.090> clay<00:01:42.240> properly<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.549> do

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
polymer clay properly what I do is I do

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
polymer clay properly what I do is I do
my<00:01:45.390> work<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> small<00:01:46.320> pieces<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:47.009> recycled

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
my work on a small pieces of recycled

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
my work on a small pieces of recycled
paper<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.320> choose<00:01:49.560> any

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
paper like this you can choose any

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.399 
paper like this you can choose any
surface<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.759> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.299> work<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.750> some

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
surface that you want to work on some

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.740 
surface that you want to work on some
people<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.159> ceramic<00:01:53.790> tiles<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
people like to use ceramic tiles and I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.830 
people like to use ceramic tiles and I
think<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.380> brilliant<00:01:55.500> idea<00:01:56.299> but<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.540> just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
think that's a brilliant idea but I just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.510 
think that's a brilliant idea but I just
like<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> recycle<00:01:58.409> these<00:01:58.770> pieces<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.280> paper

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
like to recycle these pieces of paper

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.709 
like to recycle these pieces of paper
after<00:01:59.820> your<00:02:00.600> work<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> done<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:02.479> transport<00:02:03.479> them

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
after your work is done i transport them

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.280 
after your work is done i transport them
to<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.439> baking<00:02:04.890> tray<00:02:05.210> your<00:02:06.210> baking<00:02:06.719> tray<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
to my baking tray your baking tray can

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.290 
to my baking tray your baking tray can
be<00:02:07.350> anything<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.399> recommend<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
be anything but I do recommend that you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.450 
be anything but I do recommend that you
clip<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> only<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.920> polymer<00:02:11.310> clay<00:02:11.370> just

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
clip it only for polymer clay just

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.550 
clip it only for polymer clay just
safety<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.140> video<00:02:14.350> about

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
safety and I will make a video about

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.700 
safety and I will make a video about
animal<00:02:15.190> play<00:02:15.400> safety<00:02:15.880> -<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.470> very

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
animal play safety - this is just a very

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.610 
animal play safety - this is just a very
cheap<00:02:18.040> recycled<00:02:18.880> right<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.600> found<00:02:19.930> this

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
cheap recycled right that I found this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.830 
cheap recycled right that I found this
was<00:02:20.920> from<00:02:21.160> an<00:02:21.310> old<00:02:21.460> herb<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.240> doesn't<00:02:22.780> need

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
was from an old herb and it doesn't need

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.960 
was from an old herb and it doesn't need
to<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.170> anything<00:02:23.440> fancy<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.250> if<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.580> decide

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to be anything fancy and if you decide

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.780 
to be anything fancy and if you decide
to<00:02:25.180> use<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:26.230> polymer<00:02:26.680> clay<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.100> for<00:02:27.580> food

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
to use it for polymer clay and for food

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.010 
to use it for polymer clay and for food
as<00:02:27.970> well<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:29.470> recommend<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:31.020> put

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
as well I really recommend that you put

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.170 
as well I really recommend that you put
something<00:02:32.620> between<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.400> tray<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
something between the tray and the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.510 
something between the tray and the
polymer<00:02:34.510> clay<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:35.770> safety<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.250> don't

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
polymer clay just for safety you don't

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.910 
polymer clay just for safety you don't
want<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.850> plasticizer<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.870> move<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.350> from<00:02:38.710> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
want the plasticizer to move to from the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.770 
want the plasticizer to move to from the
polymer<00:02:39.190> clay<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.700> tray<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.300> then<00:02:40.540> to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
polymer clay to the tray and then to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.260 
polymer clay to the tray and then to
your<00:02:40.900> food<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:42.190> course<00:02:42.460> you<00:02:42.670> will<00:02:42.850> also<00:02:42.940> need

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
your food of course you will also need

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.840 
your food of course you will also need
an<00:02:43.480> oven<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:45.160> here<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.550> my<00:02:45.700> oven<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.920> need

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
an oven and here is my oven you need

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.980 
an oven and here is my oven you need
either<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.950> convention<00:02:51.330> conventional<00:02:52.330> oven<00:02:52.750> or

Juke can't make your polymer clay in a
microwave<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.630> packages<00:02:59.260> say<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.560> with

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
microwave in the packages say so with

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.640 
microwave in the packages say so with
capital<00:03:01.360> letters<00:03:01.720> because<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:02.380> that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
capital letters because it's that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.600 
capital letters because it's that
important<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:04.870> like<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.380> bake<00:03:05.920> mine<00:03:06.280> in

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
important I really like to bake mine in

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.440 
important I really like to bake mine in
convection<00:03:07.390> bake<00:03:07.950> because<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.580> airflow

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
convection bake because the airflow

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.630 
convection bake because the airflow
keeps<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.350> temperature<00:03:11.860> more<00:03:12.160> even<00:03:12.490> and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
keeps the temperature more even and

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.330 
keeps the temperature more even and
that's<00:03:12.940> just<00:03:13.330> another<00:03:14.230> assurance<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.130> your

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
that's just another assurance that your

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.550 
that's just another assurance that your
polymer<00:03:15.580> clay<00:03:15.820> won't<00:03:16.210> bore<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.140> will<00:03:17.350> bake

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
polymer clay won't bore and it will bake

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.850 
polymer clay won't bore and it will bake
properly<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:19.180> temperature<00:03:19.840> will<00:03:20.110> be<00:03:20.140> decided

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
properly the temperature will be decided

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.420 
properly the temperature will be decided
by<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.070> one<00:03:21.460> that<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.910> use<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.860> really<00:03:24.220> need

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
by the one that you use you really need

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.460 
by the one that you use you really need
to<00:03:24.670> make<00:03:24.790> sure<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.810> bake<00:03:25.990> your<00:03:26.170> polymer

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
to make sure that you bake your polymer

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.550 
to make sure that you bake your polymer
clay<00:03:26.680> at<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.130> right<00:03:27.310> temperature

for a slightly longer time I know that

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.210 
for a slightly longer time I know that
some<00:03:51.610> people<00:03:51.970> go<00:03:52.150> up<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:53.560> an<00:03:53.680> hour<00:03:53.860> just

some people go up to a to an hour just

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
to make sure that they reach out well

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.520 
to make sure that they reach out well
the<00:03:56.950> day<00:03:57.130> bit<00:03:57.460> of<00:03:57.700> all<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.540> plasticizer<00:03:59.140> from

the day bit of all the plasticizer from

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.410 
the day bit of all the plasticizer from
the<00:03:59.680> polymer<00:04:00.010> clay<00:04:00.160> that's<00:04:00.940> your<00:04:01.240> decision

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the polymer clay that's your decision

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.710 
the polymer clay that's your decision
and<00:04:01.960> I<00:04:02.740> find<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.130> some<00:04:03.490> pieces<00:04:03.790> tend<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.570> get

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
and I find that some pieces tend to get

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.050 
and I find that some pieces tend to get
a<00:04:04.930> slightly<00:04:05.230> darker<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:06.430> longer<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.880> bake

here<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:19.829> can<00:04:20.009> use<00:04:20.219> of<00:04:20.549> course<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:21.090> smaller

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
here you can use of course a smaller

here you can use of course a smaller
oven<00:04:22.379> -<00:04:22.710> actually<00:04:23.430> very<00:04:23.639> large<00:04:23.879> but<00:04:24.659> I<00:04:24.689> also

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
oven - actually very large but I also

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.459 
oven - actually very large but I also
use<00:04:25.349> it<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.860> bake<00:04:26.189> food<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.659> don't<00:04:28.289> have<00:04:28.439> a

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
use it to bake food so I don't have a

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.529 
use it to bake food so I don't have a
problem<00:04:28.770> with<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.580> know<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:30.029> a<00:04:30.240> lot<00:04:30.360> of

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
problem with that I know that a lot of

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.920 
problem with that I know that a lot of
people<00:04:31.020> are<00:04:31.199> scared<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.949> doing<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:32.930> decide

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
people are scared of doing it so decide

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.959 
people are scared of doing it so decide
what's<00:04:34.169> best<00:04:34.289> for<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.069> will<00:04:35.430> include<00:04:35.699> that

what's best for you I will include that

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.239 
what's best for you I will include that
in<00:04:36.210> my<00:04:36.240> polymer<00:04:36.749> clay<00:04:36.900> safety<00:04:37.469> video<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.039> I

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:38.249 
in my polymer clay safety video and I

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:40.279 
in my polymer clay safety video and I
also<00:04:38.430> really<00:04:38.939> really<00:04:38.969> really<00:04:39.509> recommend<00:04:39.779> that

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
recommend that you get an oven

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.629 
recommend that you get an oven
thermometer<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:46.800> should<00:04:47.039> be<00:04:47.219> cheap<00:04:47.520> enough

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
thermometer this should be cheap enough

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.320 
thermometer this should be cheap enough
I<00:04:48.469> have<00:04:49.469> been<00:04:49.620> using<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.189> since<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.699> began<00:04:50.879> and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
I have been using this since I began and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.170 
I have been using this since I began and
it's<00:04:52.080> very<00:04:52.439> important<00:04:53.069> because<00:04:53.250> sometimes

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
it's very important because sometimes

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.490 
it's very important because sometimes
the<00:04:54.449> dial<00:04:54.810> from<00:04:54.960> your<00:04:56.029> oven<00:04:57.029> is<00:04:57.479> not<00:04:57.810> accurate

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
the dial from your oven is not accurate

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.100 
the dial from your oven is not accurate
actually<00:04:59.490> if<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.789> place<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.240> right<00:05:00.419> here<00:05:00.840> it

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
actually if I place it right here it

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.649 
actually if I place it right here it
will<00:05:01.710> be<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.039> temperature<00:05:02.370> for<00:05:02.789> sculpey<00:05:03.360> so

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
will be the temperature for sculpey so

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.950 
will be the temperature for sculpey so
this<00:05:03.930> is<00:05:04.139> 50<00:05:04.979> degrees<00:05:05.370> lower<00:05:05.669> than<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
this is 50 degrees lower than the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.879 
this is 50 degrees lower than the
temperature<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.580> says<00:05:08.849> here<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:10.289> to<00:05:10.740> make

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
temperature that it says here so to make

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.499 
temperature that it says here so to make
sure<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.370> you're<00:05:11.550> baking<00:05:11.879> it<00:05:11.969> at<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.360> right

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
sure that you're baking it at the right

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.689 
sure that you're baking it at the right
temperature<00:05:12.659> get<00:05:13.439> an<00:05:13.620> oven<00:05:13.949> thermometer

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
temperature get an oven thermometer

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.329 
temperature get an oven thermometer
I<00:05:15.169> really<00:05:16.169> don't<00:05:16.379> pick<00:05:16.620> my<00:05:16.889> polymer<00:05:17.310> clay

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
I really don't pick my polymer clay

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.999 
I really don't pick my polymer clay
unless<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.419> is<00:05:18.659> there<00:05:18.930> because<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.680> dial

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
unless this is there because the dial

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.629 
unless this is there because the dial
sometimes<00:05:20.550> moves<00:05:20.879> up<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.569> down<00:05:21.659> so<00:05:22.199> I<00:05:22.610> like<00:05:23.610> to

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
sometimes moves up and down so I like to

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.450 
sometimes moves up and down so I like to
place<00:05:23.969> it<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.419> back<00:05:24.569> this<00:05:25.409> oven<00:05:25.650> has<00:05:26.219> the

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
place it in the back this oven has the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.510 
place it in the back this oven has the
heat<00:05:26.819> element<00:05:27.300> on<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.779> top<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:28.199> also<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:29.310> the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
heat element on the top and also on the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.320 
heat element on the top and also on the
bottom<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.719> find<00:05:31.080> that<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.770> heat<00:05:32.400> from<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
bottom and I find that the heat from the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.439 
bottom and I find that the heat from the
top<00:05:33.599> can<00:05:33.990> actually<00:05:34.560> burn<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.819> darken<00:05:36.419> your

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
top can actually burn and darken your

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.899 
top can actually burn and darken your
polymer<00:05:36.960> clay<00:05:37.080> is<00:05:37.349> slightly<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.979> know<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.879> a

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
polymer clay is slightly I know that a

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.389 
polymer clay is slightly I know that a
lot<00:05:39.330> of<00:05:39.360> players<00:05:39.810> do<00:05:40.169> different<00:05:40.620> things<00:05:40.710> what

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.399 
lot of players do different things what

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.649 
lot of players do different things what
I<00:05:41.430> do<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:42.149> I<00:05:42.599> just<00:05:43.110> made<00:05:43.919> a<00:05:43.949> small<00:05:44.389> folded<00:05:45.389> piece

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
I do is I just made a small folded piece

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.149 
I do is I just made a small folded piece
of<00:05:45.689> aluminum<00:05:46.500> and<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:48.120> use<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.139> as<00:05:49.469> a<00:05:49.529> small<00:05:49.860> tent

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
of aluminum and I use it as a small tent

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.469 
of aluminum and I use it as a small tent
that<00:05:51.060> way<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:52.430> heat<00:05:53.430> element<00:05:53.639> from<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.240> top

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
that way the heat element from the top

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.860 
that way the heat element from the top
won't<00:05:54.990> make<00:05:55.439> such<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.800> hard<00:05:56.339> and<00:05:56.580> direct<00:05:57.120> heat

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
won't make such a hard and direct heat

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.889 
won't make such a hard and direct heat
to<00:05:58.349> my<00:05:58.500> polymer<00:05:58.919> clay<00:05:58.949> and<00:05:59.449> the<00:06:00.449> heat<00:06:00.659> will

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:00.899 
to my polymer clay and the heat will

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:03.170 
to my polymer clay and the heat will
actually<00:06:01.469> come<00:06:01.680> from<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:02.189> air<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.969> the

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
actually come from the air that the

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.019 
actually come from the air that the
convection<00:06:03.599> oven<00:06:03.960> will<00:06:04.379> keep<00:06:04.680> nice<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.789> even

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
convection oven will keep nice and even

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.200 
convection oven will keep nice and even
all<00:06:06.180> around<00:06:06.270> my<00:06:07.199> oven<00:06:07.770> and<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.639> makes<00:06:09.029> my

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
all around my oven and that makes my

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.269 
all around my oven and that makes my
polymer<00:06:09.569> clay<00:06:09.719> quite<00:06:10.080> nicely<00:06:10.379> if<00:06:10.800> you<00:06:11.069> don't

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
polymer clay quite nicely if you don't

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.399 
polymer clay quite nicely if you don't
have<00:06:11.550> a<00:06:11.819> convection<00:06:12.300> oven<00:06:12.629> you<00:06:12.960> can<00:06:12.990> use<00:06:13.379> a

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
have a convection oven you can use a

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.149 
have a convection oven you can use a
conventional<00:06:14.189> oven<00:06:14.879> of<00:06:15.779> course<00:06:15.810> or<00:06:16.349> just<00:06:16.860> put

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
conventional oven of course or just put

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.399 
conventional oven of course or just put
it<00:06:17.279> in<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.550> warm<00:06:17.789> setting<00:06:18.089> it<00:06:18.479> will<00:06:18.839> bake<00:06:19.080> -

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
it in the warm setting it will bake -

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.769 
it in the warm setting it will bake -
just<00:06:20.099> make<00:06:20.250> sure<00:06:20.430> that<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.939> temperature<00:06:21.270> is

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
just make sure that the temperature is

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.089 
just make sure that the temperature is
right

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
right

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.999 
right
and<00:06:23.339> of<00:06:24.150> course<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.569> time<00:06:24.809> has<00:06:25.199> to<00:06:25.229> be<00:06:25.439> right<00:06:25.740> -

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
and of course the time has to be right -

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.299 
and of course the time has to be right -
at<00:06:26.279> first<00:06:26.669> I<00:06:26.879> was<00:06:27.059> scared<00:06:27.539> that<00:06:28.199> this<00:06:28.650> little

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:29.309 
at first I was scared that this little

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:32.959 
at first I was scared that this little
tent<00:06:29.610> it's<00:06:30.150> very<00:06:30.509> light<00:06:31.439> so<00:06:32.099> I<00:06:32.129> was<00:06:32.339> astir<00:06:32.729> that

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
tent it's very light so I was astir that

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.809 
tent it's very light so I was astir that
it<00:06:33.119> will<00:06:33.360> be<00:06:33.569> blown<00:06:34.080> off<00:06:34.319> by<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.830> pan<00:06:35.490> from<00:06:35.759> the

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
it will be blown off by the pan from the

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.559 
it will be blown off by the pan from the
convection<00:06:36.270> become<00:06:37.199> the<00:06:37.499> fan<00:06:37.740> is<00:06:37.860> right<00:06:38.039> here

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
convection become the fan is right here

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:43.159 
convection become the fan is right here
so<00:06:39.569> I<00:06:39.899> made<00:06:40.469> a<00:06:40.800> small<00:06:41.580> armature<00:06:42.210> with<00:06:42.509> wire<00:06:42.779> and

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
so I made a small armature with wire and

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.999 
so I made a small armature with wire and
I<00:06:43.619> covered<00:06:43.919> it<00:06:44.099> with<00:06:44.430> foil<00:06:44.819> and<00:06:45.589> this<00:06:46.589> is<00:06:46.770> also

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
I covered it with foil and this is also

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.700 
I covered it with foil and this is also
nice<00:06:47.460> if<00:06:47.819> you<00:06:48.089> need<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.479> adjust<00:06:48.569> it<00:06:49.050> or<00:06:49.319> I<00:06:49.379> can

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
nice if you need to adjust it or I can

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.100 
nice if you need to adjust it or I can
even<00:06:50.009> hang<00:06:50.309> things<00:06:50.669> from<00:06:50.969> the<00:06:51.119> top<00:06:51.330> wire<00:06:51.659> to

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
even hang things from the top wire to

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.239 
even hang things from the top wire to
bake<00:06:53.300> but<00:06:54.300> this<00:06:55.050> doesn't<00:06:55.559> get<00:06:55.649> blown<00:06:55.949> either

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:56.249 
bake but this doesn't get blown either

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.399 
bake but this doesn't get blown either
so<00:06:56.580> you<00:06:56.699> can<00:06:56.849> make<00:06:57.029> either<00:06:57.330> of<00:06:57.539> the<00:06:57.689> two<00:06:57.899> and

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409 
so you can make either of the two and

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.249 
so you can make either of the two and
that's<00:06:59.339> pretty<00:06:59.550> much<00:06:59.819> how<00:07:00.149> I<00:07:00.180> bake<00:07:00.569> my<00:07:00.599> polymer

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 
that's pretty much how I bake my polymer

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:03.559 
that's pretty much how I bake my polymer
clay<00:07:01.289> you<00:07:01.710> really<00:07:02.550> need<00:07:02.729> to<00:07:02.969> follow<00:07:03.210> the

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
clay you really need to follow the

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.989 
clay you really need to follow the
instructions<00:07:03.599> in<00:07:04.439> the<00:07:04.680> package<00:07:05.129> make<00:07:05.789> sure

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:05.999 
instructions in the package make sure

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:07.339 
instructions in the package make sure
that<00:07:06.210> you<00:07:06.360> are<00:07:06.449> baking<00:07:06.659> it<00:07:06.839> at<00:07:07.050> the<00:07:07.199> right

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:07.349 
that you are baking it at the right

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.429 
that you are baking it at the right
temperature<00:07:07.559> for<00:07:08.309> the<00:07:08.460> right<00:07:08.669> amount<00:07:08.849> of<00:07:09.149> time

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:09.439 
temperature for the right amount of time

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.679 
temperature for the right amount of time
otherwise<00:07:10.439> these<00:07:11.249> will<00:07:11.309> happen<00:07:11.969> to<00:07:12.120> you<00:07:12.270> -<00:07:12.449> I

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:12.689 
otherwise these will happen to you - I

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:14.449 
otherwise these will happen to you - I
speak<00:07:13.499> from<00:07:13.740> experience

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:14.459 
speak from experience

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:18.309 
speak from experience
so<00:07:15.229> how<00:07:16.229> brittle<00:07:16.649> it<00:07:16.800> is<00:07:16.830> it's<00:07:17.189> really<00:07:17.490> awful

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 
so how brittle it is it's really awful

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.019 
so how brittle it is it's really awful
let<00:07:19.319> me<00:07:19.439> know<00:07:19.589> if<00:07:19.800> it<00:07:19.979> was<00:07:20.249> helpful<00:07:20.550> for<00:07:20.849> you
