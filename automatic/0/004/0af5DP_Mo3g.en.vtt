00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
there is the range of the long barrel

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.099 
there is the range of the long barrel
now<00:01:47.219> that<00:01:47.880> line<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.359> see<00:01:48.539> right<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.079> where

now that line you see right there where
the<00:01:49.530> dead<00:01:49.710> body<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> range<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.179> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the dead body is was the range of the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.800 
the dead body is was the range of the
bare-bones<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.759> then<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bare-bones one and then so that's the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
bare-bones one and then so that's the
range<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> long<00:01:55.409> bear<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> long

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
range of the long bear with the long

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550 
range of the long bear with the long
barrel<00:01:56.399> attachment<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.119> reflex<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
barrel attachment now this is reflex so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
barrel attachment now this is reflex so
these<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.609> found<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.060> pretty<00:02:00.359> weird

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600

these the what we found is pretty weird
with<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:00.990> things<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.649> detachments<00:02:02.579> do

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
with these things the detachments do

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.599 
with these things the detachments do
make<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> huge<00:02:03.479> difference<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:05.159> range<00:02:05.429> of

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
make a huge difference on the range of

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.450 
make a huge difference on the range of
the<00:02:05.729> KSG<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.749> don't<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.649> what's<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.190> did

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
the KSG so I don't know what's they did

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.279 
the KSG so I don't know what's they did
to<00:02:08.670> make<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.970> such<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> big<00:02:09.660> difference<00:02:09.840> but

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to make it such a big difference but

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.800 
to make it such a big difference but
when<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.190> attach<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.670> reflex<00:02:12.420> sights<00:02:12.630> which

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
when you attach the reflex sights which

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.600 
when you attach the reflex sights which
are<00:02:12.930> watching<00:02:13.200> right<00:02:13.230> now<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.040> now<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.340> did

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
are watching right now and now we did

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.300 
are watching right now and now we did
test<00:02:14.850> them<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.090> different<00:02:15.210> ranges<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:16.740> we're

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
test them at different ranges but we're

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.430 
test them at different ranges but we're
trying<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.610> re<00:02:17.730> emulate<00:02:18.240> what<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> guy<00:02:18.840> had

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
trying to re emulate what the guy had

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.160 
trying to re emulate what the guy had
killed<00:02:19.770> me<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.069> first<00:02:20.280> clip<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.640> did<00:02:21.240> so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
killed me in the first clip that did so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.630 
killed me in the first clip that did so
now<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.350> going<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.590> run<00:02:22.770> up<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.069> I'm<00:02:23.460> gonna

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
now I'm going to go run up and I'm gonna

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.510 
now I'm going to go run up and I'm gonna
go<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.990> exactly<00:02:24.990> what<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.650> damage<00:02:26.010> was<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
go see exactly what the damage was and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240 
go see exactly what the damage was and
that<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.140> regular<00:02:28.560> one<00:02:28.740> was<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that was where the regular one was and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.030 
that was where the regular one was and
this<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.549> one<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.900> reflex<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
this is one with the reflex so the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.460 
this is one with the reflex so the
reflex<00:02:32.489> seems<00:02:33.390> like<00:02:33.629> what<00:02:33.870> happened<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
reflex seems like what happened with the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.820 
reflex seems like what happened with the
replay

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
replay

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.920 
replay
it<00:02:34.950> decreases<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.970> range<00:02:36.210> for<00:02:36.450> some<00:02:36.600> reason

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
it decreases the range for some reason

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.230 
it decreases the range for some reason
now<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.800> don't<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.490> works<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:38.850> this

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
now I don't know how that works but this

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.440 
now I don't know how that works but this
is<00:02:39.360> now<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.570> reflex<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:41.090> long<00:02:42.090> barrel

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
is now the reflex and the long barrel

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.990 
is now the reflex and the long barrel
which<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:43.130> little<00:02:44.130> bit<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.490> shocker<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.970> me

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
which is a little bit of a shocker to me

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.840 
which is a little bit of a shocker to me
but<00:02:45.360> actually<00:02:45.900> increases<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> range<00:02:46.860> like

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
but actually increases the range like

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.630 
but actually increases the range like
significant<00:02:48.630> amount<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:50.040> least<00:02:50.310> enough<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
significant amount at least enough to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
significant amount at least enough to
where<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.390> lease<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.810> head<00:02:52.200> shot

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
where you can the lease to head shot

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.020 
where you can the lease to head shot
someone<00:02:52.740> from<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.070> far<00:02:53.340> obviously<00:02:53.760> use<00:02:53.910> on

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
someone from that far obviously use on

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.780 
someone from that far obviously use on
the<00:02:54.120> coke<00:02:54.300> am<00:02:54.620> now<00:02:55.620> we're<00:02:56.280> gonna<00:02:56.370> go<00:02:56.550> try<00:02:56.760> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the coke am now we're gonna go try it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.850 
the coke am now we're gonna go try it
again<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.060> couple<00:02:57.270> more<00:02:57.510> times<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:58.470> did<00:02:58.620> try<00:02:58.740> a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
again a couple more times we did try a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.980 
again a couple more times we did try a
couple<00:02:59.040> different<00:02:59.160> things<00:02:59.490> but<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.600> tried<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
couple different things but we tried it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.620 
couple different things but we tried it
on<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.320> same<00:03:01.560> level<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.370> different<00:03:03.270> like

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
on the same level and different like

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.630 
on the same level and different like
areas<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.440> I'm<00:03:04.560> kind<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.130> around<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.460> same

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
areas but I'm kind of around the same

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.860 
areas but I'm kind of around the same
like<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.240> didn't<00:03:06.540> really<00:03:06.630> make<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
like but it didn't really make a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.090 
like but it didn't really make a
difference<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.530> best<00:03:07.710> way<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.010> can

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
difference this is the best way we can

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.850 
difference this is the best way we can
show<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.340> what<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> measurements<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.530> now

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
show you what the measurements so now

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.820 
show you what the measurements so now
we're<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.160> show<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.370> again<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.830> there

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
we're going to show you again and there

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.990 
we're going to show you again and there
you<00:03:13.920> go<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.250> look<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.520> hip<00:03:14.640> marker<00:03:14.910> right

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
you go see look at the hip marker right

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.090 
you go see look at the hip marker right
there<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.050> see<00:03:16.260> exactly<00:03:16.650> how

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
there and you can see exactly how

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.680 
there and you can see exactly how
ridiculous<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.910> range<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.390> don't<00:03:18.540> know<00:03:18.600> if

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
ridiculous the range is I don't know if

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.390 
ridiculous the range is I don't know if
this<00:03:18.810> guy's<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> bigger<00:03:19.680> shocker<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
this guy's is a bigger shocker to you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.190 
this guy's is a bigger shocker to you
guys<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.940> don't<00:03:21.450> even<00:03:21.540> know<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:21.690> anyone's<00:03:22.020> even

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
guys I don't even know if anyone's even

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.540 
guys I don't even know if anyone's even
use<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.470> cash<00:03:22.650> d<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.070> went<00:03:23.280> every<00:03:23.400> time<00:03:23.490> I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
use the cash d but I went every time I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.340 
use the cash d but I went every time I
run<00:03:23.700> into<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.720> possibly<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> most

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
run into it it is possibly the most

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.930 
run into it it is possibly the most
frustrating<00:03:25.650> thing<00:03:26.130> I've<00:03:26.250> ever<00:03:26.280> faced<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
frustrating thing I've ever faced in a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.480 
frustrating thing I've ever faced in a
video<00:03:27.150> game<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:28.380> calling<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:28.980> there<00:03:29.220> so

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
video game just calling it out there so

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.220 
video game just calling it out there so
hopefully<00:03:29.610> some<00:03:30.600> will<00:03:30.750> see<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:30.990> i'm<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
hopefully some will see now i'm going to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.620 
hopefully some will see now i'm going to
show<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.590> different<00:03:31.890> range<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.480> is

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
show you the different range and this is

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.310 
show you the different range and this is
where<00:03:34.730> hopefully<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.910> can<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.540> yellow

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
where hopefully you can see that yellow
