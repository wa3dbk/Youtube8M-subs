00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the xbox and ps3 and just go over my

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
thoughts on it and my thoughts on smg's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.590 
thoughts on it and my thoughts on smg's
because<00:00:50.430> smg's<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.059> probably<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> most

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
because smg's are probably the most

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840 
because smg's are probably the most
probably<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> best<00:00:52.710> class<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.699> watch

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
probably the best class for if you watch

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.150 
probably the best class for if you watch
my<00:00:54.030> videos<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.390> probably<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> rush

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
my videos you probably like to rush

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.200 
my videos you probably like to rush
probably<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.399> best<00:00:56.610> class<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:57.059> rushing

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
probably the best class we're rushing

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
probably the best class we're rushing
what<00:00:57.570> i'm<00:00:57.780> i've<00:00:58.500> been<00:00:58.710> thinking<00:00:59.100> about<00:00:59.190> using

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
what i'm i've been thinking about using

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.470 
what i'm i've been thinking about using
etc<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:01.340> what<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> thought<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
etc so um what I thought on this this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.160 
etc so um what I thought on this this
next<00:01:04.280> SMG<00:01:05.280> patch<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
next SMG patch is first of all they this

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.679 
next SMG patch is first of all they this
is<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.590> third<00:01:07.830> time<00:01:08.100> they've<00:01:08.340> nerfed<00:01:08.689> SMGs

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is the third time they've nerfed SMGs

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
is the third time they've nerfed SMGs
and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> third<00:01:10.530> time<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.979> buffed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and I think the third time they buffed

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030 
and I think the third time they buffed
LMG<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.290> did<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> first<00:01:13.740> patch

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
LMG so what they did in the first patch

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.719 
LMG so what they did in the first patch
I'm<00:01:14.369> pretty<00:01:14.700> sure<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> SMC<00:01:16.140> PDW<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.250> just

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I'm pretty sure with the SMC PDW or just

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.690 
I'm pretty sure with the SMC PDW or just
PDW<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.509> other<00:01:18.659> guns<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> mp7

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
PDW and some other guns like the mp7

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
PDW and some other guns like the mp7
they<00:01:20.700> added<00:01:21.000> some<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.360> recoil<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> gun

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
they added some more recoil to the gun

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.460 
they added some more recoil to the gun
more<00:01:22.920> visual<00:01:23.280> recoil<00:01:23.520> etc<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> second

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
more visual recoil etc in the second

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.490 
more visual recoil etc in the second
patch<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.130> made<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:27.390> SMGs<00:01:28.350> with

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
patch they made this SMGs with

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
patch they made this SMGs with
suppressors<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.220> made<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.490> very<00:01:29.759> weak

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
suppressors they made them very weak

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
suppressors they made them very weak
from<00:01:30.720> long<00:01:30.930> range<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.770> probably<00:01:31.950> smg's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
from long range they they probably smg's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
from long range they they probably smg's
practically<00:01:32.909> suck<00:01:33.150> long<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.659> long<00:01:33.960> range<00:01:34.200> now

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
practically suck long a long range now

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.999 
practically suck long a long range now
and<00:01:35.750> with<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.930> third<00:01:37.200> patch<00:01:37.530> they

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and with this third patch they

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
and with this third patch they
practically<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> PDW<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.509> practically

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
practically the PDW is practically

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
practically the PDW is practically
ruined<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.560> practically<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> very<00:01:42.090> good

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
ruined it's practically not a very good

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 
ruined it's practically not a very good
gun<00:01:42.450> from<00:01:42.720> medium<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> long<00:01:43.890> range<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.399> the

gun from medium to long range it's the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
gun from medium to long range it's the
only<00:01:44.610> good<00:01:44.729> short<00:01:45.030> range<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.170> what

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
only good short range now and so what

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.950 
only good short range now and so what
they<00:01:46.409> MSM<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.950> unless<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.250> run<00:01:47.520> grip<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.600> lot

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
they MSM see unless you run grip a lot

haven't been using the PD PDW much I've

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.460 
haven't been using the PD PDW much I've
been<00:02:38.080> going<00:02:38.680> straight<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> vector<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:41.320> my

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
been going straight to the vector in my

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.140 
been going straight to the vector in my
opinion<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.010> lot<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.280> people<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.730> lot<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.910> people

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.450 
opinion a lot of people a lot of people
say<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.360> mp7<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.080> best<00:02:44.290> gun<00:02:44.470> now<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.890> think

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
say the mp7 is the best gun now I think

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.550 
say the mp7 is the best gun now I think
it's<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.700> vector<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.300> vector<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.930> extended

it's the vector the vector with extended

this<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:53.800> my<00:02:53.890> new<00:02:53.920> favorite<00:02:54.400> SMG<00:02:54.820> is<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
this this is my new favorite SMG is the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.170 
this this is my new favorite SMG is the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
vector I think the the nerves have hit

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.110 
vector I think the the nerves have hit
the<00:02:58.300> MSM<00:02:58.690> seeing<00:02:58.960> the<00:02:59.080> PDW<00:02:59.620> way<00:02:59.770> too<00:02:59.830> hard<00:03:00.280> also

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
the MSM seeing the PDW way too hard also

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.820 
the MSM seeing the PDW way too hard also
I<00:03:01.150> noticed<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.050> patch<00:03:02.200> notes<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
I noticed in the patch notes that the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.250 
I noticed in the patch notes that the
type<00:03:03.220> 25<00:03:03.520> now<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.600> move<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.960> little<00:03:05.080> bit

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
type 25 now you move a little bit

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.510 
type 25 now you move a little bit
quicker<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:05.770> might<00:03:05.980> be<00:03:06.010> trying<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.430> give

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
quicker so I might be trying to give

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.240 
quicker so I might be trying to give
that<00:03:06.700> gunshot<00:03:07.120> as<00:03:07.330> well<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.650> they<00:03:09.040> made<00:03:09.220> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
that gunshot as well and they made it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.350 
that gunshot as well and they made it
medium-range<00:03:10.000> if<00:03:10.450> more<00:03:11.050> damage<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.000> type<00:03:13.000> 25

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
medium-range if more damage so type 25

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.080 
medium-range if more damage so type 25
might<00:03:13.690> become<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.960> new<00:03:14.140> popular<00:03:14.560> gun<00:03:14.740> in<00:03:15.730> public

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
might become a new popular gun in public

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.480 
might become a new popular gun in public
matches<00:03:16.240> for<00:03:16.600> me<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.680> competitive<00:03:18.250> play<00:03:18.370> you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.880 
matches for me and competitive play you
might<00:03:18.640> see<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.910> more<00:03:19.090> also<00:03:19.540> because<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.650> move

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
might see it more also because you move

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.160 
might see it more also because you move
faster<00:03:21.310> now<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.460> it<00:03:21.850> has<00:03:21.970> better<00:03:22.210> damage<00:03:22.840> for

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
faster now and it has better damage for

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.230 
faster now and it has better damage for
medium<00:03:23.500> range<00:03:23.710> so<00:03:24.490> you<00:03:24.550> might<00:03:24.760> see<00:03:24.940> some<00:03:25.150> of

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
medium range so you might see some of

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.660 
medium range so you might see some of
that<00:03:25.270> but<00:03:25.750> overall<00:03:26.500> my<00:03:26.770> thoughts<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.220> smg's

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
that but overall my thoughts on smg's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.260 
that but overall my thoughts on smg's

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
the time in this game it's really really

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.480 
the time in this game it's really really
hard<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.520> use<00:03:39.640> an<00:03:39.790> SMG<00:03:40.709> effectively<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.950> it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
hard to use an SMG effectively and it

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.090 
hard to use an SMG effectively and it
kind<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.730> sucks<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.240> my<00:03:44.050> personal<00:03:44.740> opinion

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
kind of sucks and my personal opinion

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.530 
kind of sucks and my personal opinion
the<00:03:45.190> SMGs<00:03:45.610> are<00:03:45.730> outclassed<00:03:46.090> by<00:03:46.180> assault

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
the SMGs are outclassed by assault

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.510 
the SMGs are outclassed by assault
rifles<00:03:46.900> up<00:03:47.020> close<00:03:47.260> now<00:03:47.290> because<00:03:48.130> they<00:03:48.310> also

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
rifles up close now because they also

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.550 
rifles up close now because they also
nerf<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.270> hip<00:03:49.390> fire<00:03:49.600> on<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> MSMC<00:03:50.320> in<00:03:50.470> the

nerf the the hip fire on the MSMC in the
PDW<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:52.950> well<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:53.980> don't<00:03:54.340> understand<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
PDW so like well I don't understand the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.730 
PDW so like well I don't understand the
the<00:03:55.300> hip<00:03:55.510> fire<00:03:55.720> nerfs<00:03:56.080> because<00:03:56.350> an<00:03:56.470> SMG

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
the hip fire nerfs because an SMG

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.020 
the hip fire nerfs because an SMG
supposed<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.190> be<00:03:57.250> good<00:03:57.400> up<00:03:57.520> close<00:03:57.550> and

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
supposed to be good up close and

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.670 
supposed to be good up close and
supposed<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.360> have<00:03:58.450> good<00:03:58.840> hipfire<00:03:59.290> but<00:03:59.500> what

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
supposed to have good hipfire but what

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.440 
supposed to have good hipfire but what
they<00:03:59.800> keep<00:03:59.980> doing<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.340> they<00:04:00.459> keep<00:04:00.670> they're

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
they keep doing is they keep they're

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
they keep doing is they keep they're
just<00:04:01.630> destroying<00:04:02.020> smg's<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.650> general<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.190> like

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
just destroying smg's in general so like

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.760 
just destroying smg's in general so like
I<00:04:03.640> think<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.420> assault<00:04:04.870> rifles<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.440> stick

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
I think that assault rifles can stick

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.550 
I think that assault rifles can stick
like<00:04:06.310> do<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:07.090> as<00:04:07.209> well<00:04:07.390> as<00:04:07.510> an<00:04:07.600> SMG<00:04:07.930> up<00:04:08.230> close

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
like do just as well as an SMG up close

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.560 
like do just as well as an SMG up close
they<00:04:09.130> destroy<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> medium<00:04:10.060> range<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.420> they

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
they destroy a medium range and they

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.960 
they destroy a medium range and they
definitely<00:04:11.320> destroy<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> long<00:04:11.920> range<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.430> I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
definitely destroy a long range and I

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.730 
definitely destroy a long range and I
think<00:04:13.240> this<00:04:13.630> game<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.020> gonna<00:04:14.140> be<00:04:14.230> switching

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
think this game is gonna be switching

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.349 
think this game is gonna be switching
youtubers<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.790> general<00:04:16.090> are<00:04:16.150> gonna<00:04:16.239> be

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
youtubers in general are gonna be

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.780 
youtubers in general are gonna be
switching<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.750> more<00:04:16.900> ARS<00:04:17.530> I'll<00:04:18.400> probably<00:04:18.580> be

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
switching to more ARS I'll probably be

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.280 
switching to more ARS I'll probably be
using<00:04:18.970> lightweight<00:04:19.359> hardline<00:04:20.020> with<00:04:20.169> an

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
using lightweight hardline with an

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.719 
using lightweight hardline with an
assault<00:04:20.650> rifle<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.100> just<00:04:21.250> absolutely<00:04:21.430> go

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
assault rifle and just absolutely go

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.490 
assault rifle and just absolutely go
into<00:04:21.880> town<00:04:22.060> because<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.450> think<00:04:22.510> think<00:04:23.229> assault

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
into town because I think think assault

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.570 
into town because I think think assault
rifles<00:04:23.800> are<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.979> best<00:04:24.160> guns

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
rifles are the best guns

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.679 
rifles are the best guns
