00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
dipped again which they'll do a quick

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.120

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
contaminants that could be on it so they

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
contaminants that could be on it so they
can<00:01:17.850> decode<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.140> put<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> nice

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
can decode it which will put a nice

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.060 
can decode it which will put a nice
black<00:01:19.860> film<00:01:20.250> over<00:01:20.610> everything<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:22.070> since
