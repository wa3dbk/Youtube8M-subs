00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.720 
algae that all that can have it smells
awful<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:15.080> chickens<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.159> fish<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:16.520> really

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
awful it's chickens and fish it's really

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.830

problems<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:20.000> can<00:01:20.210> be<00:01:20.300> fixed<00:01:20.570> through

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
problems and it can be fixed through

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.370 
problems and it can be fixed through
different<00:01:21.860> technologies<00:01:22.400> of<00:01:22.960> sonar<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.200> can

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
different technologies of sonar that can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.470 
different technologies of sonar that can
be<00:01:24.470> placed<00:01:24.680> under<00:01:24.920> water<00:01:25.100> though<00:01:25.700> these

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
be placed under water though these

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600 
be placed under water though these
sonars<00:01:26.900> are<00:01:27.020> expensive<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.620> my<00:01:28.220> goal<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.460> to

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
sonars are expensive and my goal is to

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.150 
sonars are expensive and my goal is to
take<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.510> majority<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.930> money<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.140> make<00:01:30.380> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.000 
take the majority the money I make and
put<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.520> towards<00:01:31.820> these<00:01:32.420> seminars<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.080> take

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
put it towards these seminars that take

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.490 
put it towards these seminars that take
away<00:01:34.160> this<00:01:34.340> bad<00:01:34.790> white<00:01:35.000> algae<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.290> rest

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
away this bad white algae and the rest

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.020 
away this bad white algae and the rest
of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.620> money<00:01:36.770> out<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:36.920> usually<00:01:37.160> will<00:01:37.550> put

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
know Bassmaster he gave me the idea of

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.440 
know Bassmaster he gave me the idea of
doing<00:03:05.220> deadly<00:03:06.220> seven<00:03:06.550> seven<00:03:06.820> inch<00:03:06.940> worms<00:03:07.180> I

doing deadly seven seven inch worms I

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.850 
doing deadly seven seven inch worms I
thought<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.780> was<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.960> great<00:03:08.080> idea

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
thought that was a great idea

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.910 
thought that was a great idea
kind<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.340> making<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.780> baits<00:03:10.780> three<00:03:11.650> different

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
kind of making the baits three different

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
kind of making the baits three different
types<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.340> red<00:03:13.000> kind<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.660> like<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.810> blood<00:03:14.050> red<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
types of red kind of like a blood red a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.520 
types of red kind of like a blood red a
thick<00:03:15.130> got<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.790> cloudy<00:03:16.090> red<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.720> know<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.110> think

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
thick got a cloudy red you know I think

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.630 
thick got a cloudy red you know I think
that's<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.710> really<00:03:17.800> good<00:03:17.920> idea<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.370> thanks

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
that's a really good idea in thanks
