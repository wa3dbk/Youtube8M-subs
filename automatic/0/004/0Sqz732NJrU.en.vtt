so on board on the app we have for step
of<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> free<00:02:16.480> boundary<00:02:16.810> cube<00:02:17.140> which<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.350> quite

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
of a free boundary cube which is quite

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.059 
of a free boundary cube which is quite
standard<00:02:17.950> being<00:02:18.819> bass<00:02:19.240> middle<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.780> treble

they<00:02:21.069> all<00:02:21.220> work<00:02:21.370> pretty<00:02:21.550> well<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:22.270> make

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
they all work pretty well they make

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
they all work pretty well they make
different<00:02:22.630> sounds<00:02:23.050> there<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.100> good<00:02:24.280> times<00:02:24.490> in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
different sounds there is good times in

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.780 
different sounds there is good times in
that<00:02:24.819> you<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.390> got<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.630> find<00:02:25.810> them<00:02:26.790> it's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that you just got to find them it's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
that you just got to find them it's
pretty<00:02:27.970> good<00:02:28.209> it's<00:02:28.870> very<00:02:28.930> responsive<00:02:29.380> as<00:02:29.740> well

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
pretty good it's very responsive as well

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160 
pretty good it's very responsive as well
which<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.310> quite<00:02:30.490> nice

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
which is quite nice

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.350 
which is quite nice
next<00:02:32.860> being<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.400> essentially<00:02:33.820> have<00:02:34.030> free

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
next being you essentially have free

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.540 
next being you essentially have free
volumes<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.140> sound<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:36.220> quite

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
volumes with the sound it's quite

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.610 
volumes with the sound it's quite
exciting<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.209> tricky<00:02:37.450> at<00:02:37.630> first<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:38.110> it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
exciting and tricky at first but it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.890 
exciting and tricky at first but it's
amazing<00:02:39.070> once<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.340> get<00:02:39.489> used<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.660> free

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900

you<00:04:42.830> also<00:04:42.950> have<00:04:43.100> an<00:04:43.220> effects<00:04:43.520> loop<00:04:43.930> with<00:04:44.930> send

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
you also have an effects loop with send

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.290 
you also have an effects loop with send
on<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.410> tongue<00:04:45.650> which<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.580> useful<00:04:46.760> if<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.120> put

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
on the tongue which is useful if you put

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.010 
on the tongue which is useful if you put
delay<00:04:47.540> pedals<00:04:47.960> reverbs<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:49.780> guess<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.900> could

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
delay pedals reverbs I guess you could

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.690 
delay pedals reverbs I guess you could
put<00:04:51.050> modulations<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:51.890> nephew<00:04:52.250> wanted<00:04:52.520> to

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
put modulations and nephew wanted to

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.480 
put modulations and nephew wanted to
it's<00:04:53.170> they're<00:04:54.170> good<00:04:54.380> because<00:04:54.800> they<00:04:55.040> keep<00:04:55.250> out

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
it's they're good because they keep out

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.910 
it's they're good because they keep out
of<00:04:55.670> your<00:04:55.820> signal<00:04:56.300> chamber<00:04:56.690> pedals<00:04:57.170> for

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
of your signal chamber pedals for

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.120 
of your signal chamber pedals for
instance<00:04:59.320> you<00:05:00.320> don't<00:05:00.530> really<00:05:00.710> want<00:05:00.980> them<00:05:01.040> to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
instance you don't really want them to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.480 
instance you don't really want them to
be<00:05:01.250> around<00:05:01.490> distortion<00:05:02.090> pedals<00:05:02.410> because<00:05:03.490> then

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
be around distortion pedals because then

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.830 
be around distortion pedals because then
you<00:05:04.610> start<00:05:04.670> the<00:05:04.970> store<00:05:05.210> in<00:05:05.360> reverb<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:08.240> can

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
you start the store in reverb and it can

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.720 
you start the store in reverb and it can
be<00:05:08.960> dirty<00:05:09.230> as<00:05:09.470> well<00:05:09.890> some<00:05:10.130> people<00:05:10.250> like<00:05:10.400> that

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
be dirty as well some people like that

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.580 
be dirty as well some people like that
sound<00:05:11.030> quite<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.780> few<00:05:11.960> people<00:05:12.260> like<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.500> have

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
sound quite a few people like to have

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.260 
sound quite a few people like to have
more<00:05:12.800> pure<00:05:13.070> sound<00:05:13.400> for<00:05:13.669> they<00:05:13.760> go<00:05:13.940> for<00:05:14.180> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
more pure sound for they go for the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:38.709 
more pure sound for they go for the
effects

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.659 

it<00:05:39.719> also<00:05:39.870> has<00:05:40.169> a<00:05:40.199> high<00:05:40.680> gain<00:05:40.949> output<00:05:41.370> input

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
it also has a high gain output input

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.570 
it also has a high gain output input
sorry<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.509> a<00:05:42.810> low<00:05:42.990> gain<00:05:43.169> input<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:44.340> high<00:05:44.520> gain

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
sorry and a low gain input the high gain

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.850 
sorry and a low gain input the high gain
input<00:05:44.879> is<00:05:45.150> useful<00:05:45.539> because<00:05:45.689> it's<00:05:46.080> it's<00:05:46.650> more

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
input is useful because it's it's more

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.540 
input is useful because it's it's more
sensitive<00:05:47.129> and<00:05:48.110> it's<00:05:49.110> useful<00:05:49.620> for<00:05:49.650> lower

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
sensitive and it's useful for lower

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.730 
sensitive and it's useful for lower
output<00:05:50.819> instruments<00:05:51.810> or<00:05:52.289> if<00:05:52.439> you've<00:05:52.590> got

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
output instruments or if you've got

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.980 
output instruments or if you've got
pickups<00:05:53.099> at<00:05:53.280> a<00:05:53.310> lower<00:05:53.580> output<00:05:53.750> then<00:05:54.750> say

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
pickups at a lower output then say

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.890 
pickups at a lower output then say
something<00:05:55.379> like<00:05:55.500> an<00:05:55.650> EMG<00:05:56.449> it<00:05:57.449> will<00:05:57.569> pick<00:05:57.719> it<00:05:57.750> up

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
something like an EMG it will pick it up

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.570 
something like an EMG it will pick it up
more<00:05:58.110> nicely<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:58.740> get<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:58.979> clarity<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.460> the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
more nicely and get the clarity in the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.360 
more nicely and get the clarity in the
whole<00:05:59.729> character<00:06:00.000> of<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.889> so<00:06:01.889> when<00:06:02.039> I<00:06:02.069> first

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
whole character of it so when I first

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.619 
whole character of it so when I first
started<00:06:02.669> playing<00:06:02.759> this<00:06:02.939> amp<00:06:03.180> when<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.389> first

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
started playing this amp when I first

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.830 
started playing this amp when I first
got<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:03.990> it<00:06:04.710> literally<00:06:05.639> screamed<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.449> me<00:06:06.599> that

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
got it it literally screamed to me that

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.749 
got it it literally screamed to me that
it's<00:06:06.990> a<00:06:07.050> blues<00:06:07.319> amp<00:06:07.530> it's<00:06:07.919> a<00:06:08.039> blues<00:06:08.280> man<00:06:08.460> down

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
it's a blues amp it's a blues man down

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.300 
it's a blues amp it's a blues man down
but<00:06:09.539> just<00:06:10.139> once<00:06:10.379> a<00:06:10.469> number<00:06:10.740> just<00:06:10.919> does<00:06:11.129> the<00:06:11.279> job

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
but just once a number just does the job

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.790 
but just once a number just does the job
gets<00:06:12.210> a<00:06:12.300> bit<00:06:12.449> of<00:06:12.539> crunch<00:06:12.779> and<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.110> can<00:06:13.620> just

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
gets a bit of crunch and you can just

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.769 
gets a bit of crunch and you can just
front<00:06:14.069> with<00:06:14.219> pedals<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:14.849> it's<00:06:15.330> exactly<00:06:15.569> what

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779 
front with pedals and it's exactly what

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.110 
front with pedals and it's exactly what
it<00:06:16.020> does<00:06:16.139> it<00:06:16.860> takes<00:06:17.069> pedals<00:06:17.430> so<00:06:17.580> well<00:06:17.849> I've

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
it does it takes pedals so well I've

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.939 
it does it takes pedals so well I've
used<00:06:18.330> it<00:06:18.479> for<00:06:18.629> everything<00:06:18.719> whether<00:06:19.680> it<00:06:19.860> be

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
used it for everything whether it be

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.290 
used it for everything whether it be
clean<00:06:20.219> tones<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.819> then<00:06:20.909> use<00:06:21.029> mind

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
clean tones and then use mind

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.570 
clean tones and then use mind
distortions<00:06:21.990> reusing<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:22.949> distortions<00:06:23.430> on

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
distortions reusing the distortions on
