00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 i 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.720
 if you want the school to be just one 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.090
 where you are going to perfect 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.400
 skills how to send messages without seeing 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.500
 the screen sleep without being discovered and 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.660
 do team exams then let me 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.279
 tell you that you are right is not 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.990
 some study a lot but sometimes the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.949
 things that they teach you are not at all 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.289
 correct 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.289
 welcome to coco but these are 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.750
 and then it 's blue because it reflects the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.850
 sky many believe that blue water is 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.620
 equal to reflected blue sky but the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.960
 reality is that water molecules 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.210
 they absorb more the color frequency 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
 red making it really blue 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.320
 but this is almost imperceptible in 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.360
 small quantities you have to see meters and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.370
 meters of water to realize the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.140
 reflection of the sky is influenced but only 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 when the surface of the water is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.739
 calm or when the see at an angle of 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.960
 10 degrees 4 electricity travels the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.210
 speed of light 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.369
 in your school books safe says 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.070
 that the electrons travel in the cables 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.050
 to almost completely at the speed of 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.570
 the light the reality is that what travels 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.880
 very fast is the electric power and still 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.009
 well it is not even close to the speed of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.140
 the light that would violate the theory of 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.390
 relativity and it would make einstein angry 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.060
 the electrons that occupy a place in the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.009
 space they have mass are formed 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.720
 as if they were waiting in line 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.090
 of the tortillas and when someone leaves 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.159
 this space travels quickly to the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.610
 end of the line according to the people 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.440
 they are moving forward is something similar 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.920
 all the people believed that the earth 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.870
 it was flat before crist贸bal color all 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 We know the story 'Christopher Columbus' 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.530
 I said to everyone I know that the earth is 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.570
 spherical have to believe me our crazy 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.820
 and normal people said do not pay attention 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.890
 to crist贸bal or with the earth is flat and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.900
 if they are far away they will fall to me 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.880
 the thing before you leave breeding the truth is 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.979
 that at that time many people knew that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.229
 the earth was mostly spherical 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.940
 sailors and explorers but the lawsuit 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 with crist贸bal col贸n was on the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.869
 distance to get to india by the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.090
 another side like colom was not so 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.740
 smart we would have died 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.630
 before arriving in india but already 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.580
 We know the story luckily 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.070
 he found a small place called 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.750
 new world or america at least it 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.870
 he dared if he was not not talking about him 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870
 now 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.530
 there is a dark side of the moon the orbit 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.840
 of the moon is synchronous this means 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.880
 It takes the same time to rotate in your 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 axis that to give a return to the earth in 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.989
 its orbit this makes it have a side 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 that does not show us we never ever 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.440
 aims with the same hemisphere but 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.569
 when the moon is between the sun and the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.730
 earth you could say it 's daytime in 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.470
 the hidden side and it's night on the side 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 that we see as long as the moon is 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.610
 behind the earth it is night in the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.500
 Hidden side and day on the side that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.540
 we all know so it's the side 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.850
 dark you have to have a lot of light sometimes 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.620
 as for the rabbit on the moon that yes 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.620
 It exists and sometimes it goes down to visit us 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.810
 a new 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.730
 the Chinese wall is the only structure 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.240
 made by man that can be seen 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.950
 from space if by chance you 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.990
 you find orbiting very low in the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.610
 clear space that you can see the wall 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.800
 Chinese we have Google Earths for 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.810
 confirm it but if you realize it from 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.510
 there you can also see many other 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.120
 things like bridges boats messages 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.870
 extraterrestrial cities and the butt of 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.569
 nicki minaj 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.730
 the apollo astronauts destroyed your 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.739
 childhood by declaring that from the moon 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.599
 my mother does not see anything done by him 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.340
 man but there's something interesting is 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.810
 can observe a living being from the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450
 space the great barrier reef 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.489
 Australian is the largest reef in 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.709
 coral of the world can be seen from very 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.510
 away and it is said to be the living being more 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.579
 big although in reality it's only the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.129
 accumulation of colonies skeletons 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.250
 corals for thousands of years thank you 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.170
 by watching this video if you're ready or 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.180
 ready to make a fool of your 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.340
 teachers do not forget to subscribe give 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.200
 thumb up and leave a comment but 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.299
 above all, share this video in all 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.890
 sides so that each time we are more coconut 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.890
 coconut tree 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.550
 you almost realize from there it 's also
