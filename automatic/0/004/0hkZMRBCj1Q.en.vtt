00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so but that's something you might want

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.750 
so but that's something you might want
to<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.510> know<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.650> light<00:01:35.010> like<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.580> do

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
to you know if you have light like we do

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.280 
to you know if you have light like we do
an<00:01:36.030> issue<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:37.040> space<00:01:38.040> lack<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.880> space<00:01:39.290> filled

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
an issue with space lack of space filled

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.289 
an issue with space lack of space filled
up<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.540> over<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> good<00:01:44.790> trick<00:01:45.470> so

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
up and over and this is a good trick so

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.649 
up and over and this is a good trick so
right<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.330> we<00:01:48.510> only<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.170> rod<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.560> reel

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
right now we only have one rod and reel

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.219 
right now we only have one rod and reel
eventually<00:01:51.659> we're<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> get

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
eventually we're going to have to get

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.490 
eventually we're going to have to get
another<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.100> both<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> fish

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
another one because we both want to fish

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.859 
another one because we both want to fish
and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.920> still<00:01:56.310> haven't<00:01:56.729> gone<00:01:57.090> down<00:01:57.150> there<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and I still haven't gone down there to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
and I still haven't gone down there to
the<00:01:57.900> fishing<00:01:58.380> hole<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.830> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> fish<00:01:59.280> at

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the fishing hole that I want to fish at

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.050 
the fishing hole that I want to fish at
it's<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.840> other<00:02:01.170> side<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.590> me<00:02:02.280> its<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.759> down

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it's the other side of me its way down

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's the other side of me its way down
there<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> has<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> walk<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:04.920> mile<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
there but it has to walk like mile and a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.229 
there but it has to walk like mile and a
half<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.210> um<00:02:07.080> anyway<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:11.029> had<00:02:12.029> just

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
half I think um anyway so I had just

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.300 
half I think um anyway so I had just
thought<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.689> something<00:02:13.109> else<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.560> wanted<00:02:13.919> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.910 

mmm<00:02:18.980> anyway<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.239> i<00:02:21.239> hope<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.379> like<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.769> idea

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
mmm anyway so i hope you like the idea

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.660 
mmm anyway so i hope you like the idea
it's<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.730> nice<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.299> trick<00:02:25.040> now<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.430> have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it's a nice little trick now if you have

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.479 
it's a nice little trick now if you have
a<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:28.579> rod<00:02:29.579> that's<00:02:29.969> like<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> heavy-duty

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
a a rod that's like like a heavy-duty

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.179 
a a rod that's like like a heavy-duty
saltwater<00:02:33.209> odd<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.900> don't<00:02:34.319> think<00:02:34.409> it'll<00:02:34.829> fit<00:02:35.129> in

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
saltwater odd I don't think it'll fit in

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.039 
saltwater odd I don't think it'll fit in
there<00:02:35.519> but<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.329> stick<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.689> right<00:02:36.719> there

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
there but you just stick it right there

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.069 
there but you just stick it right there
in<00:02:37.170> all<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.489> know<00:02:38.549> this<00:02:39.389> is<00:02:39.599> against<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
in all and you know this is against the

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.440 
in all and you know this is against the
wall<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.189> you<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.579> put<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.909> in<00:02:42.000> there<00:02:42.060> like

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
wall and you just put it in there like

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.750 
wall and you just put it in there like
that<00:02:42.689> so<00:02:43.879> this<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.420> little<00:02:45.750> nail<00:02:46.200> from

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
that so this is just a little nail from

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.559 
that so this is just a little nail from
like<00:02:47.760> you'd<00:02:48.120> put<00:02:48.389> up<00:02:48.650> with<00:02:49.650> picture<00:02:50.159> hangers

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.030 

unless<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.870> didn't<00:02:55.230> come<00:02:55.379> from<00:02:55.439> this<00:02:55.739> box

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
unless this didn't come from this box

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.190 
unless this didn't come from this box
