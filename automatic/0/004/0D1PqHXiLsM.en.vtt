00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello along with this video tutorial 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.710
 i want to show you how to cross 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.769
 the bams help and flaps one 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 Simple motor sailer on the spectrum 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.630
 the sexy channel is setting up something now 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.960
 First of all we want to reach the cross 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.880
 or should as a superscript brake 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 be configured 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 Secondly, the braking aids should be over 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.119
 The throttle stick is infinitely adjustable 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 his 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.430
 Third, the gas should be greedy 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 old ones are laid and fourthly the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.840
 ailerons are supposed to move around during the thermal flight 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.640
 put down a few millimeters 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.320
 can be 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 so that this can be achieved is a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.329
 receiver with at least five channels 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.969
 Need to use in my example 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.270
 I have a spectrum as a 600 receiver 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.079
 built into my place motor glider 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.649
 by st model this model has a v 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.090
 the tail and ailerons must first 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.339
 we the servus other receivers 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.780
 connect 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.680
 Here is a picture of the receiver 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 Connections as I have made them 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.060
 in my blaze seeger I close 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.390
 First, the two servus of the v Leitwerk 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.110
 to a server I connect to the lwv 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.080
 channel 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.189
 this is the elevator and one to the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.790
 rhader channel 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.009
 this is the rudder to the gas 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.369
 on the looked on and off 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.979
 The cruiser needs to be 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.189
 connected to the receiver's channel 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.020
 but this is the one to watch out for 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.360
 connecting the transmitter to the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.399
 make absolutely sure that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 the greedy car on the zero position 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 now stands to the rudder so that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.759
 Ailerons from brake help to work 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.740
 every rudder must be able to servo 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.189
 connected to a receiver channel 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.439
 become 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.820
 which thus excludes the use of a 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.939
 y cable for the transverse or from a 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.670
 Quite well, then finally to the 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:13.510
 channel the other to the x1 can 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.650
 Mainz receiver should be the channel model 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.920
 stays on my mom 600 teachers come 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.420
 we now to setup the transmitter first 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.880
 must in winkl mix the option duo celeron 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.870
 and for my v leitwerk the option like 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.300
 be put on active 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.880
 with the dual option all activated 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.190
 Now the sender knows that every one is transversely or 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.110
 controlled by its own channel 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.550
 becomes 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.920
 Now you want to use the ailerons 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.840
 It is enough to use the flap switch 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.959
 corresponding settings in the flax 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 june to make the cross of the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.340
 However, help out of the country by means of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.989
 can operate continuously 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.489
 must and mix 1 quarter on flap 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.980
 become 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.890
 beware, the silver path never reaches 100 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.299
 put the otherwise not gone more for the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.030
 transverse or control remains at 80-85 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.840
 percent will be enough left off 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.670
 to control with the kids 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.079
 Now I put in the mini flops the rudder 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.209
 for the thermal flight on land 15 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.280
 this puts the cross or the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.650
 activate the meat maker by some 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.040
 millimeters down 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.690
 and so it would look at the model from the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.109
 first the normal control of the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.109
 Move 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.440
 Now the Koreans are full of gas 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.720
 in the basic position when drawing 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.030
 The gas field will now be the source of the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:04:01.090
 infinitely positioned and thus serve as 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:03.280
 limit help is the throttle all the way 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.990
 At the back are the source roof to 80 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.170
 percent extended to the top 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.110
 the pressing of the body shows that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.090
 still enough time to practice plays and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.090
 to be entitled to the enemy with the children 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.830
 also lowering the ailerons 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:30.820
 for the thermic airfield switch 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:33.840
 that worked it was already one 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.840
 good flight richer everything
