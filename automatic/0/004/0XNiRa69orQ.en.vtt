worry about those those just hold the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.449 
worry about those those just hold the
board<00:04:19.229> into<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.590> case<00:04:19.859> they<00:04:20.130> don't<00:04:20.280> need<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
board into the case they don't need to

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.700 
board into the case they don't need to
be<00:04:20.549> an<00:04:20.640> unscrew<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.600> just<00:04:21.780> end<00:04:21.930> screw<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.320> so

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
be an unscrew but just end screw the so

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.260 
be an unscrew but just end screw the so
you<00:04:22.800> get<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.070> top<00:04:23.460> case<00:04:23.789> out

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
you get this top case out

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.960 
you get this top case out
so<00:04:25.900> once<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.289> get<00:04:26.680> all<00:04:26.860> those<00:04:27.009> those<00:04:27.639> five

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
so once you get all those those five

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.950 
so once you get all those those five
screws<00:04:28.270> done<00:04:29.190> flip<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.280> back<00:04:30.430> over<00:04:30.960> and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
screws done flip the back over and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.740 
screws done flip the back over and
you're<00:04:32.110> gonna<00:04:32.169> want<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:33.090> say<00:04:34.090> thank<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.599> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you're gonna want to say thank you a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.939 
you're gonna want to say thank you a
better<00:04:34.990> angle<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.840> want<00:04:41.050> them<00:04:41.169> just<00:04:41.319> lift

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
better angle and want them just lift

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.189 
better angle and want them just lift
lightly<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:44.530> like<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:46.330> lift<00:04:46.509> up<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.050> it

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
lightly just like that to lift up and it

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.809 
lightly just like that to lift up and it
should<00:04:47.410> come<00:04:47.590> undone<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.190> then<00:04:48.280> just<00:04:48.490> slide

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
should come undone and then just slide

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.909 
should come undone and then just slide
because<00:04:49.479> it<00:04:49.690> has<00:04:49.810> those<00:04:49.990> hooks<00:04:50.319> in<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.650> bottom

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
because it has those hooks in the bottom

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.080 
because it has those hooks in the bottom
and<00:04:51.849> just<00:04:52.210> sliding<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:54.009> the<00:04:54.639> top<00:04:54.880> is

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
and just sliding and that is the top is

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.629 
and just sliding and that is the top is
off<00:04:55.240> simple<00:04:55.840> as<00:04:55.960> that

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639

two three four five all black screws it
shouldn't<00:05:35.169> really<00:05:35.259> matter<00:05:35.500> though<00:05:35.800> they

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
shouldn't really matter though they

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.730 
shouldn't really matter though they
don't<00:05:36.340> differ<00:05:36.580> in<00:05:36.789> size<00:05:37.000> from<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.539> metal<00:05:38.530> case

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
don't differ in size from the metal case

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.129 
don't differ in size from the metal case
ones<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:39.909> that<00:05:40.180> can<00:05:40.300> mix<00:05:40.509> and<00:05:40.630> match<00:05:40.690> it<00:05:40.990> don't

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
ones so that can mix and match it don't

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.399 
ones so that can mix and match it don't
matter

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
matter

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.499

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.390 

the<00:05:55.569> thing<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:55.990> with<00:05:56.199> electronics<00:05:56.860> is<00:05:57.419> that

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
the thing is with electronics is that

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.740 
the thing is with electronics is that
everybody<00:06:00.400> thinks<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.610> that<00:06:01.150> complicated

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
everybody thinks that that complicated

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.499 
everybody thinks that that complicated
and<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.849> fragile<00:06:03.849> but<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.210> truth<00:06:04.419> is

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
and that fragile but the truth is

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.170 
and that fragile but the truth is
they're<00:06:04.750> not<00:06:05.009> I'm<00:06:06.009> surprised<00:06:06.520> my<00:06:06.669> ps3<00:06:06.940> still

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.129 
apart I'm surprised the blu-rays rash
still<00:06:13.120> works<00:06:13.300> in<00:06:13.449> many<00:06:13.599> times<00:06:13.780> as<00:06:13.870> I've<00:06:13.960> spoken

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
still works in many times as I've spoken

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.680 
still works in many times as I've spoken
of<00:06:14.289> art<00:06:14.500> and<00:06:14.740> done<00:06:15.340> videos<00:06:15.639> and<00:06:16.000> stuff<00:06:16.539> like

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
of art and done videos and stuff like

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.899 
of art and done videos and stuff like
that<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.370> researched<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:18.580> looked<00:06:18.669> around

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
that and researched and looked around

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.649 
that and researched and looked around
but<00:06:19.710> um<00:06:20.849> this<00:06:21.849> is<00:06:22.030> probably<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.509> most

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
but um this is probably the most

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.950 
but um this is probably the most
dangerous<00:06:23.319> part<00:06:23.680> of<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:25.870> whole<00:06:26.050> procedure<00:06:26.440> is

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
dangerous part of the whole procedure is

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.320 
dangerous part of the whole procedure is
when<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.110> take<00:06:30.039> the<00:06:30.219> cover<00:06:30.430> off<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:30.729> get<00:06:31.150> to

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
when you take the cover off and get to

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.019 
when you take the cover off and get to
the<00:06:31.449> laser<00:06:31.659> and<00:06:31.930> it's<00:06:32.080> exposed<00:06:32.500> to<00:06:32.680> everything

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
the laser and it's exposed to everything

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.769 
the laser and it's exposed to everything
so<00:06:34.229> once<00:06:35.229> you've<00:06:35.349> done<00:06:35.500> all<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:35.770> screws<00:06:36.779> the

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779 
so once you've done all the screws the

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:38.670 
so once you've done all the screws the
lid

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
lid

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.580 
lid
is<00:06:38.740> gonna<00:06:39.009> be<00:06:39.220> loose<00:06:40.030> just<00:06:40.449> like<00:06:40.630> that<00:06:40.780> but<00:06:41.440> um

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
is gonna be loose just like that but um

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.159 
is gonna be loose just like that but um
there's<00:06:41.889> gonna<00:06:41.979> be<00:06:42.100> a<00:06:42.220> screw<00:06:42.550> here<00:06:43.060> I<00:06:43.240> lost

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169
