00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 the a is yours is with you 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
 I 'm rodrigo and I'm doing this 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.460
 video here exclusively to respond 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 to the question that arises what else is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.730
 made in the same youtube videos many 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.160
 videos about android that is how I 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 I write the gameplay of androids 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 without a camera filming the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.650
 cell phone out of screening is good 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.140
 so you shorter is to be more practical 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 there are two personal forms of you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.600
 manage to write to the Androni play 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.480
 first one is by software and there are 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.270
 different softwares on google play than 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.520
 allow you to capture the screen in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 some cases of sound also coming out of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 cell phone 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 you can search for example by 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.449
 names like screen and tightrope was 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 so I will not name it here 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.539
 because simply because I do not have 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 experience with such programs is not 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.850
 Difficult to recommend if neither I have 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.220
 experience but speaks that there are 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.740
 feeding of this technique is what this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.740
 consume many phone features and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.330
 ends up that often gets bad maybe 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.549
 most of the time it gets bad 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 mainly because many people 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.820
 use android phones that do not have much 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 resource ne 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 imagine that with Galaxy y Cell 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.509
 teach you that you will not be able to do 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 capture until you play at the same time already 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.650
 I've seen people using up 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.650
 powerful phones like galaxies 3 or s2 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.659
 and slow capture with software by 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 cause of this then this is the first 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.590
 possibility but I recommend only for 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.079
 make lighter recordings with 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
 applications and things like that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.420
 the second clear possibility is to use 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 a capture card for example is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 cat game capture or even red and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.140
 mpb 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.700
 there the cat is no one's capture is more 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 natural to capture because 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 annually android phones they do 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 hdmi video output is the case of the galaxy 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.579
 nexus here 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.170
 he has the possibility to make the group 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.330
 has hdmi ie ​​i play an hdmi signal 1 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.360
 is the game cat wants for example and how 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.130
 it already has this hdmi interface 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 send it to the computer or the same 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.530
 way capture hdmi video game it 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.260
 captured it is a possibility in 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.210
 relation to red he wants from hd 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 she actually has the option of capturing 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.650
 component but I already made a video here 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.330
 on the channel where I showed how 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.270
 makes to capture hdmi 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.040
 In this case, the vdm of this android 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.380
 she then I'll put a link there yes 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.430
 for you to access this video in 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.840
 that I showed how I did the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.850
 Android capture on it and I think 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.820
 will be thus will serve for one person 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.170
 to leave feeding this technique is clear 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.550
 that you have to buy 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.300
 capture that is usually a device 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.130
 expensive is not cheap and the second here is yours 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.200
 android salon have to do another because 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.700
 hdmi and I know this is what makes and what 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.700
 several others do 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.310
 there are several galaxy who make the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.780
 sony and some motorola at last but the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.820
 seixal homes simpler for example 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.770
 do not do this is so I could not 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.780
 can make direct screen recording 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.970
 with the capture card the information is 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 basically there are two ways to 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.350
 first by software that has the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.040
 to slow down the recording 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.510
 and the second by capture board that has 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.280
 As a negative point fact you have to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.989
 buy a package of height that is expensive and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.280
 this is the android have to do an act 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.180
 public at the gym 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.880
 that's what I hope it helps remedied 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.530
 of you and you liked the video 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.370
 It seems like I liked that it did not help 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.110
 divulge it 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.090
 This is the first one watching my channel. 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.830
 open sign up and will follow the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.600
 next events here on youtube 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.100
 I'm going to stay here and let 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.100
 you spoke
