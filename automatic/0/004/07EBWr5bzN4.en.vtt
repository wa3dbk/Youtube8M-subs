 larks 1 blue because I do not like it at all - I see what happens in France 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 the reminder that you are supposed to monitor the device 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.070
 very precious 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.070
 this is going to hold finally I hope 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.500
 you see it's repaired 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.350
 we are at home because 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 you can ask to stand in front of the screen for bettors 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 little by little we did not know where he was 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 arrayet not yet arrived that's it 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.970
 but in any case what I can tell you is that it is adopted the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.729
 right question to their contents he should already be where he stood 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.590
 spent something 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 what could have happened to them 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.500
 if we said 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 for brice and all the more overwhelming important 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.280
 the hamas has been shifted to the radius 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.070
 you know ali chebah that before 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.810
 they are quite capable of retracting and sheltering 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.630
 to not receive a rain of asteroids on the head 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.130
 so at home 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.439

 the stop-court allowed to keep his gift 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.900
 it may well be that he decided to make a detour but he 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.350
 will come 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.460
 so we depended for a little 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 do not even welcome it with such sad faces 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 yet more difficult to support the surprise 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.789
 you will smile 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.979
 vincent lemieux 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.939

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.109

 we are caught 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.879
 as for 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.879
 nobody is perfect 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.029
 resignation 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.359
 will 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.569
 collection 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.539
 finally the planets young who knows 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.539
 in short 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.219
 the imperial guard 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.959
 I think you want to check my identity 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.330
 I am not of service 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.409
 I came to watch the other stores a year for Japan 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.429
 look good you could everywhere I hope you'll like it 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.619
 but here just about everything that can interest the year of the sea 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.619
 red 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.949
 this type of object is a marvel 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.919
 table 1 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.079
 it is unworthy of the circuit the aquarium 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.079
 admit it's not common 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.169
 she was carrying to the ball 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.429
 and it only requires very little water I hate this optics 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.079
 the album did the same thing we drink a glass from time to time 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.369
 I wanted to give you an idea of ​​the species of stupidity and tools can 

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:22.550
 request 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.509
 troops m 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.979
 this is an extraordinary device that is apt 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.400
 it's normally on the video here 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.900
 Seraph 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.979
 the recipients 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.710
 I know 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.680
 guru is to know which day I had gas deliveries via sending in your 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.110
 white house but it should not talk much anymore now you can 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.629
 to believe me 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.119
 it was made especially by israel and the hamas to have made 18 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.520
 dead it's a painstaking job 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.219
 to do embroidery in the sahara m 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.909
 so let's wait 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.520
 I know you're used to waiting 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.520
 so be patient 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.099
 to the efficient program 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.159
 it is a fact 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.330
 andré mercier I will bring you later if you attack energy 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 clean for peace 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.449
 it does not please you it is very practical 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.020
 this is just a brush 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.210
 it's just a purse a brush 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.210
 it's just a repetition 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.800
 it's more than that 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800
 obviously we did not have the instructions on the warranty 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.430
 although this device is a growth off it was not on the 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.350
 clothes of the faces and all the rest he had tried in vain to make himself the 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.650
 nails clean eyes nobody and thunderstorms 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.990
 what were the motivations of the nervous system 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.690
 being said one can quote the code the period much more clearly as the 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.530
 the lawyer claims 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.530
 half less time for him to divest 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.889
 I do not know how to do cheap things 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.889
 Besides, I have been using for a long time 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.289
 we have every day it's true 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.800
 but very often 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.980
 strong another advantage of this real small wonder you can 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.139
 recharge by plugging five minutes on a small lasar plain ordinary these 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.279
 practices I take it 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.089
 congratulations and you are doing well 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.240
 then you desire and it is simply 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.240
 give us something in exchange eddie hicks i take it 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.240
 I must admit that it takes away a weight 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.830
 I was afraid of embarrassing you by asking you to accept a gift 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.039
 the ump embarrassed people 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.360
 do not you embarrass people it's true but I'm doing 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.589
 how best works 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:40.589
 I already said that 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.529
 for jean-marie beney 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.610
 we established a dam and we ordered the curfew 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.750
 finally we started the operation it's only a matter of time 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.409
 but we find the rebels 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.649
 red-ball jobs on the belgium recovery project I've never had any 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:01.539
 beautiful things to their righteous
