00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.750
 that were processed 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.350
 but how the street is designed it seemed the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 unhappy 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 I say that it is prettier or it has 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.319

 [Music] 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.820
 but equal 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
 for me 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.780
 to pass this shield you must know is that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.310
 in this the part is the thermal plant 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.280
 the product that disarm it by the channel 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.280
 with this the manual 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.280
 installation 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:48.670

 we had that but because I wanted a shot 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.230
 of the ticket from above you have to lose 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.230
