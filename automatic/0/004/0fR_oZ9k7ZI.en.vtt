 the ruins elsewhere behind me I 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.940
 feel my homework and take a quick shot 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.500
 on the images of the concert of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510

 she opened the scene of this Saturday 7 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.299

 blues a huge seine so for you 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.880
 obviously it's not necessarily a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.170
 exercise that is most unusual 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.509
 what does she have of particular for 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.049
 you this jenny scene of the dwelling 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.350
 particular murat that she is at home at 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.700
 the slow rega that all my family 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.700
 maternal jeanne marie gallant I 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.689
 huge memories here so y'a 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.500
 nothing laser a bit of emotion a lot 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.479
 of emotion returning to this scene and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100
 especially having the honor to do 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.899
 the opening of the festival is 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.049
 particularly symbolic for me in 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.049
 any case 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.840
 the new 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.950
 I understand and scrape with 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.280
 ears lying around that you had a 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.470
 gene 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.420
 you talked about a bit of a small 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.430
 dust then suddenly you found the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 force that's it the show must go round 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.350
 was because coming in there is a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.090
 dust in the throat and that's what 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.040
 moment that I have water finally we 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.959
 steward told me good brief go on 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.500
 scene so had to manage I drank water 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 etc. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.760
 but actually during the four 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.920
 first titles 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 well annoyed then the stage manager goes from 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.909
 anyway trigger a lawsuit against 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.030
 all possible sand storms 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.030
 and imaginable 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.220
 what really changed on dante genius 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.570
 when you look at yourself, you see 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.990
 three things most visible on sight and 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.940
 she and then after I always 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.680
 finally I do not know I shot I 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.390
 maybe a little harder can be a 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.310
 little harder especially in the work 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.739
 maybe a little more demanding and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.340
 and not really seems a little bit of luck 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.140
 more serene 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.220
 that sounds a bit contradictory 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.470
 but I think that finally the fact 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750
 to be square to be organized allows me 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.000
 to be more serene inside you have 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 15 seconds for a huge flash back 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.940
 I want you to show me that jenny 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 it's also hip hop here in the world or 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.050
 no myst dj is putting up the pressure in 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.720
 the room is the explosion a guy 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.519
 it lists more 0 I even know more 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.030
 the lyrics are good I'm breaking you 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.030
 second there
