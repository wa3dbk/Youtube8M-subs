how much of each fuel source your body

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.890 
how much of each fuel source your body
uses<00:01:58.380> depends<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.070> how<00:01:59.250> Stransky<00:01:59.970> activity<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.370 
uses depends on how Stransky activity is
to<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:02.520> always<00:02:02.790> uses<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.450> mixture<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.990> both

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
to do it always uses a mixture of both

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.010 
to do it always uses a mixture of both
but<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> more<00:02:05.490> strain<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.270> activity<00:02:06.900> is

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
but the more strain is the activity is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.770 
but the more strain is the activity is
the<00:02:07.830> more<00:02:08.160> fuel<00:02:08.930> comes<00:02:09.930> from<00:02:10.230> carbohydrates

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the more fuel comes from carbohydrates

imagine you are a marathon runner and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.020 
imagine you are a marathon runner and
you<00:03:28.280> aim<00:03:28.700> for<00:03:29.060> running<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.720> whole<00:03:30.050> 42

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
you aim for running the whole 42

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.540 
you aim for running the whole 42

what<00:03:37.550> happens<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.240> marathon<00:03:38.570> runner

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
what happens to this marathon runner

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.480 
what happens to this marathon runner
when<00:03:40.400> he<00:03:40.700> runs<00:03:41.150> out<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:42.250> carbohydrates<00:03:43.250> at

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
when he runs out of carbohydrates at

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.780 
when he runs out of carbohydrates at
kilometer<00:03:43.850> journey<00:03:44.950> he<00:03:45.950> won't<00:03:46.130> be<00:03:46.310> able<00:03:46.430> to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
kilometer journey he won't be able to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.260 
kilometer journey he won't be able to
keep<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.110> speed<00:03:48.530> he<00:03:48.890> has<00:03:49.160> kept<00:03:49.520> up<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.820> this

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
keep up the speed he has kept up to this

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.690 
keep up the speed he has kept up to this
point<00:03:50.860> because<00:03:52.120> just<00:03:53.120> as<00:03:53.240> we<00:03:53.390> said<00:03:53.860> even<00:03:54.860> when

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
point because just as we said even when

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.540 
point because just as we said even when
most<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.540> energy<00:03:57.110> your<00:03:57.320> body<00:03:57.350> uses<00:03:58.220> comes

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
most of the energy your body uses comes

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.660 
most of the energy your body uses comes
from<00:03:58.880> fat<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.390> still<00:03:59.720> burn<00:04:00.170> some

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
from fat you still burn some

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.890 
from fat you still burn some
carbohydrates<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.850> if<00:04:02.120> there<00:04:02.360> aren't<00:04:02.690> any

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
carbohydrates and if there aren't any

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.310 
carbohydrates and if there aren't any
carbohydrates<00:04:03.680> anymore<00:04:04.190> available<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:06.080> will

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
carbohydrates anymore available you will

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.880 
carbohydrates anymore available you will
run<00:04:06.739> into<00:04:07.100> problems<00:04:07.810> because<00:04:08.810> breaking<00:04:09.620> down

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
run into problems because breaking down

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.760 
run into problems because breaking down
fat<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:11.239> fuel<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.020> more<00:04:12.350> complicated

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
fat for fuel is a more complicated

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.810 
fat for fuel is a more complicated
process<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:14.030> takes<00:04:14.690> longer<00:04:15.470> time

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
process and takes longer time

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.020 
process and takes longer time
so<00:04:17.450> what<00:04:17.660> marathon<00:04:18.230> runners<00:04:18.620> do<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.850> they

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
so what marathon runners do is is they

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.640 
so what marathon runners do is is they
try<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.980> aim<00:04:21.980> at<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.340> speed<00:04:23.060> where<00:04:23.870> still<00:04:24.260> most

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
try to aim at a speed where still most

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.210 
try to aim at a speed where still most
of<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.160> energy<00:04:25.730> they<00:04:26.000> use<00:04:26.440> comes<00:04:27.440> from<00:04:27.830> fat

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
of the energy they use comes from fat

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.350 
of the energy they use comes from fat
and<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:29.480> they<00:04:29.630> will<00:04:29.930> keep<00:04:31.360> carbohydrates

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
and that they will keep carbohydrates

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.770 
and that they will keep carbohydrates
available<00:04:33.290> until<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.740> very<00:04:34.100> end<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.820> their

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
run what does this mean for those of you

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.000 
run what does this mean for those of you

now<00:05:28.470> finally<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:29.190> might<00:05:29.430> say<00:05:29.790> hey<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:31.560> I'll

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
now finally you might say hey so I'll

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.250 
now finally you might say hey so I'll
just<00:05:32.100> run<00:05:32.430> at<00:05:32.640> fifty<00:05:33.000> percent<00:05:33.030> of<00:05:33.630> my<00:05:33.810> maximum

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
just run at fifty percent of my maximum

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.140 
just run at fifty percent of my maximum
heart<00:05:34.500> rate<00:05:34.650> because<00:05:35.010> then<00:05:35.490> most<00:05:35.790> of<00:05:35.970> the

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
heart rate because then most of the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.350 
heart rate because then most of the
energy<00:05:36.480> my<00:05:36.720> body<00:05:37.080> uses<00:05:37.650> will<00:05:38.430> come<00:05:38.730> from<00:05:39.000> fat

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
energy my body uses will come from fat

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.030 
energy my body uses will come from fat
and<00:05:39.780> I'll<00:05:40.710> lose<00:05:40.980> more<00:05:41.310> fat<00:05:41.580> then<00:05:42.080> no<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:43.920> I'll

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
and I'll lose more fat then no and I'll

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.980 
and I'll lose more fat then no and I'll
give<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.430> simple<00:05:44.940> equation<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.570> explain
