00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.780 
I'll take the bone away from them I mean
it's<00:00:52.650> really<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.980> big<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.430> deal<00:00:53.610> but

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
it's really not that big of a deal but

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.640 
it's really not that big of a deal but
they<00:00:53.910> usually<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.870> too<00:00:55.050> hard<00:00:55.290> for<00:00:55.350> them

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
they usually it's too hard for them

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.290 
they usually it's too hard for them
right<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.220> mean<00:00:56.610> they're<00:00:56.760> only<00:00:56.879> six<00:00:57.150> weeks

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
right now I mean they're only six weeks

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.229 
right now I mean they're only six weeks
old<00:00:57.540> but<00:00:58.470> they<00:00:58.949> pull<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.339> meat<00:00:59.489> off<00:00:59.550> really

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
old but they pull the meat off really

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:17.360 
old but they pull the meat off really
well<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.809> clean<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.290> well<00:01:16.370> and

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
well they can clean it really well and

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.250 
well they can clean it really well and
that<00:01:18.000> normally<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> would<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> fat<00:01:19.050> off

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
that normally I would take the fat off

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.770 
that normally I would take the fat off
and<00:01:19.620> I<00:01:19.800> probably<00:01:20.070> should<00:01:20.370> have<00:01:20.550> just<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.480> FYI

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and I probably should have just an FYI

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.050 
and I probably should have just an FYI
for<00:01:21.930> those<00:01:22.170> wanting<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.010> do<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.520> usually

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
for those wanting to do this usually

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
for those wanting to do this usually
take<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> fat<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.050> just<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.920> didn't<00:01:26.370> and
