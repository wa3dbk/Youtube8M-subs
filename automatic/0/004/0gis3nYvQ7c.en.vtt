00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.240
 Hello everyone for the product test of 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.090
 today I decided to try this cake 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.330
 of paneangeli which is a cake at 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.029
 lemon a preparation for lemon cake 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.300
 like everyone prepared at least 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.340
 those we tell them hot because those 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.590
 there in cold it usually should not be added 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.300
 nothing instead where box milita 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.369
 we have to add something in this 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.059
 case for this kind of cake we have to 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.040
 add three eggs and 200 ml of cream from 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.900
 to assemble all in all I am not 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.750
 lots of ingredients anyway then man 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.280
 hand we will evaluate during construction 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.019
 now I'm going to read them instead 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760
 ingredients that make up ours 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.769
 prepared as always you 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.839
 help yourself with the strange ingredients of 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.809
 I recommend then inside the 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.629
 mixture for the dough we find sugar 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.869
 type 00 soft wheat flour unless 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.190
 wheat starch blue glucose syrup 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:03.549
 with the actor this one the first time 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.159
 which met him sodium hydrogen carbonate 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:09.890
 phosphate world kicks in and then how 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.890
 exciting there are being lactic and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.380
 from the 16 of mono and diglycerides of the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.320
 protein fatty acids in milk milk 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.860
 skimmed powder natural flavorings gum 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.290
 of xanthen and then potassium phosphate e 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 dehydrated lemon juice 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.490
 there are two or three ingredients that do not 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.840
 I can therefore identify how 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.880
 always us 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.740
 write me if ingredients are themselves 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.370
 good or not and asks for much more 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.040
 a must for all in all we 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.310
 go find the favor then now 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.880
 the other with you the box 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.960
 it comes out from inside we find the envelope 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.000
 of the mixture and a sachet of sugar 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.939
 icing to go and decorate the cake 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.649
 for this type of preparation you need one 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:03.549
 24 cm mold now I'm going to prepare it 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.240
 so I go to get my preparation 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:12.730
 now inside a container 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.920
 all we hear a little believe rea has 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.600
 a lemon smell 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 then I go to put all the cream 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.090
 and finally the three eggs 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.340
 after which we should mix everything 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.840
 with the help of electric whips for 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.549
 three minutes until completely absorbed 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.860
 of the dough so all in all a 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.840
 very very fast preparation later 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660
 having then mixed the three minutes on 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.470
 our dough I have to say came beautiful 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.620
 creamy 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.269
 as you can see let's go then to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.910
 put it in a baking pan 24 e 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.250
 then something that I liked very much 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.100
 that makes paneangeli and that does not 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.470
 I create it and that on the back of the instructions 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.290
 the oven temperature is written a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 depending on the ovens you have at home what 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.459
 very helpful 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.799
 in fact, depending on whether the oven is 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.109
 electric fan or gas from one 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.810
 different temperature with timing 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.030
 equal then our cake will have to 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.660
 always cook 5 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.720
 minutes but if the electric oven at 150 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.490
 degrees is formed the ventilated to 146 forms 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.069
 square 160 years anyway 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.900
 a very useful indication that has me 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.040
 let it get a little point than this 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.959
 cake 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.540
 now then sent to bake for 50 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.370
 minutes and then we'll see the result 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.120
 after 50 minutes the cake is 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.920
 actually ready and the reply 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.950
 which has perfect cooking either 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.380
 outside than inside 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.820
 I see this from the edges I don't know if 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.739
 you can see where you are a little 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.750
 unplugged the product when I went 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.519
 then remove it from the pan 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.190
 eventually I advise you to use 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.660
 the parchment paper that is on the airport 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.750
 written that can be used either 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.700
 parchment paper that butter flour marco del 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.090
 butter and flour well to be a little bit 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.299
 a few bits now we go to 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.700
 taste it I take a bit of 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:31.770
 this one red inside i have 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:36.360
 taken from the pan then it tastes 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:40.320
 very very intense of lemon even though it is 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.410
 a little bit artificial is a good taste 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.030
 but if you do n't prefer those flavors 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.360
 very strong lemon very very intense 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.860
 artificial precisely this door does not 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.500
 for you 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.380
 but if you like the taste of champions or 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.910
 you know that lemon icicles 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.440
 taste a little intense this lemon 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.750
 type of product is fine for you 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.290
 I also say sparkling candy 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.020
 for a while this studs are anyway 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.530
 succeeded in achieving it in very little 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.650
 time 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.000
 so let's analyze the various ones a bit 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.090
 wait 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.030
 first the price quality is a 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.630
 good product because I managed to 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.490
 get a nice cake from the tag 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.090
 all indications were excellent 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.550
 but I paid two euros fifty 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.860
 the box inside 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.230
 basically he had the compound 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.190
 solid to which, however, I have had to 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.840
 add wall and cream then for 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.400
 what concerns the price quality 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.320
 I can't give a good grade because 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.820
 compared to a homemade product but 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.090
 we do n't want to spend much more 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.190
 so I give enough one for 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.200
 what concerns the aspect obtained 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.110
 really a good result I am happy 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.470
 the cake is cooked evenly 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.490
 high evenly cooked inside and 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.250
 on the outside 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.860
 so for what concerns the appearance 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.470
 really a good result to give too 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:16.440
 a name for what concerns the 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:18.270
 flavor do a 7 diplomatic because I do not 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.790
 I told you before I don't prefer the 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.450
 artificial flavor of lemon but there are 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.100
 people who may like it for what 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.380
 it concerns instead in times of preparation 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.479
 as much as I put it anyway 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.669
 little time for preparation itself 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.520
 this type of cake is also homemade 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.770
 they don't take so long 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.259
 if not actually going to weigh the 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.150
 flour the yeast therefore really stood 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.530
 going to save very very little to 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.460
 time level so that what 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.280
 you would like to attribute a sufficiency 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:53.240
 so my general vote for this 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.490
 cake is seven and a half more than anything else 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.349
 because I am not very happy with the 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.860
 lemon flavor that being a cake 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.550
 lemon 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.039
 I expected it to be a little bit more 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.750
 tasty at the level of naturalness e 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.659
 instead I had found this flavor 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.750
 a little artificial I hope this 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:13.580
 review all you need is a kiss 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.599
 give us the next video review 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.409
 each recipe 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.409
 bye Bye
