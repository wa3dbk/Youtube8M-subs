00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
you think you just upgraded the graphics

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.850 
you think you just upgraded the graphics
card<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:17.450> that's<00:02:17.750> clearly<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.830> case

what's undeniable though and you just

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.470 
what's undeniable though and you just
have<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.250> agree<00:03:07.430> with<00:03:07.520> me<00:03:07.820> on<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:07.940> one<00:03:08.120> is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
have to agree with me on this one is

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.570 
have to agree with me on this one is
that<00:03:08.900> Intel<00:03:09.260> currently<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.920> way<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.340> go

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
that Intel currently is the way to go

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.060 
that Intel currently is the way to go
when<00:03:10.760> wanting<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.180> solid<00:03:11.660> CPU<00:03:12.110> that's<00:03:12.620> good<00:03:12.860> for

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
when wanting a solid CPU that's good for

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.520 
when wanting a solid CPU that's good for
basically<00:03:13.580> everything<00:03:14.450> from<00:03:14.630> gaming<00:03:15.200> to

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
basically everything from gaming to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.680 
basically everything from gaming to

rendering then there of course is the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.660 
rendering then there of course is the
massive<00:03:18.410> price<00:03:18.709> difference<00:03:19.130> between<00:03:19.489> these

massive price difference between these
three<00:03:19.730> processors<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:20.840> my<00:03:21.140> opinion<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.620> FX<00:03:21.890> 95

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
three processors in my opinion the FX 95

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.430 
three processors in my opinion the FX 95
90<00:03:22.640> isn't<00:03:22.880> exactly<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.360> good<00:03:23.510> processor<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.290> go

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
90 isn't exactly a good processor to go

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.640 
90 isn't exactly a good processor to go
for<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.980> FX<00:03:25.250> 8350<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.239> much<00:03:26.540> much<00:03:26.870> cheaper<00:03:26.930> and

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
for the FX 8350 is much much cheaper and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.800 
for the FX 8350 is much much cheaper and

you to overclock to the level of that 95
90<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:32.870> when<00:03:33.020> looking<00:03:33.140> at<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.470> prices<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:33.950> the

decision

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
decision

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.750

I<00:03:38.720> mean<00:03:39.140> technically<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.950> dead<00:03:40.220> easy<00:03:40.489> one

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
I mean technically it's a dead easy one

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.729 
I mean technically it's a dead easy one
however<00:03:41.360> I'm<00:03:41.540> not<00:03:41.720> moving<00:03:42.140> on<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.500> topic
