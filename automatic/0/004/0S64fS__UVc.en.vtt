00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340

personally I preferred the extended cut
I<00:00:25.550> just<00:00:25.760> thought<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.230> kind<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.350> explains<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
I just thought it kind of explains the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.220 
I just thought it kind of explains the
story<00:00:28.160> a<00:00:28.250> little<00:00:28.340> better<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:29.000> yeah<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.109> that's

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
story a little better and yeah so that's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.619 
story a little better and yeah so that's
the<00:00:30.410> cut<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:30.890> prefer<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:32.149> it's<00:00:32.389> nice<00:00:32.599> that
