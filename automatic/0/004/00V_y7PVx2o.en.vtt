00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
maybe like a four or five cell setup so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.520 
maybe like a four or five cell setup so
pretty<00:00:55.780> easy<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:56.050> put<00:00:56.140> together

so although it is a sixteen hundred and
twenty<00:01:05.199> millimeter<00:01:05.530> wingspan<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:06.250> does<00:01:06.430> break

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
twenty millimeter wingspan it does break

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.660 
twenty millimeter wingspan it does break
apart<00:01:06.940> nicely<00:01:07.300> for<00:01:07.510> transportation<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:08.670> even
