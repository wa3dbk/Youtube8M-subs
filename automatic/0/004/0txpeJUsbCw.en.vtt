00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
asked you it's so cool-looking you have

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
asked you it's so cool-looking you have
to<00:00:41.610> figure<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> put<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> there

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
to figure out a way to put that in there

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.400 
to figure out a way to put that in there
it's<00:00:45.500> just<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.770> us<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.359> seems<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:49.969> this

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
it's just about us so it seems like this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.880 
it's just about us so it seems like this
kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:55.969> mean<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> thing<00:00:57.890> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
kind of I mean this kind of a thing but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
kind of I mean this kind of a thing but
maybe<00:00:59.429> like<00:00:59.989> make<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.609> dirty<00:01:02.870> yeah<00:01:03.890> or

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
maybe like make it more dirty yeah or

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.940 
maybe like make it more dirty yeah or
dirty<00:01:05.400> or<00:01:05.550> blurred<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.260> yeah<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:09.950> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
dirty or blurred or yeah so it's it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
dirty or blurred or yeah so it's it
would<00:01:11.070> help<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.340> pick<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> guys<00:01:11.940> in<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
would help you pick out the guys in the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.190 
would help you pick out the guys in the
dark<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.100> wouldn't<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:16.050> wouldn't

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
dark but you wouldn't you wouldn't

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.740 
dark but you wouldn't you wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:16.380> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.800> keep<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.310> them

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
necessarily want to keep on all of them

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.550 
necessarily want to keep on all of them
yeah<00:01:19.710> she<00:01:19.890> definitely<00:01:19.980> be<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> trade-off<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
yeah she definitely be a trade-off I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.480 
yeah she definitely be a trade-off I
don't<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.800> trade-off<00:01:23.130> should<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
don't know what the trade-off should be

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.640 
don't know what the trade-off should be
would<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.000> able<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.300> have<00:01:24.480> a<00:01:24.510> blend<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.260> so

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
would we be able to have a blend like so

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.640 
would we be able to have a blend like so
as<00:01:25.980> you're<00:01:26.850> starting<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.870> area

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
as you're starting to go out of a area

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.920 
as you're starting to go out of a area
that<00:01:28.860> has<00:01:29.040> less<00:01:29.220> power<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.300> just<00:01:30.510> based<00:01:30.720> on

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that has less power I like just based on

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370 
that has less power I like just based on
the<00:01:30.990> lighting<00:01:31.500> power<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.990> wouldn't

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the lighting power so it wouldn't

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.070 
the lighting power so it wouldn't
believe<00:01:35.010> like<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.820> turned<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
believe like I just turned on or off it

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.590 
believe like I just turned on or off it
would<00:01:37.410> be<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.790> effect<00:01:39.150> gets<00:01:39.270> more

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
would be like it the effect gets more

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.530 
would be like it the effect gets more
subdued<00:01:40.410> as<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.000> world<00:01:42.210> starts

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
subdued as you think the world starts

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.580 
subdued as you think the world starts
coming<00:01:42.780> back<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.640> start<00:01:44.640> fading<00:01:44.910> out<00:01:45.150> as

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
coming back in and start fading out as

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.499 
coming back in and start fading out as
your<00:01:46.590> transition<00:01:47.550> my<00:01:47.670> way<00:01:47.790> from<00:01:48.140> oh<00:01:49.140> yeah<00:01:49.619> sure

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
your transition my way from oh yeah sure

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.320 
your transition my way from oh yeah sure
that's<00:01:51.509> easy<00:01:54.320> what<00:01:55.320> what<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.610> baby<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.149> gas

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
that's easy what what so baby the gas

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.060 
that's easy what what so baby the gas
flow<00:01:57.509> was<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.460> oh<00:01:59.460> that's<00:02:00.330> trivial<00:02:00.740> yeah<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
flow was like oh that's trivial yeah I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.010 
flow was like oh that's trivial yeah I
know<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> hot<00:02:02.790> loading<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.450> actually<00:02:03.840> see

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
know the hot loading and actually see

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
know the hot loading and actually see
that<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.320> sleep<00:02:11.390> didn't<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.700> cold<00:02:14.970> he<00:02:15.450> was

direction Yeah Yeah Yeah right okay all
your<00:06:01.979> yeah<00:06:02.520> that's<00:06:03.090> strange<00:06:04.099> well<00:06:05.099> it<00:06:05.400> depends

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
your yeah that's strange well it depends

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.430 
your yeah that's strange well it depends
if<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.240> was<00:06:06.360> representing<00:06:06.870> some<00:06:06.990> like<00:06:07.110> sonar

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
if it was representing some like sonar

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.730 
if it was representing some like sonar
it<00:06:07.500> actually<00:06:07.740> makes<00:06:07.860> sense<00:06:08.270> well<00:06:09.270> that's<00:06:09.509> true

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
it actually makes sense well that's true

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.200 
it actually makes sense well that's true
we<00:06:10.740> should<00:06:10.919> totally<00:06:11.370> just<00:06:11.610> put<00:06:11.789> that<00:06:11.819> a<00:06:11.910> person

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
we should totally just put that a person

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.490 
we should totally just put that a person
at<00:06:12.389> least<00:06:12.509> scanner<00:06:12.840> sweep<00:06:13.080> or<00:06:13.199> something<00:06:13.440> I

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
at least scanner sweep or something I

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.350 
at least scanner sweep or something I
mean<00:06:13.650> like<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:14.069> problem<00:06:14.910> is<00:06:15.830> sonar<00:06:16.830> we<00:06:16.949> call

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
mean like the problem is sonar we call

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.830 
mean like the problem is sonar we call
I'm<00:06:18.360> sure<00:06:18.569> if<00:06:18.660> we<00:06:18.690> could<00:06:18.840> work<00:06:19.050> it<00:06:19.199> for<00:06:19.349> sanity

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
I'm sure if we could work it for sanity

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:32.450 
I'm sure if we could work it for sanity
well<00:06:21.840> that's<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.199> composer<00:06:22.680> is<00:06:24.680> so<00:06:25.680> cool<00:06:31.460> you
