be actually on already I don't know it's
a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:44.970> too<00:01:45.180> light<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.049> I'll

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
a little too light for me to see I'll

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
a little too light for me to see I'll
just<00:01:47.009> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> cut<00:01:47.820> away<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.090> rock<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.630> own

just kind of cut away some rock your own
okay<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> fold<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.030> fulbright<00:01:51.420> does<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.960> uh

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
okay so fold what fulbright does is uh

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
okay so fold what fulbright does is uh
you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.299> farther<00:01:54.509> away

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you know how as as you get farther away

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
you know how as as you get farther away
from<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> source<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> light<00:01:55.470> though<00:01:55.649> it'll

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
from the source of light though it'll

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.800 
from the source of light though it'll
start<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> diminish<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
start to diminish and when you're in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.969 
start to diminish and when you're in
caves<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.229> actually<00:01:58.469> had<00:01:58.560> need<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> place

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
caves you actually had need to place

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
caves you actually had need to place
torches<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.729> what<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.750> basically

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
torches now what this does is basically

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
torches now what this does is basically
make<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.549> never<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.270> place

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
make it so that you never have to place

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
make it so that you never have to place
torches<00:02:03.810> again<00:02:03.990> I'll<00:02:04.170> stick<00:02:04.829> down<00:02:05.009> will

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
torches again I'll stick down will

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
torches again I'll stick down will
probably<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> quicker<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.810> it's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
probably be quicker you can see it's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 
probably be quicker you can see it's
starting<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.290> dark<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:08.569> okay<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.720> a
