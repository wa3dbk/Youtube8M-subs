 departed here and about the series about 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.100
 letplayev I created a schedule like 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.579
 such a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 v-shaped for myself and i want you now 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 you look at him carefully and in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 in general, I will try to get out now 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 The remaining days of the holidays are up to 11 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.879
 numbers to produce a series like mine 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930
 written on the screen but this schedule is not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.400
 one hundred percent 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.750
 you if I do not let any day 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.670
 series you do not be discouraged just 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.290
 think about what the repair thing 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.979
 unpredictable for example yesterday to me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.080
 had to tear off the wallpaper 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.509
 then I slept for four o'clock in the afternoon then 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.780
 would say would be tired to have an abortion and creepy 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.659
 thing 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 the dirtiest the nastiest especially 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.270
 when not to restrain one more similarity 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.130
 at night she slept like a dead man 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 I slept well at night it's me the other way around 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 pleased because the previous night 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 i was not very good i slept very much 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.640
 bad but those who read my twitter they 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.579
 could read what I wrote about 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 that I don't sleep well in general yes this is the first 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.740
 news 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
 what is being done in my room 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.790
 is it that the release of the series I do not know how 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.140
 it will turn out like this but in general 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.950
 before your eyes 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.240
 schedule yes well in general, the following 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.460
 the news about studying is about my 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.340
 many people know and I'm in 10th grade 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.310
 yes it is true the idea is to study in 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.629
 tenth grade, but in general I will tell 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.500
 I decided to pass 10 and 11 class in one 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.450
 academic year 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.300
 that is, finish school earlier than not 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.700
 this is why this year I study 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.310
 very much so because because I 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.170
 if I only gave 10 I would 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.930
 studied so well, only one-tenth as Chela 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.580
 I have to learn 10 by December and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.660
 pass all exams 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.580
 and then thinking to learn 11 pass 11 here 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.120
 so that's why I study in twins 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.980
 more serious and about the release of the series I 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.690
 of course I will try to do them all of course 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.550
 they will come out I will not 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.980
 such that I will have stagnation and I do not 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.380
 I can not produce video for three months 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.570

 everything is actually delivered to my school you 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.300

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.739

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.660
 my major, I had a new 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:45.060
 all small dog breed 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.150
 yorkshire terrier little dog 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.670
 which will grow and will weigh 1 and 5 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.860
 kilogram is generally very small and in 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.930
 In general, she is now a puppy and therefore as 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.720
 you know you need to take the time of the dog and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.450
 and bring up so she grew good and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.650
 good physicist we still have old 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.329
 a dog that is 6 years and 1's, too 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.640
 very cool and how we developed it 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.739
 another friend of mine made a companion so 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.380

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.890
 Him that is, and she more place openly 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.080
 than for example for other small breeds 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.250
 dogs and more than any public 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.220
 places open 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.070

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.810

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.170
