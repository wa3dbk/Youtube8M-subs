it's it's good for holding delicate

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.510 
it's it's good for holding delicate
parts<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.070> clamping<00:00:29.310> pressure

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
parts because you're clamping pressure

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.340

is<00:00:29.970> real<00:00:30.180> easy<00:00:30.360> to<00:00:30.420> control<00:00:30.750> you're<00:00:31.170> just

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
is real easy to control you're just

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.279 
is real easy to control you're just
using<00:00:31.530> an<00:00:31.740> allen<00:00:32.009> wrench<00:00:32.039> to<00:00:32.219> tighten<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.640> and
