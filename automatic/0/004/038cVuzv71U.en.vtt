in<00:01:21.900> there<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.710> had<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> big

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
in there like are we are we had a big

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
in there like are we are we had a big
ship<00:01:23.340> no<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.299> an<00:01:24.360> island<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
ship no it's actually an island this

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.679 
ship no it's actually an island this
level<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.009> larger<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:27.299> sub<00:01:27.570> pens

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
level is it's larger than that sub pens

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
level is it's larger than that sub pens
but<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> probably<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> smallest<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.820> in

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
but it is probably the smallest one in

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.290

this<00:01:30.000> map

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
this map

what's<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.110> great<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:32.070> rather<00:01:32.640> than

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
what's really great is is rather than

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.220 
what's really great is is rather than
having<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> assault<00:01:33.600> through<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> front<00:01:33.990> door

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the structure you can actually it many

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.920 
the structure you can actually it many
times<00:01:38.070> climb<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.790> face<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
times climb right up the face of this

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.620 
times climb right up the face of this
this<00:01:40.260> 40-degree<00:01:40.740> angle<00:01:40.920> slanted<00:01:41.580> wall<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
this 40-degree angle slanted wall and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.670 
this 40-degree angle slanted wall and
they<00:01:42.690> find<00:01:42.900> right<00:01:43.050> in<00:01:43.140> through<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.320> windows

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
they find right in through the windows

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
they find right in through the windows
so<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:44.520> creates<00:01:44.820> almost<00:01:44.940> this<00:01:45.120> infinite

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so if it creates almost this infinite

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.720 
so if it creates almost this infinite
infinite<00:01:46.260> point<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:46.920> penetration<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
infinite point of penetration for the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.940 
infinite point of penetration for the
players<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.230> keep<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.590> team

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
players which is going to keep the team

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.640 
players which is going to keep the team
particularly<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.580> inside<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> facility

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
particularly was inside the facility

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.910 
particularly was inside the facility
constantly<00:01:52.650> on<00:01:52.770> their<00:01:52.920> toes<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:55.410> final<00:01:55.770> map

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
constantly on their toes the final map

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.400 
constantly on their toes the final map
is<00:01:56.130> called<00:01:56.460> revolution<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.870> takes<00:01:58.050> place<00:01:58.230> on

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
is called revolution it takes place on

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
in this in it we call it zombie factory

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.929 
in this in it we call it zombie factory
in<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.709> studio<00:03:10.010> because<00:03:10.189> it<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.489> taking<00:03:10.849> place

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
getting overrun basically you just say

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.939 
getting overrun basically you just say
Matt<00:03:50.659> day<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.870> know<00:03:51.019> teleport<00:03:51.470> teleport<00:03:51.560> get

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
Matt day you know teleport teleport get

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.650 
Matt day you know teleport teleport get
out<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.129> there<00:03:52.250> also<00:03:52.730> any<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.120> our<00:03:53.239> weapons<00:03:53.540> i

out of there also any of our weapons i

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.659 
out of there also any of our weapons i
think<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:53.959> 16<00:03:54.470> upgradeable<00:03:55.220> weapons<00:03:55.489> now

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
think it's 16 upgradeable weapons now

you're going to be able to upgrade with

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.289 
you're going to be able to upgrade with
what's<00:03:57.560> called<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.859> pack<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.069> punch<00:03:58.370> machine<00:03:58.549> so

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
what's called a pack a punch machine so

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.909 
what's called a pack a punch machine so
you<00:03:59.780> spend<00:04:00.019> your<00:04:00.139> money<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.500> put<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.769> in<00:04:00.859> the

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
you spend your money you put it in the

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.379 
you spend your money you put it in the
machine<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.340> comes<00:04:01.519> back<00:04:01.730> out<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.090> all<00:04:02.239> of<00:04:02.299> a

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
machine it comes back out and all of a

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.180 
machine it comes back out and all of a
sudden<00:04:02.419> is<00:04:02.720> going<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.930> fire<00:04:03.139> much<00:04:03.949> more

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
sudden is going to fire much more

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.830 
sudden is going to fire much more
explosive<00:04:04.609> rounds<00:04:05.150> much<00:04:05.299> for<00:04:05.419> damaging

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
explosive rounds much for damaging

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.750 
explosive rounds much for damaging
rounds<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:06.530> might<00:04:06.709> behave<00:04:07.010> differently<00:04:07.519> if

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
rounds it might behave differently if

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.280 
rounds it might behave differently if
you<00:04:07.819> put<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.120> VAR<00:04:08.389> and<00:04:08.720> then<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.930> comes<00:04:09.049> out

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
you put the VAR and then it comes out

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.800 
you put the VAR and then it comes out
you<00:04:10.010> actually<00:04:10.310> could<00:04:10.459> run<00:04:10.609> faster<00:04:10.790> with<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.389> so

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
you actually could run faster with it so

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.869 
you actually could run faster with it so
now<00:04:11.989> rather<00:04:12.680> than<00:04:12.829> rather<00:04:13.250> than<00:04:13.459> opening<00:04:13.669> up

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
now rather than rather than opening up

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.729 
now rather than rather than opening up
the<00:04:13.970> mystery<00:04:14.209> box<00:04:14.419> you<00:04:14.750> get<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.900> car<00:04:15.109> 98<00:04:15.409> and<00:04:15.650> you
