00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
bunch of different variety that I think

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.150 
bunch of different variety that I think
all<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.809> combined<00:00:16.260> has<00:00:16.529> made<00:00:16.710> her<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> much

all of that combined has made her a much

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.750 
all of that combined has made her a much
stronger<00:00:17.460> skater<00:00:18.800> our<00:00:19.800> FMC<00:00:20.310> development

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
stronger skater our FMC development

stronger skater our FMC development
programs<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.270> split<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:21.570> two<00:00:21.810> different

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
programs are split into two different

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.900 
programs are split into two different
programs<00:00:22.530> one<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:22.980> our<00:00:23.190> learn<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> skate<00:00:23.670> which
