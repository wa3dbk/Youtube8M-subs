00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.380 
increase the radius to about 400 to be
larger<00:01:16.920> than<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> earth<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:18.270> I'll

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
larger than the earth then I'll

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
larger than the earth then I'll
reposition<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.049> text<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> earth<00:01:19.979> and

reposition the text around the earth and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
reposition the text around the earth and
the<00:01:20.220> canvas<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> text<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.140> wrapped

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the canvas the text is now wrapped

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
the canvas the text is now wrapped
around<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> object<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.360> want

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
around the object but what I really want

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
around the object but what I really want
is<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> wrap<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> around<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.470> 3d<00:01:25.770> space<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
is to wrap it around in 3d space so that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.399 
is to wrap it around in 3d space so that
it<00:01:27.030> goes<00:01:27.180> behind<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.049> front<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.320> the

it goes behind and in front of the
object<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.909> I'll<00:01:30.479> select<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.020> adjust

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

3d<00:01:31.829> transform<00:01:32.400> tool<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> canvas

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
3d transform tool then in the canvas

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
3d transform tool then in the canvas
I'll<00:01:34.470> hold<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> shift<00:01:35.340> key<00:01:35.460> while
