00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.209 
this to work for me and for somebody
with<00:01:56.520> lots<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.000> shrinkage<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.840> don't<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.710> if

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
with lots of shrinkage I don't know if

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.700 
with lots of shrinkage I don't know if
this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> fine<00:02:00.149> hair<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.140> thick<00:02:01.530> for

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
this is a fine hair if it's thick for

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.440 
this is a fine hair if it's thick for
finding<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.070> hair's<00:02:02.250> very<00:02:02.460> fine<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> guess

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
finding my hair's very fine and I guess

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.190 
finding my hair's very fine and I guess
when<00:02:03.810> it's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
when it's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.469 
when it's
just<00:02:04.649> since<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.280> very<00:02:05.460> quietly<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> same

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
just since it's very quietly at the same

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.770 
just since it's very quietly at the same
time<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.079> shrinks<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.489> hair<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.060> shoulder

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
time it just shrinks my hair is shoulder

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.119 
time it just shrinks my hair is shoulder
length<00:02:10.110> probably<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.560> don't<00:02:10.649> i<00:02:10.890> haven't

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
length probably i don't i haven't

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.890 
length probably i don't i haven't
measured<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.519> in<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> while<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.569> probably

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
measured it in a while but it's probably

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.780 
measured it in a while but it's probably
its<00:02:13.440> shoulder<00:02:14.069> length<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.550> little

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
its shoulder length and a little

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.030 
its shoulder length and a little
probably<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> little<00:02:15.239> bit<00:02:15.390> longer<00:02:15.629> but<00:02:16.050> my<00:02:16.769> hair

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
probably a little bit longer but my hair

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
well but that's actually an alternative

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.789

conditioner and another old one that I

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.730 
conditioner and another old one that I
just<00:04:26.250> didn't<00:04:26.580> really<00:04:26.820> like<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.720> use<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.290> I

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
just didn't really like but I use that I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.470 
just didn't really like but I use that I
put<00:04:28.950> two<00:04:29.130> teaspoons<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.150> cook<00:04:30.330> this

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
put two teaspoons of that cook this

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.630 
put two teaspoons of that cook this
baking<00:04:31.080> soda<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.560> my<00:04:31.800> condition<00:04:32.070> or<00:04:32.490> deep

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
baking soda in my condition or deep

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.950 
baking soda in my condition or deep
conditioner<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.330> what<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.260> does<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:35.960> pulls

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
conditioner and what it does is it pulls

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.010 
conditioner and what it does is it pulls
the<00:04:37.230> moisture<00:04:37.260> from<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.720> conditioners<00:04:39.720> and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
the moisture from the conditioners and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.730 
the moisture from the conditioners and
puts<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.010> into<00:04:41.220> your<00:04:41.520> hair<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.570> guess<00:04:43.350> that's

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
puts it into your hair so I guess that's

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.240 
puts it into your hair so I guess that's
why<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.670> had<00:04:45.300> an<00:04:45.480> effective<00:04:46.170> I<00:04:46.530> just<00:04:47.040> had

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
why I had an effective I just had

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.730 
why I had an effective I just had
extreme<00:04:48.050> softness<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.230> my<00:04:49.320> hair<00:04:49.530> was<00:04:49.680> just

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
extreme softness and my hair was just

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.160 
extreme softness and my hair was just
extremely<00:04:50.160> strong<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.760> did<00:04:51.450> read<00:04:51.720> about<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.140> in

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
extremely strong I did read about it in

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.650 
extremely strong I did read about it in
a<00:04:52.290> few<00:04:52.320> lady<00:04:52.680> said<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.700> on<00:04:54.000> boosting<00:04:54.540> their

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
a few lady said it it on boosting their

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.659 
a few lady said it it on boosting their
textures<00:04:55.140> a<00:04:55.170> bit<00:04:55.500> but<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.980> didn't<00:04:56.250> really<00:04:56.370> have

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
textures a bit but I didn't really have

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.100 
textures a bit but I didn't really have
that<00:04:56.700> experience<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.600> don't<00:04:57.840> know<00:04:57.960> what<00:04:58.080> to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
that experience so I don't know what to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.890 
that experience so I don't know what to
say<00:04:58.200> about<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.980> guess<00:04:59.550> they<00:05:00.450> left<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.810> in

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
say about that I guess they left it in

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.950 
say about that I guess they left it in
longer<00:05:01.350> maybe<00:05:01.880> if<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.150> do<00:05:03.360> leave<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.840> little

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
longer maybe if you do leave it a little

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.240 
longer maybe if you do leave it a little
bit<00:05:04.169> longer<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.560> will<00:05:04.740> loosen<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.160> your

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
bit longer it will loosen up your

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.220 
bit longer it will loosen up your
texture<00:05:05.640> but<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:05.880> really<00:05:06.480> really<00:05:06.810> do<00:05:06.990> recommend

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
texture but I really really do recommend
