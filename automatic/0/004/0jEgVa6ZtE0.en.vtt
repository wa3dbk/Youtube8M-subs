00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.410
 hi friends now we are in the mission 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.270
 white on the roof we'll see what it is 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.369
 faster return business 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.470
 we come back with the helicopter this 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.930
 mission is the mission that is most done 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.390
 online for the money I gave for the rp 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.730
 however many prefer to take the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.730
 helicopter others prefer to get away from the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.059
 car and let's see what is faster and 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.300
 for how much greater then 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.699
 we already did the first part with the car 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.670
 we are in tourism r go 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.580
 quickly try ways to return what 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 faster clear possible also there is 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.360
 to stop suddenly you also have to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.320
 use the brake because otherwise 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 users 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.550
 well then here we are going to move on 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.980
 moving forward and let's go forward what is already 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.280
 almost eleven minutes a minute and almost 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.580
 we take then here in this return to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.740
 his fast return very very fast no 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.390
 we are right now when in the mission what 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.730
 what we want to do 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.380
 more general with 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.750
 let's say without the acid of 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.120
 vans to see how much is typical 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.220
 just thinking about making the trip 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.780
 as fast as possible 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
 that to tell to commit the best 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 time that is achieved with the car and I 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.140
 have a time for the helicopter that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 is the next one that we're going to see with the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.510
 helicopter we have already a point 24 and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.150
 we stopped this in one minute 26 a minute 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.460
 26 brings us back to the house of 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.200
 madrazo with the car now with a 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 helicopter let's see how much time 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.549
 we do 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.940
 and with the short one is easier only 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.090
 you have to return in a straight line and not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.830
 we have to worry about traffic 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.220
 that if the vans come to you 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.680
 following if you already escaped with a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.390
 car that you already passed the traffic lights and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.450
 out there you found a truck or 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.090
 is zero worry however the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.940
 use the helicopter here comes the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 let's say that the delicate part of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 subject the helicopter is a little more 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.350
 said land is difficult to go is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.180
 difficult to land then there if you go to 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.670
 need someone who knows how to land 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.280
 I'm practicing it a bit 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.160
 landing what I often do 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.170
 with my friends is when it touches me when 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.690
 I got to grab the helicopter is that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.269
 I only get upstairs from the house of 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.120
 madrazo a little bit that is not so so 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.370
 up and down them 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.239
 that's an easier way and here we go 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.239
 we did it in that 59 seconds 59 58 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.319
 seconds and that was with the helicopter 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.319
 goodbye friends
