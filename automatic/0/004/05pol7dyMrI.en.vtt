let's see in speed piano too this was

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.280 
let's see in speed piano too this was
really<00:02:54.140> hard<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:56.570> really<00:02:56.960> have<00:02:57.110> to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
really hard to do you really have to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.810 
really hard to do you really have to
reach<00:02:57.620> because<00:02:57.890> you're<00:02:58.070> already<00:02:58.400> at<00:02:58.670> an

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
reach because you're already at an

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.450 
reach because you're already at an
octave<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.750> if<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.590> want<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.070> thing<00:03:01.130> I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
octave so if you want to do that thing I

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.180 
octave so if you want to do that thing I

I don't play with my thumb no ring and
pinky<00:03:52.370> finger<00:03:52.790> because<00:03:53.390> your<00:03:53.540> pinky<00:03:53.900> is

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
pinky finger because your pinky is

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.660 
pinky finger because your pinky is
really<00:03:54.260> not<00:03:54.379> a<00:03:54.440> very<00:03:54.500> strong<00:03:55.010> finger<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.579> it's
