00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
lightning technology Apple is building

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.289 
lightning technology Apple is building
some<00:01:12.510> security<00:01:13.350> chips<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.340> said<00:01:14.790> even

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
some security chips in here said even

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
some security chips in here said even
though<00:01:15.509> you've<00:01:15.810> building<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> buying<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
though you've building a buying a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.240 
though you've building a buying a
rebuild<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.479> rebuild<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.020> still<00:01:19.320> cost<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
rebuild the rebuild will still cost you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.020 
rebuild the rebuild will still cost you
44<00:01:20.939> 45<00:01:21.570> euros<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.280> spend<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
44 45 euros so then you can spend a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
44 45 euros so then you can spend a
couple<00:01:24.210> extra<00:01:24.570> bucks<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> gets<00:01:25.799> original

from Apple so let's find out what's in
here<00:01:33.020> there<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.110> go

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
here there we go

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.850 
here there we go
so<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> adapter<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:37.759> no<00:01:38.759> stickers<00:01:39.210> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
some fine print here okay then let's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.050 
some fine print here okay then let's
take<00:01:45.270> our<00:01:45.509> adapter<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.610> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
take our adapter and that's it this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.230 
take our adapter and that's it this
little<00:01:48.570> piece<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.140> plastic<00:01:49.619> costs<00:01:50.009> 50<00:01:50.700> euros

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
little piece of plastic costs 50 euros

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
little piece of plastic costs 50 euros
we<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.540> our<00:01:51.720> lightning<00:01:52.049> port<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.040> our

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
we got our lightning port for all our

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.840 
we got our lightning port for all our
Lightning<00:01:54.149> iOS<00:01:55.079> devices<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.700> got

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
Lightning iOS devices and then we got

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.240 
Lightning iOS devices and then we got
our<00:01:56.880> HDMI<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.229> another<00:01:58.920> lightning

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
our HDMI here and another lightning

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
our HDMI here and another lightning
point<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> charge<00:02:00.719> your<00:02:00.960> device

by using the adapter don't worry the
adapter<00:02:04.619> will<00:02:04.799> work<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.369> well<00:02:05.790> even<00:02:06.119> without

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
adapter will work as well even without

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.350 
adapter will work as well even without
charging<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> device<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.160> let's<00:02:08.759> hook<00:02:09.239> it
