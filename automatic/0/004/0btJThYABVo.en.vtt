okay<00:00:01.860> so<00:00:01.920> here<00:00:02.879> we've<00:00:03.030> got<00:00:03.060> my<00:00:03.360> panasonic<00:00:03.840> DVD

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay so here we've got my panasonic DVD

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.720 
okay so here we've got my panasonic DVD
recorder<00:00:05.160> so<00:00:05.460> DMR<00:00:06.029> e^x<00:00:06.690> 75<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:08.280> about<00:00:08.400> five

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
recorder so DMR e^x 75 it's about five

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.330 
recorder so DMR e^x 75 it's about five
years<00:00:08.910> old<00:00:09.469> it<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.590> quite<00:00:10.769> expensive<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
years old it was quite expensive at the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.860 
years old it was quite expensive at the
time<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.849> developed<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.300> fault<00:00:12.599> right

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
time and it developed the fault right

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480 
time and it developed the fault right
now<00:00:13.080> which<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.830> won't<00:00:13.980> pick<00:00:14.160> up<00:00:14.309> any

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
now which is it won't pick up any

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.640 
now which is it won't pick up any
Freeview<00:00:15.059> channels<00:00:15.540> doesn't<00:00:16.410> matter<00:00:16.529> how

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
Freeview channels doesn't matter how

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.170 
Freeview channels doesn't matter how
many<00:00:16.800> times<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.340> scan<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.060> won't

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
many times you scan it it just won't

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.630 
many times you scan it it just won't
pick<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.449> any<00:00:18.690> channels<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:20.100> I've<00:00:20.340> been<00:00:20.490> online

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
pick up any channels so I've been online

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.670 
pick up any channels so I've been online
myself<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> some<00:00:22.230> other<00:00:22.289> people<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.619> had

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
myself and some other people have had

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.529 
myself and some other people have had
the<00:00:22.859> similar<00:00:23.100> sort<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> problem<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.330> we'll<00:00:24.449> be

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the similar sort of problem and we'll be

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.400 
the similar sort of problem and we'll be
wrecking<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:26.210> capacitor<00:00:27.410> underneath

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
wrecking it is is capacitor underneath

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.820 
wrecking it is is capacitor underneath
the<00:00:28.560> circuit<00:00:28.980> board<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.500> here's<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> machine

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the circuit board so here's the machine

and<00:00:32.340> here's<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> circuit<00:00:33.329> board<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and here's the circuit board here so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
and here's the circuit board here so
undone<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> screws<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:38.989> we'll<00:00:39.989> lift

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
undone some of the screws and we'll lift

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
undone some of the screws and we'll lift
it<00:00:40.260> off<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:44.719> tab<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.730> comes<00:00:47.940> out

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it off the tab that one comes out

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.380 
it off the tab that one comes out
several<00:00:48.780> screws<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.390> some

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
several screws and now you can see some

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.810 
several screws and now you can see some
capacitors<00:00:51.989> underneath<00:00:53.480> apparently<00:00:54.480> um<00:00:55.820> this

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
capacitors underneath apparently um this

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
capacitors underneath apparently um this
one<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> main<00:00:57.750> fault<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.320> six<00:00:58.620> point

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
one here is the main fault a six point

one here is the main fault a six point
three<00:00:58.980> volt<00:00:59.520> capacitor<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.219> also<00:01:02.219> there's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
three volt capacitor and also there's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
three volt capacitor and also there's
another<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.910> alongside<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.019> going

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
another one alongside it which I'm going

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.480 
another one alongside it which I'm going
to<00:01:04.260> change<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.650> well<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.860> think<00:01:07.010> been<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.130> eBay

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to change as well I think been on eBay

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to change as well I think been on eBay
your<00:01:08.880> capacitors<00:01:10.820> there's<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> replacement

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
your capacitors there's the replacement

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.330 
your capacitors there's the replacement
it's<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:13.760> thirty<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:14.850> forty<00:01:15.150> pH<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> can

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's about thirty or forty pH so you can

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
it's about thirty or forty pH so you can
see<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> top<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:17.970> apparently

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
see on the top here apparently

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.370 
see on the top here apparently
this<00:01:19.380> one's<00:01:19.590> completely<00:01:19.890> flat<00:01:20.420> whereas<00:01:21.420> my

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
this one's completely flat whereas my

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.130 
this one's completely flat whereas my
suspect<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> slightly<00:01:24.420> domed<00:01:24.780> on

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
suspect one here is slightly domed on

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.109 
suspect one here is slightly domed on
the<00:01:25.259> top<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.070> sometimes<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.820> sort<00:01:27.060> of

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the top and sometimes there go sort of

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.999 
the top and sometimes there go sort of
an<00:01:27.270> orangey<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.810> black<00:01:28.229> color<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> top

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
an orangey or black color on the top

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.550 
an orangey or black color on the top
which<00:01:29.790> shows<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> they've<00:01:30.360> blown<00:01:30.600> me<00:01:31.290> mark

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
which shows that they've blown me mark

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
which shows that they've blown me mark
this<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.070> can't<00:01:32.400> definitely<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
this one here can't definitely see it's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200 
this one here can't definitely see it's
blown<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> does<00:01:33.900> feel<00:01:34.670> like<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.970> say

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
blown but it does feel like I say

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
blown but it does feel like I say
billowed<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.810> top<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> say<00:01:39.900> I've<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.439> one

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
billowed on top so say I've got this one

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.260 
billowed on top so say I've got this one
and<00:01:40.829> I've<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.369> couple<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> other<00:01:41.850> smaller

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and I've got a couple of other smaller

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710 
and I've got a couple of other smaller
capacitor<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.350> replace<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.720> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
capacitor here to replace that one so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
capacitor here to replace that one so
what<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.220> strip

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
what I'm going to do now is just strip

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.660 
what I'm going to do now is just strip
the<00:01:48.030> whole<00:01:48.240> carcass<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.460> get<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the whole carcass down and get to the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.630 
the whole carcass down and get to the
back<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.060> those<00:01:51.210> capacitors<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.520> solder<00:01:53.520> them

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
back of those capacitors to solder them

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
back of those capacitors to solder them
in<00:01:54.259> obviously<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> fiddly<00:01:55.950> job

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
in obviously it's a bit of a fiddly job

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.910 
in obviously it's a bit of a fiddly job
so<00:01:56.460> um<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.600> capacitor<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.170> running<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.560> two

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so um the capacitor is running about two

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.679 
so um the capacitor is running about two
couple<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> quid<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.850> ended<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.509> spending

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
couple of quid but ended up spending

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.260 
couple of quid but ended up spending
fifteen<00:02:01.170> quid<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.469> them<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.009> headlamp<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
fifteen quid on them a headlamp or a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
fifteen quid on them a headlamp or a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
magnifying head-head visor to actually

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.010 
magnifying head-head visor to actually
put<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.030> you've<00:02:06.540> got<00:02:06.689> all<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.930> different

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
put it in you've got all your different

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.440 
and then for doing here doing any work
like<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:13.480> magnifies<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.060> you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
like this it magnifies like that you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.089 
like this it magnifies like that you
choose<00:02:16.689> all<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.959> different<00:02:17.230> magnifications

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
choose all you different magnifications

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.789 
choose all you different magnifications
and<00:02:18.430> then<00:02:18.579> you<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:18.939> able<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.260> solder<00:02:20.260> with<00:02:20.470> them

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
and then you be able to solder with them

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.640 
and then you be able to solder with them
you<00:02:21.430> know<00:02:21.549> with<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.269> lot<00:02:22.840> more<00:02:23.019> faith<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.290> with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
you know with a lot more faith in with

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.020 
you know with a lot more faith in with
the<00:02:23.739> human<00:02:24.069> eye<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.430> next<00:02:30.610> thing<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.849> do

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the human eye so the next thing to do

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.000 
the human eye so the next thing to do
after<00:02:31.269> you've<00:02:31.420> removed<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.409> circuit<00:02:32.799> board

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
after you've removed that circuit board

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.710 
after you've removed that circuit board
is<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.549> remove<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.879> hard<00:02:34.090> drive<00:02:34.180> there's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
is then to remove the hard drive there's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.479 
is then to remove the hard drive there's
four<00:02:35.230> screws<00:02:36.000> there<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.390> then<00:02:41.370> second<00:02:42.370> thing

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
four screws there and then second thing

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.309 
four screws there and then second thing
to<00:02:42.579> do<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.030> take<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.390> actual<00:02:43.599> fascia<00:02:43.989> panel

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
to do is to take the actual fascia panel

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.020 
to do is to take the actual fascia panel
off<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.340> that's<00:02:45.609> just<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.940> series<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.329> Clips

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
off and that's just a series of Clips

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.509 
off and that's just a series of Clips
around<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.150> side<00:02:49.389> and<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:50.230> slides<00:02:50.590> off

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.979 

right<00:02:57.519> next<00:02:57.940> thing<00:02:58.180> after<00:02:58.329> that<00:02:58.659> is<00:02:58.840> I've

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
right next thing after that is I've

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.140 
right next thing after that is I've
taken<00:02:59.200> out<00:02:59.409> the<00:03:00.720> DVD<00:03:01.720> Drive<00:03:02.790> next<00:03:03.790> had<00:03:04.030> to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
taken out the DVD Drive next had to

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.530 
taken out the DVD Drive next had to
loosen<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:05.129> panel<00:03:06.129> there<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.609> then<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.389> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
loosen this panel there and then all the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.930 
loosen this panel there and then all the
screws<00:03:07.810> along<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.109> back<00:03:08.409> and<00:03:08.709> there<00:03:09.459> we<00:03:09.819> are

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
screws along the back and there we are

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.460 
screws along the back and there we are
eventually<00:03:11.040> wherever<00:03:12.040> we<00:03:12.099> want<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:13.470> which

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
eventually wherever we want to be which

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.740 
eventually wherever we want to be which
is<00:03:14.620> basically<00:03:14.919> the<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.879> back<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.329> circuit

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
is basically the the back of the circuit

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.020 
is basically the the back of the circuit
board<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.299> identify<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.760> couple<00:03:21.760> of

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
board and then to identify a couple of

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.689 
board and then to identify a couple of
terminals<00:03:22.269> down<00:03:22.810> here<00:03:23.109> somewhere<00:03:23.639> which<00:03:24.639> is

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
terminals down here somewhere which is

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.830 
terminals down here somewhere which is
the<00:03:24.970> ones<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.299> need<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.629> re<00:03:25.780> solder<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:28.090> as<00:03:28.660> you

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
the ones I need to re solder so as you

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.069 
the ones I need to re solder so as you
can<00:03:28.900> see<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.349> really<00:03:29.560> quite<00:03:29.919> a<00:03:30.599> small<00:03:31.599> area

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
can see it's really quite a small area

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.369 
can see it's really quite a small area
to<00:03:32.290> solder<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:34.980> hence<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:37.419> goggles<00:03:38.290> are

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
to solder so hence the the goggles are

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.680 
to solder so hence the the goggles are
going<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.560> really<00:03:38.709> come<00:03:38.919> in<00:03:39.010> handy<00:03:39.040> there

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
going to really come in handy there

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170 
going to really come in handy there
right<00:03:40.690> next<00:03:41.260> thing<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.620> do<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:43.000> all<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
right next thing to do get all the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.059 
right next thing to do get all the
soldering<00:03:43.599> ready<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:47.079> this<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.500> capacitor

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
soldering ready so this is the capacitor

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.559 
soldering ready so this is the capacitor
I'm<00:03:48.160> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> change<00:03:48.669> and<00:03:48.970> I'm<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:49.329> used

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
I'm going to change and I'm just used

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.509 
I'm going to change and I'm just used
one<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.780> these<00:03:49.870> lenses<00:03:50.349> over<00:03:50.680> me<00:03:50.829> iPhone<00:03:51.250> and

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
one of these lenses over me iPhone and

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.129 
one of these lenses over me iPhone and
it's<00:03:51.639> magnified<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.329> up<00:03:52.449> lovely<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.019> can

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
it's magnified it up lovely as you can

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.210 
it's magnified it up lovely as you can
see

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
see

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.439 
see
so<00:03:54.519> what's<00:03:54.699> handy<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.150> they're

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
so what's handy is that they're

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.649 
so what's handy is that they're
identified<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.500> one<00:03:56.680> c1<00:03:57.239> five<00:03:58.239> double

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
identified like this one c1 five double

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.619 
identified like this one c1 five double
three<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.069> other<00:04:00.190> number<00:04:00.489> for<00:04:01.419> the<00:04:01.510> other

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
three and the other number for the other

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.080 
three and the other number for the other
one<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.139> when<00:04:02.349> you<00:04:02.440> turn<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.829> over<00:04:02.949> and<00:04:03.430> look<00:04:04.000> at

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
one so when you turn it over and look at

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.930 
one so when you turn it over and look at
the<00:04:04.150> other<00:04:04.269> side<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.599> can<00:04:04.840> then<00:04:05.079> identify

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the other side you can then identify

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.159 
the other side you can then identify
exactly<00:04:06.940> where<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.329> is<00:04:07.479> because<00:04:07.750> believe<00:04:08.139> me

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
exactly where it is because believe me

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:17.780 
exactly where it is because believe me
it's<00:04:09.720> minut<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:11.319> see

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.470 

all<00:04:18.790> right<00:04:18.940> let's<00:04:19.480> get<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.660> soldier<00:04:20.079> in<00:04:20.170> Iraq<00:04:21.480> so

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
all right let's get a soldier in Iraq so

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.220 
all right let's get a soldier in Iraq so
remove<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.290> one<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.100> capacitors<00:04:24.730> here

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
remove the one of the capacitors here

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.750 
remove the one of the capacitors here
and<00:04:26.230> I've<00:04:26.440> got<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.650> new<00:04:26.890> one<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.160> put<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.460> back<00:04:27.550> in

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
and I've got a new one to put it back in

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.620 
and I've got a new one to put it back in
place<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:28.590> way<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.650> identify<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:31.030> capacity<00:04:31.600> of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
place a way to identify the capacity of

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.080 
place a way to identify the capacity of
positive<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.200> negative<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.880> couple<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:33.970> ways

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
positive and negative a couple of ways

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.360 
positive and negative a couple of ways
really<00:04:34.330> one<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.140> got<00:04:35.290> a<00:04:35.320> negative<00:04:35.830> sign

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
really one it's got a negative sign

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.000 
really one it's got a negative sign
right<00:04:36.400> here<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:38.110> other<00:04:38.230> way<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.620> that

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
right here and the other way is that

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.250 
right here and the other way is that
negative<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.030> usually<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.420> short<00:04:40.810> one<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.080> the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
negative is usually the short one of the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.330 
negative is usually the short one of the
two<00:04:41.910> what<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.000> got<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.210> do<00:04:43.330> now<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:44.100> 1010<00:04:45.100> this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
two what I got to do now is 1010 this

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.510 
two what I got to do now is 1010 this
sum<00:04:45.640> these<00:04:46.180> prongs<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.900> then<00:04:47.410> they'll<00:04:47.590> bond

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
sum these prongs and then they'll bond

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.570 
sum these prongs and then they'll bond
nicely<00:04:49.000> into<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.470> into<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.590> circuit<00:04:51.400> board

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
nicely into the into the circuit board

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.170 
nicely into the into the circuit board
so<00:04:55.290> 10<00:04:56.290> is<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:56.650> adding<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.340> small<00:04:57.670> amount<00:04:58.000> of

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
so 10 is just adding a small amount of

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:07.550 
so 10 is just adding a small amount of
solar<00:04:58.390> activity<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.800> wires<00:05:01.740> like<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:03.100> I

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
so just sold them on now just going to

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:49.330 
so just sold them on now just going to
trim<00:05:40.220> off<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.720> tails<00:05:48.099> all<00:05:49.099> right

reassembling a whole unit which
unfortunately<00:06:06.440> I<00:06:06.650> took<00:06:07.039> apart<00:06:07.520> about<00:06:07.610> a<00:06:07.789> week

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
unfortunately I took apart about a week

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.870 
unfortunately I took apart about a week
ago<00:06:11.889> I'll<00:06:12.889> see<00:06:13.069> how<00:06:13.130> many<00:06:13.310> screws<00:06:13.580> I've<00:06:13.729> got

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
ago I'll see how many screws I've got

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.120 
ago I'll see how many screws I've got
left<00:06:14.030> after<00:06:14.240> this<00:06:17.349> right<00:06:18.349> so<00:06:18.590> that's<00:06:18.710> it<00:06:18.919> put

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
left after this right so that's it put

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.510 
left after this right so that's it put
it<00:06:19.190> all<00:06:19.280> back<00:06:19.400> together<00:06:19.550> now<00:06:20.419> take<00:06:20.900> it<00:06:21.020> inside

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
it all back together now take it inside

it all back together now take it inside
wired<00:06:22.520> up<00:06:22.699> and<00:06:23.210> see<00:06:23.599> if<00:06:23.690> that's<00:06:23.870> fixed<00:06:24.229> it

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
wired up and see if that's fixed it

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.219 
wired up and see if that's fixed it
there's<00:06:25.940> all<00:06:26.120> my<00:06:26.240> stuff<00:06:26.479> on<00:06:26.599> the<00:06:26.720> hard<00:06:26.930> drive

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
there's all my stuff on the hard drive

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:33.129 
there's all my stuff on the hard drive
just<00:06:28.300> haven't<00:06:29.300> got<00:06:29.659> a<00:06:30.340> lot<00:06:31.340> channels<00:06:31.900> right<00:06:32.900> no

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
just haven't got a lot channels right no

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.430 
just haven't got a lot channels right no
channel<00:06:33.500> so<00:06:33.680> let's<00:06:33.710> see<00:06:33.979> if<00:06:34.039> we<00:06:34.159> can<00:06:35.139> go<00:06:36.139> to<00:06:36.199> the

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
channel so let's see if we can go to the

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.360 
channel so let's see if we can go to the
settings<00:06:37.630> and<00:06:38.630> see<00:06:38.960> if<00:06:39.050> it<00:06:39.320> will<00:06:39.560> now<00:06:39.969> pick<00:06:40.969> up

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
settings and see if it will now pick up

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.589 
settings and see if it will now pick up
the<00:06:43.370> other<00:06:43.960> three<00:06:44.960> view<00:06:45.259> channels<00:06:46.210> see<00:06:47.210> if<00:06:47.300> all

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
the other three view channels see if all

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.409 
the other three view channels see if all
this<00:06:47.750> has<00:06:47.960> been<00:06:48.139> worth<00:06:48.320> it<00:06:48.530> auto<00:06:48.770> reset<00:06:49.430> let's

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
this has been worth it auto reset let's

00:06:50.419 --> 00:07:07.260 
this has been worth it auto reset let's
go<00:06:50.659> for<00:06:50.900> it

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.189 

oh<00:07:07.300> yes<00:07:08.289> here<00:07:09.190> we<00:07:09.280> go<00:07:09.550> it's<00:07:10.300> now<00:07:10.509> selecting<00:07:11.080> all

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
oh yes here we go it's now selecting all

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:19.670 
oh yes here we go it's now selecting all
the<00:07:11.229> channels<00:07:15.810> nice<00:07:16.810> one

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.909 

there<00:07:20.680> you<00:07:20.740> go<00:07:20.889> up<00:07:21.130> and<00:07:21.310> down<00:07:21.460> the<00:07:21.550> channels

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.550
