can trade them all and they will all
trace<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:10.680> army<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
trace you so you can have an army of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.490 
trace you so you can have an army of
bots<00:01:11.430> chasing<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.210> which<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.320> pretty

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
bots chasing you around which is pretty

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.600 
bots chasing you around which is pretty
funny<00:01:13.909> I'm<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.750> entirely<00:01:16.229> sure<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.619> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
funny I'm not entirely sure if it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.929 
funny I'm not entirely sure if it's
possible<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.450> anything<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:19.170> these

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
possible to get anything from these

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
possible to get anything from these
because<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> soft<00:01:21.570> rewards<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
because a lot of soft rewards go in the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.789 
because a lot of soft rewards go in the
bank<00:01:23.060> but<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.270> quite<00:01:24.630> fun<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.200> uh<00:01:27.259> yeah<00:01:28.259> so

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
bank but it's quite fun to do uh yeah so

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.740 
bank but it's quite fun to do uh yeah so
I'm<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.400> sure<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.880> that'll<00:01:30.509> work

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
I'm not really sure how that'll work

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
I'm not really sure how that'll work
with<00:01:30.960> cash<00:01:31.200> bags<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
with cash bags now I'm not sure if the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.969 
with cash bags now I'm not sure if the
cash<00:01:32.640> bags<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.150> drop<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.500> floor<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
cash bags will drop on the floor and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.850 
cash bags will drop on the floor and
give<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.430> what's<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> cash<00:01:36.240> bag<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.869> what

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
give you what's in the cash bag or what

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.880 
give you what's in the cash bag or what
but<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:39.000> initiative<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.890> stop

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but I think it's an initiative to stop

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.270 
but I think it's an initiative to stop
square<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> fortune<00:01:41.759> bots<00:01:42.060> being<00:01:42.390> made<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
square the fortune bots being made and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.039 
square the fortune bots being made and
abused<00:01:44.689> but<00:01:45.799> basically<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:48.049> you

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
they'll get bored and trying home telly

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.930 
they'll get bored and trying home telly
and<00:02:22.650> once<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.100> them<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.370> vines<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and once you get them to the vines the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.430 
and once you get them to the vines the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
if you trade them and walk it a couple

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.890 
if you trade them and walk it a couple
squares<00:02:29.370> anyway<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.090> case<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.450> logs<00:02:30.660> out

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
squares anyway just in case it logs out

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.460 
squares anyway just in case it logs out
because<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.370> inactivity<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.700> whatever

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
because of inactivity or whatever

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.720
