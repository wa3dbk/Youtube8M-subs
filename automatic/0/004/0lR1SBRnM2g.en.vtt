00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
on your talent and I think people who

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.909 
on your talent and I think people who
were<00:04:43.389> real<00:04:43.660> actors<00:04:44.110> have<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.500> get<00:04:44.620> out<00:04:44.740> there

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
were real actors have to get out there

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.500 
were real actors have to get out there
and<00:04:45.070> hone<00:04:45.190> their<00:04:45.400> craft<00:04:45.430> still<00:04:45.970> it's

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
and hone their craft still it's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.090 
and hone their craft still it's
different<00:04:46.990> from<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.230> theater<00:04:47.620> if<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:47.950> grow

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
different from the theater if you grow

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.070 
different from the theater if you grow
up<00:04:48.220> in<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.430> theater<00:04:48.840> moviemaking<00:04:49.840> is

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
up in the theater moviemaking is

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.720 
up in the theater moviemaking is
different<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.530> terms<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.400> have<00:04:51.640> to

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
different in terms of that you have to

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.880 
different in terms of that you have to
learn<00:04:51.850> how<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.060> work<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.510> camera<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.169> and<00:04:53.350> and

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
learn how to work to camera and and and

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.040 
learn how to work to camera and and and
perform<00:04:54.280> in<00:04:54.400> front<00:04:54.430> of<00:04:54.700> crews<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.480> there's<00:04:55.960> a

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
perform in front of crews and there's a

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.900 
perform in front of crews and there's a
certain<00:04:56.320> technique<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:57.340> has<00:04:57.520> to<00:04:57.669> be<00:04:57.760> learned

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
certain technique that has to be learned

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.970 
certain technique that has to be learned
so<00:04:58.919> I<00:05:00.030> feel<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.390> somehow<00:05:02.290> made<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.800> right

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
so I feel that I somehow made the right

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.730 
so I feel that I somehow made the right
choice<00:05:03.250> although<00:05:04.050> I've<00:05:05.050> never<00:05:05.290> been<00:05:05.500> in<00:05:05.620> a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
choice although I've never been in a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.670 
choice although I've never been in a
