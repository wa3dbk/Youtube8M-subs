a thin cotton run and following the
lines<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.149> created<00:01:23.149> when<00:01:24.149> I<00:01:24.179> was<00:01:24.390> making<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
lines are created when I was making the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.820 
lines are created when I was making the
mist<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> front<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.750> makes<00:01:27.990> next<00:01:28.619> life

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
mist on the front so it makes next life

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.410 
mist on the front so it makes next life
easier

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.160 

and<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.170> mist<00:01:33.409> wants<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.490> sort<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:35.060> zigzag<00:01:35.390> up

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
and the mist wants to sort of zigzag up

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.980 
and the mist wants to sort of zigzag up
and<00:01:37.070> they<00:01:37.430> they<00:01:37.820> say<00:01:38.060> it's<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.240> dragon's

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
and they they say it's the dragon's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:53.920 
and they they say it's the dragon's
breath

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.909 

so<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.080> that's<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.460> now
