00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.220
 I miss you 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.830
 When Jerry grew up 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.970
 Tom was no longer in this world 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.410
 Tom 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 When you know that the end of his life is coming up just around the corner 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 Secretly disappeared from the front of Jerry 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.850
 In front of Jerry 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.079
 The I did not want to show myself that became brittle tears weak 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.030
 Tom 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.030
 In Jerry's heart I wanted to stay alive as a partner 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.110
 When I noticed that Tom was gone 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.190
 Jerry did not feel sad 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:55.879
 I thought it would be boring 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.879
 Because fight with Tom was the game with the most thrill 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.670
 I wonder why the back of my heart is scratching 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.670
 Jerry didn't really know what that was 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.920
 As Tom wishes 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.770
 In the mind of Jerry 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.770
 Tom always had a bad dog 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.050
 One day 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:26.870
 A cat appeared before Jerry 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.870
 It is a cat whose body is smaller than Tom 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.030
 Jerry, who was lonely because she had no dog rotation friend 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:42.119
 I thought that Gondo would put this cat in perspective 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.130
 So Jerry uses the mousetrap with a holed triangular cheese to make that cat 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 We decided to make a name 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.990
 As always with Tom 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.930
 Jerry hides behind and seeks for a mouse, waiting for the cat to come near the mousetrap 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.360
 The 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.710
 And speculation street cat is approaching toward the trap 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.860
 Jerry thought it was tight 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.850
 As usual, I pretend that I am caught in a mouse catch, and on the contrary, I caught a cat on a mouse 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.050
 Do it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.830
 f 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.370
 The figure that jumps across the tail or tail floats on the head 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.370
 It is pleasant 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.970
 But 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 The cat is not Tom 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.739
 When a cat comes close to cheese 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 Notice the smell of a rat that looks delicious before Jerry appears 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:47.230
 It has been attacked Jerry had been hidden by the lightning speed to the eye 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:54.659
 Jerry was always home as Tom was running away 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.659
 I was caught soon after a sound that was supposed to be slower than Tom, and my body was bitten with debris 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.930
 Jerry bites back, but the cat should be smaller than Tom 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.930
 I'm going 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.129
 Milk covered Jerry 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.129
 In the sense of fading 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.290
 Actually 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.970
 That the rat can not beat the cat and can not win 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.980
 Always Tom 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.890
 Pretending to be done to Jerry 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.840
 That I did not catch Jerry on purpose 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.840
 I knew for the first time that time 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.220
 I noticed Tom's great kindness and friendship 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:46.549
 And 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.549
 Fly, but I noticed also in many of the tingling of the identity of the breast at the time of gone 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.700
 I lost my irreplaceable friend 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.700
 I was sad 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.519
 When Jerry's soul leaves the body 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.680
 A gentle smile on the sky 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.680
 There was Tom waiting for Jerry 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.610
 You can fight again 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.660
 Nasum Takamasa 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.560
 Of stronger yuan 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.560
 I'll catch you 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.240
 Tom and Jerry 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.490
 Do you such selfishness fight
