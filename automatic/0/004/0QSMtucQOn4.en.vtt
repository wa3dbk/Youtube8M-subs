00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
galacticraft mars as well as just the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670

the<00:01:17.310> tier<00:01:18.000> 2<00:01:18.030> i<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.290> is

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the tier 2 i think it is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.240 
the tier 2 i think it is
Sarris<00:01:21.270> being<00:01:21.510> quite<00:01:21.750> slow<00:01:22.050> using<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.010> tier<00:01:23.220> 2

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
Sarris being quite slow using the tier 2

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.420 
Sarris being quite slow using the tier 2
rocket<00:01:23.910> maybe<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.300> slowed<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.870> up<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.230> so<00:01:26.220> here

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
rocket maybe I slowed it up now so here

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.450 
rocket maybe I slowed it up now so here
