00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 the ball that generated such chances if the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.350
 problem was in that last touch 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.360
 on the one hand and on the very good response 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.679
 of the bowler bonilla on the other without 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 No doubt I think that the position of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.870
 ball the day of Peru was always more bull 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 in the Colombian countryside I think the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 first time that many years that I see that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.300
 a Colombian team does not have the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.670
 position ball and topped with equipment 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.560
 Peruvian and did not combine in the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 options is not the the criminal plays for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.609
 they leave me some doubts because I 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 It seems that Gomez turns 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.700
 chávez chávez pardon chávez and the lack 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.520
 criminal not well executed this for me is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.320
 a super important player in colombia 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.930
 this number 10 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.700
 Quintero is the creative one in which he makes 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 pauses but today I think it was 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.920
 overcome by the collective of Peru and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.500
 but has then again through the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.239
 Daniel says that as appears 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.160
 bonilla bowler when Colombian had 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.620
 the ball and the resources of Peru were 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.020
 with danger towards the arch of Colombia 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.630
 appeared the bowler bonilla with taking out 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.400
 I think four situations of goal 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.980
 in the first type of times he pulls 3 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.380
 another one of the archer is also that 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.960
 I think the man who tried 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 hit him at the far post and is in lorraine 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 These are pictures of the first 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 7 times are cuatiá gómez which aragüás 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.240
 of clear goals 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.770
 the archer again the archer 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.510
 only among the prawns does it seem 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 we say good for a cassock to come 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.860
 that the archer and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.440
 then it ends up saving the post not and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.870
 this is very good also on the end 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.330
 of the first 45 minutes with a 9 is 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.160
 fighter fighter this cordoba in times 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.869
 which is the reference of them of the team 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.490
 Colombian when he has no resources 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.470
 colombia hits a long ball so that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.119
 córdoba pelee and this is a picture the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 second time but he used a clear 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.950
 dominator I think we beat him 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.280
 always the rebound is very clear that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.430
 have a look and the hand of the archer is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.560
 a hand is polo in a quick resource 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.240
 that ends up hitting him and the goalie very 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.830
 well and it 's ears flowers has it 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.080
 left but static in which is a 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.240
 puntazo is an important resource that 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.899
 has flowers like any player 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.550
 and then he had perea is the next 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.080
 they are the second time probably because 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.310
 are the hairdresser ends up pulling the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.130
 outside 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 and then Peru as always dominating and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260
 this is inostroza nobel took into account 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.300
 a bounce nothing to do for the goalkeeper 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.470
 and ends up saving the crossbar 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.270
 Colombian team was getting into the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.099
 archer's angle had already done the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.590
 effort had not come a ball 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.959
 well open that would be the best 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.959
 possibility but sometimes the clubs do not 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.610
 today they were more than ever already 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.360
 coldly it has to be said that the sticks 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.280
 they are like that so it is that ball 9 enter is not 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.190
 what we have done we have done in 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.140
 other places there is this moral analysis 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.670
 of the match in the moral result remains 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.380
 Of course, it produces situations in Europe 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.910
 without any pains I'm not talking about 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.190
 a moral triumph I'm talking about 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.810
 a sequence but this one serves but in the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 result that is worth in the one that gives the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 points where you have to see for a 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.260
 classification won colombia and colombia 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.340
 is fair in the world but in 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.410
 the analysis of the game 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.810
 it seems to me that Peru beyond the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.220
 results and beyond how it ends has 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.220
 proven to be a team
