00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.610
 Zoom in an official 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.740
 Greetings of God who publish with low probability 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.089
 Department stores of the city we want 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.129
 just go underground and get here 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.419
 I wanted to give a few photographs in the Munich subway 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.279
 only a very small amount of equipment 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.720
 50 millimeters 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.429
 Open Data of 1 4 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.109
 furthermore 15 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 I wanted to become a relatively Spartan house 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.510
 Of course, the dead is clearly over 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.140
 However, weighting in the present size of the lance that the Chancellor 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110
 some villages cities take a trip 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.330
 and 2 I got out of the insanely strong thus not with a premium of 1 and 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.600
 Peter Beuth that I also concede in terms of how it here in the squad 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.420
 been appointed 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.320
 Thereby reveal a very very good possibility gives outdoor without tripod 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.630
 to photograph these 50 millimeters are on the small picture of a normal 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.270
 Walsh and what does it mean normally? 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.030
 this is a focal length which is approximately the diagonal of the length 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.780
 Image sensor thus corresponds to me in the sound it is the image sensor 96 times 24th 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.500
 Millimeter big, the UN is called all PETA big so maybe by that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.720
 43 millimeters or so 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.250
 and that's why he said that one time the other technically 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.270
 a normal as well as deep is so 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.730
 Ryan from the picture impression between a wide angle and a team of 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.160
 you benefit from it once again while waiting the world as they represent that 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.149
 human eye sees 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.989
 but is true that number 2 in the German men's teams plastic image 

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.390
 the reason the and delivers 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.750
 Of course, the whole thing will be a bit different from his point of view 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.640
 to leave personal photographer euro-zone 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.590
 normally but certainly very very much objective honestly say at least 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.430
 which, so to speak, each focal length range double and triple 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.010
 cover and sometimes that's just its charm I just think of one 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.680
 Fixed focal length they take pictures with a fixed focal length 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.180
 and Paulson forget about personal experience 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.430
 according to other reports 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.330
 the subway station takes its new place 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.350
 Photographers Eldorado is very very saturated and blue and brown for him 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.829
 Styling tiled so 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.299
 also the complementary Comcast blue-orange very well usable and then 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.149
 Again and again these lines applies, for example, this ceiling lighting 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:16.139
 or flow through profits if she can photograph very nicely 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.689
 All in all, it hurts very much every year 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.569
 what looks like they were built to be photographed 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.569
 the stationing of the MÃ¼nchner Freiheit is also very nice here 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.519
 redesigned three years ago, he agrees that the living blue 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.430
 and there too 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.809
 very many photo opportunities 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.029
 so if you have the opportunity to photograph old people then look 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.229
 you definitely still 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.579
 b I want to drive downtown again and 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.319
 Munich continues culinary 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.769
 up soon
