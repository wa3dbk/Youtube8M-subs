the wall we come close to the scene of

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.650 
the wall we come close to the scene of
where<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.470> shows<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.920> new<00:02:25.040> animatronic<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
where it shows the new animatronic it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.770 
where it shows the new animatronic it
switching<00:02:27.489> seeing<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.579> it's<00:02:28.760> powering<00:02:29.540> up

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
switching seeing that it's powering up

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.610 
switching seeing that it's powering up
or<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.260> waiting<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.459> activated

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
or just waiting to be activated

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890 
or just waiting to be activated
something<00:02:33.620> along<00:02:34.130> those<00:02:34.370> lines

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
something along those lines

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.860 
something along those lines
or<00:02:36.409> so<00:02:36.769> we<00:02:36.799> thought<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:39.110> game's<00:02:39.439> trailer<00:02:40.159> is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
or so we thought the game's trailer is

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.309 
or so we thought the game's trailer is
actually<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.049> foreshadow<00:02:44.019> allow<00:02:45.019> me<00:02:45.200> to

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
actually a foreshadow allow me to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.569 
actually a foreshadow allow me to
