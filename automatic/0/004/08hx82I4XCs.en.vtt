wire I had a really crummy pair so this

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.860 
wire I had a really crummy pair so this
took<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.780> little<00:01:59.410> bit<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.890> trim<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.280> wire<00:02:00.460> down

you<00:02:59.440> have<00:02:59.560> done<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.130> should<00:03:00.310> have

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
you have done that you should have

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.670 
you have done that you should have
triangles<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.209> are<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.720> same<00:03:01.989> size<00:03:02.320> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
triangles that are the same size and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.220 
triangles that are the same size and
shape<00:03:03.180> taking<00:03:04.180> your<00:03:04.300> finger<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:04.690> lightly

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
shape taking your finger just lightly

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.350 
shape taking your finger just lightly
tapping<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.950> edges<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.489> round<00:03:06.730> them<00:03:06.910> off<00:03:07.090> so

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
tapping the edges to round them off so

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.870 
tapping the edges to round them off so
that<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.630> doesn't<00:03:07.930> look<00:03:08.080> as<00:03:08.260> sharp<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.130> this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
that it doesn't look as sharp and this

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.910 
that it doesn't look as sharp and this
is<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.180> difference<00:03:10.570> between<00:03:10.709> before<00:03:11.709> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
is the difference between before and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.640 
is the difference between before and
after<00:03:12.220> what<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.700> should<00:03:12.880> look<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:14.470> your

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
after what it should look like with your

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.650 
after what it should look like with your
pastel<00:03:15.070> green<00:03:15.310> piece<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.700> clay<00:03:15.880> take<00:03:16.480> your

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
slice and slice to pieces that are the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.420 
slice and slice to pieces that are the
same<00:03:24.549> length<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.209> your<00:03:25.450> watermelon<00:03:25.989> slice

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
same length as your watermelon slice

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.009 
same length as your watermelon slice
taking<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.580> piece<00:03:27.850> you're<00:03:28.239> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.720> mash

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
taking that piece you're going to mash

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.229 
taking that piece you're going to mash
into<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.650> top<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.160> when<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.400> say<00:03:30.640> mash<00:03:30.880> just

of the part of the watermelon you want
to<00:03:38.019> cover<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.860> use<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.250> second<00:03:39.610> piece<00:03:39.790> as

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
to cover you can use a second piece as

to cover you can use a second piece as
well<00:03:40.209> don't<00:03:40.930> worry<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.440> doesn't<00:03:41.470> have<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.100> be

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
well don't worry it doesn't have to be

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.070 
well don't worry it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:03:42.670> because<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.390> just<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.870> one

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
perfect because this is just the one

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.900 
perfect because this is just the one
part<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.560> rind

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
part of the rind

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.360 
part of the rind
same<00:03:46.390> exact<00:03:46.780> steps<00:03:47.110> with<00:03:47.350> your<00:03:47.590> dark<00:03:47.980> color

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
same exact steps with your dark color

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.300 
same exact steps with your dark color
green<00:03:48.730> clay<00:03:49.060> press<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.080> on<00:03:50.230> top<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.130> light

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
green clay press it on top of the light

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.760 
green clay press it on top of the light
passed<00:03:51.610> out<00:03:51.880> color<00:03:52.210> and<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.990> is<00:03:53.140> going<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.440> be

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
passed out color and this is going to be

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.040 
passed out color and this is going to be
the<00:03:54.010> outer<00:03:54.250> half<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.090> watermelon<00:03:55.420> because

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the outer half of the watermelon because

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.290 
the outer half of the watermelon because
the<00:03:56.260> rind<00:03:56.530> technically<00:03:57.340> isn't<00:03:57.550> just<00:03:58.030> one

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
the rind technically isn't just one

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.690 
the rind technically isn't just one
solid<00:03:58.600> color<00:03:59.020> so<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.620> decided<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.160> try<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.580> make

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
solid color so I decided to try and make

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.520 
solid color so I decided to try and make
this<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:00.910> little<00:04:01.180> bit<00:04:01.390> more<00:04:01.600> realistic<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.290> for

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
this a little bit more realistic and for

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.350 
this a little bit more realistic and for
any<00:04:02.710> rough<00:04:02.950> edges<00:04:03.190> just<00:04:03.610> use<00:04:03.820> your<00:04:04.030> finger<00:04:04.300> to

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
any rough edges just use your finger to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.050 
any rough edges just use your finger to
lightly<00:04:04.720> smooth<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.350> out<00:04:05.520> now<00:04:06.520> I'm<00:04:06.670> taking<00:04:07.030> my

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
lightly smooth it out now I'm taking my

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.420 
lightly smooth it out now I'm taking my
exacto<00:04:07.690> knife<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.050> trimming<00:04:08.410> off<00:04:08.530> any<00:04:08.740> goofy

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
exacto knife and trimming off any goofy

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.240 
exacto knife and trimming off any goofy
edges<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.090> kind<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.510> look<00:04:10.720> funky<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.470> making

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
edges that kind of look funky and making

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.580 
edges that kind of look funky and making
it<00:04:12.340> nice<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:12.730> clean<00:04:12.970> again<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.380> what

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
it nice and clean again and this is what

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.260 
it nice and clean again and this is what
they<00:04:17.860> should<00:04:18.100> look<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:18.340> now<00:04:18.730> they're<00:04:19.060> ready
