00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
excited about this one because a lot of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
excited about this one because a lot of
trigger<00:01:19.140> style<00:01:19.500> Capo's<00:01:20.040> they're<00:01:20.580> known<00:01:20.850> for

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
trigger style Capo's they're known for

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
trigger style Capo's they're known for
making<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:22.020> forcing<00:01:22.710> guitar<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
making your forcing guitar to go out of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
making your forcing guitar to go out of
tune<00:01:23.670> either<00:01:24.420> because<00:01:24.930> they're<00:01:25.110> clamping

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tune either because they're clamping

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
tune either because they're clamping
down<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:25.950> hard<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> tendency<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
down too hard or they have a tendency to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
down too hard or they have a tendency to
pull<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> string<00:01:28.320> sideways<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.250> raise<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
pull the string sideways that raise the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.270 
pull the string sideways that raise the
pitch<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.110> did<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.560> took<00:01:31.590> our<00:01:31.890> capo

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
pitch so what we did we took our capo

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920 
pitch so what we did we took our capo
and<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.729> actually<00:01:33.090> gave<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> adjustable

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and we actually gave it adjustable

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
and we actually gave it adjustable
tension<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.460> dial<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> amount<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
tension so you can dial in the amount of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
tension so you can dial in the amount of
pressure<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.290> dial<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.189> enough

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
pressure so you just dial in just enough

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.280 
pressure so you just dial in just enough
to<00:01:38.549> make<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> strings<00:01:39.060> ring<00:01:39.329> clear<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
to make the strings ring clear and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.870 
to make the strings ring clear and
that's<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.950> won't<00:01:41.159> make<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> guitar<00:01:41.759> go

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's it it won't make you a guitar go

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.080 
that's it it won't make you a guitar go
sharp<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:43.200> clamping<00:01:44.040> action<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.700> easy

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
sharp the clamping action is very easy

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.090 
sharp the clamping action is very easy
and<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.109> other<00:01:47.229> great<00:01:47.439> feature<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:47.979> that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100
