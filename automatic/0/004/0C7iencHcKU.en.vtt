 alessandro paulinho alex and emgatilhou 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.740
 slipped at the time of the shot 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.450
 leandro castÃ¡n the game is paralyzed 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.040
 Why are you asking for urgency in the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.130
 call now the seneme is from 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.130
 urgency 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.730
 to drop Alex in there and seems unconscious 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.170
 Look, Noriega will finish the game here. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 in the pacaembu and hope that it is not 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.160
 nothing serious with alex there that he can be 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.750
 promptly attended 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.190
 Second time the Saints was a beautiful 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.670
 second time the corinthians was better 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.170
 in the first stage could not translate 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.239
 already provided information that called 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.329
 ambulance not really all over spain 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.010
 who hit his head in a crash in the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.589
 head with the leg of the saints player 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.460
 is absolutely involuntary at the time 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.229
 of the knee 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.610
 when the steering wheel dropped and now the 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.489
 j drive so that the ambulance 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.140
 get on the lawn to remove Alex there 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.390
 a whole movement outside the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.380
 fourth referee came here to call the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.860
 ambulance to meet the alex and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.860
 all and all again 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.690
 the accident at work he is without 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.250
 his head is loose by movement 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.410
 it is still written and on the left side 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.130
 he goes against the knee is the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.950
 juice there hard having twisted really 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.510
 so that Alex can be well attended and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.700
 that's nothing serious 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.920
 Was with danilo 's the bid was like 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.230
 Damian's family is evidently much of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.540
 no blame right 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.340
 It's interesting that he was going to hit the goal 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.750
 No one ever said that they would 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.710
 to hit the goal there with a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.710
 slipping and went without support and then 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.040
 head went to a meeting of the knee of the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.040
 Danilo 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.750
 there the work of doctors and paramedics 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.970
 pronex people are watching the ball played 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.690
 by the side by side 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.840
 he arranged to hit the goal 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.630
 the support foot slides and in the fall 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.040
 shock of the head with the knee 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.040
 Sunday's left 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 and therefore the service to the player of the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.150
 corinthians 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.730
 we were just seconds from the cinema 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.370
 to terminate from here the payment 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.269
 total unhappiness now right from the player 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.310
 from corinthians 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:49.010
 alex our fans of course the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.010
 our positive vibrations there for 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.430
 nothing serious happens with alex is a 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.900
 excellent professional a great player 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 one of the great figures on the corner of the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.410
 corinthians
