00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.010
 Well, that's what he says about his braid flights 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.440
 I hope you all go very well 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.230
 and today management black ops 2 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.260
 for a search part destruction 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.370
 on the career map with a class 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.070
 fall without accessory five seven without 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.050
 accessory to all a bulletproof vest to 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.640
 all tomorrow leaves robustness to everything 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.010
 right to ester with tactical masks 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.489
 and the little topic today it will be the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.260
 pc so why the pc is everything 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.130
 just because I'm a player 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.680
 pc only pc i played a few 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.590
 portable consoles in my youth but 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.860
 good I really became a player 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.740
 on pc and if I talk about it today 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.210
 it's because pc since the year 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.149
 last all you him what that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.950
 comes back in force 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.979
 we come back in force because that makes 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.340
 a few years since since the release 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.530
 of the xbox 360 and the ps3 that we have 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.390
 regularly predicts PC death 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.520
 saying that it had become obsolete in 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.960
 video game that he was going to undergo 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.150
 competition from tablets and 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.939
 smartphones and that soon the pc soon 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.119
 we did not need it anymore and will you have 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.750
 everything wrong the pc it is there and it is in 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.350
 better condition than ever so why 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.540
 this renewed interest for the pc is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 simply because the consoles 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.920
 current home consoles 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.330
 I hear his old are end of life 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.250
 that she really drags the dough 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.470
 while the pc is still at the top 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.260
 and we realize again 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.050
 Hallelujah then 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.090
 one of the reasons the pc 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.870
 always remains at the top is that in terms 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.750
 of gameplay 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.340
 the pc is vastly more varied than the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.140
 consoles and there I was lucky that the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.120
 title does not see for more varied than 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.960
 the consoles except for a single genre to 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.280
 my sense the hadoken fighting games and 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.580
 still we can connect a controller on 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.610
 a pc plug a keyboard into a 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.380
 console of practically feasible then the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.160
 classic wargames and esther remain 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.650
 still the preserve of the pc games 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.550
 memos and the moba was also up 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.410
 a recent date 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.500
 I think especially a guardian for the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.110
 middle earth for mobiles 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.650
 so remained x 10 x qpc which shows 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.690
 well diversity and possibilities 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.280
 pc games as well as the ease of 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.370
 the use of the mouse keyboard by 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.110
 report to the controller 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.750
 if all and I was not out 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.220
 previously on console if it has 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.250
 time like for memos and moba 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.020
 it was necessary to adapt all 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.670
 the specifics of the little details that 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.709
 made a game easy and 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.500
 nice to use on pc is 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.739
 absolutely unplayable on consoles then 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.400
 on call of example there have been 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.590
 help with aiming 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.610
 that you players console you the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.690
 know all there is not on pc 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.420
 simply because we do not have 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.489
 need there is only the skill of the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.080
 player to successfully aim properly 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.209
 if you feel that 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.100
 I shoot really fast with my weapon 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.300
 because with a good mouse click you can 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.150
 reach gunfire rates 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.690
 impossible without my dusting on 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.610
 console what is rather what is 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.959
 rather one of the advantages of pc like you 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.940
 see I shoot really fast with the egg 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.489
 go really fast too with the five 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.130
 cbl then yet the majority of 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.420
 publishers scorn the pc and use it 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.580
 only as a showcase 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.019
 technological of the kind you saw how 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.340
 I have too much beautiful graphics because 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.709
 we can afford to afford 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.230
 super motor besides if you have 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.880
 noticed on my pc because the video 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.280
 wii so taking of my pc the game is 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.020
 super ugly because I have an old 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.160
 pc for here 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.660
 so the problem is that the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.820
 good minutes him like killzone or 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.290
 then is really the property of 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.940
 consoles and that's a shame because the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.220
 pc forgiveness machine is a machine 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.800
 beautiful which is certainly expensive to obtain 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.440
 with a lot of possibilities 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.850
 is sad to note that this 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.120
 machine the year considered that as a 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.320
 under console that's when that's where the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.980
 part will be ending soon as you 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.080
 see was already 14-0 we win 3-0 so 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.440
 teams and churches teammates the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.320
 enemies not being very smart must be well 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.610
 say it last word which for my part 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.410
 so it was the 15th 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.820
 I'm going then I'll rock at the spawn 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.170
 unfortunately the last enemies the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.980
 last two the enemy staying here 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.870
 was no longer there and that's how 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.850
 it will end badly luckily he 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.710
 there was no khiam since I took 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.510
 in the studio mode my pc being 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.520
 so rotten that I can not even 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.050
 to make rice ropes live 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.350
 it was bad 13 I hope that it has you 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.770
 enjoyed 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.770
 buy pc hi and good day
