00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.629
 to order 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 you should not think that it is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.070
 that there positions himself a box 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.360
 the bees invites rhine and then 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.950
 nothing more to do so you have to

 to deal with it and you 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.840

 just a few bees and everything goes 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.710
 well that did not work 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.630
