so you can see here we have many sound
waves<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.860> together<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.790> my<00:00:30.060> mini

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

Optimus<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.960> mini<00:00:31.320> Megatron<00:00:31.920> check<00:00:32.250> those

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
Optimus and mini Megatron check those

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
Optimus and mini Megatron check those
out<00:00:32.519> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.699> haven't<00:00:32.879> seen<00:00:33.179> them<00:00:33.329> already<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
out if you haven't seen them already and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.450 
out if you haven't seen them already and
hopefully<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.679> some<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:34.949> to<00:00:35.070> come<00:00:35.250> so

it's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.640> reboot<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.179> my<00:00:36.390> old<00:00:36.600> TJ<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.769> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it's a reboot of my old TJ one it's a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.650 
it's a reboot of my old TJ one it's a
bit<00:00:37.980> taller<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.670> poseable<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> course<00:00:39.510> with

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
bit taller more poseable of course with

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
bit taller more poseable of course with
the<00:00:39.749> new<00:00:39.780> ball<00:00:40.050> joints<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.829> let's<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.160> right

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the new ball joints so let's get right

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.919 
the new ball joints so let's get right
to<00:00:41.280> transformation<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:42.329> pretty<00:00:42.600> much<00:00:42.749> like

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
to transformation it's pretty much like

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.489 
to transformation it's pretty much like
the<00:00:43.050> g1<00:00:43.350> toy<00:00:43.499> also<00:00:44.249> did<00:00:44.719> his<00:00:45.719> friend<00:00:46.019> Laserbeak

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
the g1 toy also did his friend Laserbeak

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.009 
the g1 toy also did his friend Laserbeak
I<00:00:46.969> won't<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.120> credit<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.719> design

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
I won't take credit for this design

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.989 
I won't take credit for this design
because<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.559> much<00:00:49.649> seen<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> done

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
because I have pretty much seen it done

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.660 
because I have pretty much seen it done
before<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.960> pretty<00:00:52.230> simple<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.769> just<00:00:52.859> two

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
before it's pretty simple it's just two

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
before it's pretty simple it's just two
hinges<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.300> some<00:00:54.929> tiles<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.499> tooth<00:00:55.679> piece

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
hinges and some tiles and a tooth piece

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
hinges and some tiles and a tooth piece
and<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.429> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> pull<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.089> like

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and you just kind of pull them out like

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.349 
and you just kind of pull them out like
that<00:00:58.850> and<00:01:00.079> that's<00:01:01.079> Laserbeak<00:01:02.179> so<00:01:03.179> that's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that and that's Laserbeak so that's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
that and that's Laserbeak so that's
pretty<00:01:03.629> simple<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.230> then<00:01:04.500> transformation<00:01:04.980> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
pretty simple and then transformation of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.860 
pretty simple and then transformation of
the<00:01:05.700> big<00:01:05.850> guy<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.630> course<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.470> similar<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> g1

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
the big guy of course very similar to g1

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.380 
the big guy of course very similar to g1
you<00:01:09.870> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.260> pull<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> legs<00:01:11.570> twist

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
you want to just pull out the legs twist

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.790 
you want to just pull out the legs twist
twist<00:01:15.860> twist<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> legs<00:01:17.310> forward<00:01:18.710> pull<00:01:19.710> out

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
twist twist the legs forward pull out

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:28.760 
twist twist the legs forward pull out
the<00:01:19.950> feet<00:01:21.950> do<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.980> same

you<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.869> head<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.619> old<00:01:58.830> head<00:01:59.039> I<00:01:59.130> used

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you and the head is the old head I used

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.399 
you and the head is the old head I used
for<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> old<00:01:59.789> design<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.580> kind<00:02:02.580> of

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
for the old design and it's kind of

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.509 
for the old design and it's kind of
stiff<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:05.009> pull<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.950> spin<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> right

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.789 

and<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.760> my<00:02:12.209> friend<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.720> about<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:16.319> as

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
and that my friend is about that the as

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.559 
and that my friend is about that the as
I<00:02:16.830> said<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> chest<00:02:17.489> opens<00:02:17.819> but<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> cavity<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
I said the chest opens but the cavity is

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.370 
I said the chest opens but the cavity is
not<00:02:18.750> big<00:02:19.500> enough<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:20.390> Laserbeak<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.260> my

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
not big enough for Laserbeak that was my

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.740 
not big enough for Laserbeak that was my
old<00:02:22.560> design<00:02:22.920> basically<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.180> could<00:02:24.269> fit<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> 1

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
old design basically you could fit a 1

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.440 
old design basically you could fit a 1
by<00:02:24.900> 2<00:02:24.959> tile<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.100> there<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.519> that's<00:02:26.970> what<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> did

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
by 2 tile in there and that's what I did

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.449 
by 2 tile in there and that's what I did
for<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.959> old<00:02:28.110> design<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.069> design<00:02:29.340> they

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
for the old design but this design they

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.430 
for the old design but this design they
won't<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.819> have<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> companion<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.170> he

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
won't have to have a companion so he

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.770 
won't have to have a companion so he
does<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.950> his<00:02:32.099> friend<00:02:32.340> Laserbeak<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.209> you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
does have his friend Laserbeak and you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.770 
does have his friend Laserbeak and you
