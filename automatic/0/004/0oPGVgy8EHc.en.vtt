00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.423
 HELLO EVERYONE, WE ARE MARKO AND ALEX AND WE ARE VAGABROTHERS 

00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:13.400
 WELCOME TO FURTHER EPISOD "HOW TO WORK THE WORLD?" 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.100
 WE HAVE LAUNCHED AT TIME 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.500
 THIS WILL BE ABOUT THE MONEY 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.437
 LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE US 

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:20.656
 HOW DO I SAVE ON THE WAY? 

00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:21.853
 NO, SURPRISE 

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:23.977
 There is no magic trick 

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:26.233
 WITHOUT YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION 

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:27.931
 THE KEY IS ALSO THE SAME 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.000
 CHOOSE TO GO, WORK HARD TO SAVE MONEY, 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.547
 AND SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE STYLE 

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:35.375
 REMEMBER THAT MANY WAYS TO TRAVEL 

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.292
 IF YOU ARE STUDENT, STUDY ABROAD 

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:39.543
 IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTED, LEARN ENGLISH 

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.064
 IF YOU STILL YOURSELF, GO TO FOREIGN PROGRAM 

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:44.356
 USE YOUR SKILLING SKILLS 

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.424
 DURING TRAVEL 

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:48.027
 OR IF YOU BUILD A CAREER 

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.402
 ASK THE COMPANY IF IT IS OFFERED ABROAD 

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.223
 YOU CAN REQUEST TRANSFER 

00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:54.723
 IN THE FURTHER EPISODES WE WILL TAKE THESE METHODS 

00:00:54.723 --> 00:00:57.887
 NOW BUT BACK TO "HOW TO SAVE MONEY?" 

00:00:57.887 --> 00:00:59.399
 Let's say it easy 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360
 SAVINGS ARE INCOME LESS EXPENSES 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.306
 SO YOU MUST GET MORE OR LOSE LESS 

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.646
 And IDEAL BOTH 

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:10.000
 YEAR 1 DECIDE TO 100% FOR YOUR WAY 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 AND BUY A TICKET 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.136
 I KNOW IT IS A LARGE SINGLE EXPENDITURE 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:15.532
 BUT BELIEVE ME 

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:17.221
 WHAT YOU BUY ONE BEFORE, THERE'S A LITTER WILL BE 

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.749
 And moreover, you do one thing, you already have to go 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.698
 NOW WHEN YOU HAVE BROKEN TO THE ROAD 

00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:23.579
 TIME TO STEP 2 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:24.656
 MAKE MORE MONEY 

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:26.554
 NOT THE EASY WAY TO DO IT 

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.312
 DO IT ANYTHING TO GO 

00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:30.586
 TAKE EXTRA SHIFT, PARTIAL TARGET, .. 

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:33.416
 AND REMEMBER THAT IT IS ALWAYS EASIER 

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:35.984
 SAVE IN A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG CURRENCY 

00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:38.859
 AND WRITE IN COUNTRIES WITH A LOW CURRENCY 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.152
 STEP 3 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.419
 BE SAVING 

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:44.858
 THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP THAT YOU HAVE CHECK 

00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:49.712
 EVERYTHING WE LOSE FOR THINGS WE WANT, WE DO NOT NEED 

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:51.413
 KEEP MONEY WHAT YOU WANT 

00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:52.581
 How often you eat outside 

00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.485
 YOU HAVE BUYED A NEW TV OR GAUCH 

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.361
 AND YOU REALLY NEEDED THE LAST DRINKS IN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT 

00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.049
 PROBABLY NOT 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.029
 ONE OF OUR FANTS: 

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.370
 ALSO IMPORTANT TO ART SAVE 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.759
 IS LEARNING TO WORK 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.439
 TRY TO LIVE LOW 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.254
 PREPARING YOUR HOME FOOD 

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:12.500
 FIND SHOWS, GAMES, OR GALLERY FOR FREE 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.332
 UNIVERSITY OR BOTTLE EVENING EVENINGS IN THE SURROUNDINGS AROUND THE WEEK 

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:17.767
 VERY GOOD 

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:22.668
 THIS IS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT TRAVEL CAN BE LESS THAN 20 DOLLARS per DAY 

00:02:22.668 --> 00:02:24.336
 YOU KNOW THAT YOU SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.700
 IT'S THE BEST WHAT YOU CAN DO 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.900
 TO SAVE SAVE WHAT'S LONG SAVING YOU 

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.599
 THIS WAS A BRIEF OVERVIEW 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.500
 ABOUT HOW TO SAVE ON THE WAY 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.040
 LESS FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC NUMBERS 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.707
 AND MORE ON REVIEWING HOW TO TAKE TIME AND MONEY 

00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:41.088
 THAT IS ALL FOR THIS EPISOD 

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:44.731
 BUT ALWAYS WE HAVE MANY OTHER ADVICE FOR YOU 

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.123
 HOW TO PUT YOUR QUESTIONS TO COMMENTS 

00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:50.934
 OR ON SOCIAL NETWORKS, WE ARE VAGABROTHERS 

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.493
 We look forward to seeing you on the road 

00:02:53.493 --> 00:03:05.656
