a<00:01:48.420> dislike<00:01:48.840> maybe<00:01:49.170> superpower<00:01:49.740> maybe<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a dislike maybe superpower maybe and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.790

Paula fight each other and they're going

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.880 
Paula fight each other and they're going
to<00:02:43.239> underestimate<00:02:43.840> humans<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.530> we've<00:02:44.709> seen

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
to underestimate humans that we've seen

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.530 
to underestimate humans that we've seen
with<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.040> lot<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.370> anime<00:02:45.879> you<00:02:46.030> know<00:02:46.180> when<00:02:46.420> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
with a lot of anime you know when you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.259 
with a lot of anime you know when you
understand<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.349> underestimate<00:02:47.980> humans

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
understand when you underestimate humans

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.819 
understand when you underestimate humans
yeah<00:02:49.269> that's<00:02:49.480> when<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.900> die<00:02:50.079> but<00:02:50.739> it

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
yeah that's when you die but it

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.229 
yeah that's when you die but it
looks<00:02:50.980> like<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> humans<00:02:51.549> were<00:02:51.670> prepared<00:02:52.060> for

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
looks like the humans were prepared for

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.089 
looks like the humans were prepared for
this<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.599> we<00:02:52.900> see<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.319> our<00:02:53.349> children

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
this because we see that our children

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.890 
this because we see that our children
not<00:02:54.579> children<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.209> teenagers<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
not children but like teenagers and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.690 
not children but like teenagers and
adults<00:02:55.989> are<00:02:56.409> training<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:56.980> these<00:02:57.159> Gundams

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
adults are training in these Gundams

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.539 
adults are training in these Gundams
these<00:02:58.239> robots<00:02:58.659> to<00:02:59.290> probably<00:02:59.859> to<00:03:00.160> fight<00:03:00.370> these

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
these robots to probably to fight these

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.670 
these robots to probably to fight these
guys<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.090> guess<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.870> adults<00:03:02.230> here<00:03:02.379> you<00:03:02.590> know

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
guys I guess the adults here you know

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.099 
guys I guess the adults here you know
they<00:03:02.890> know<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.310> true<00:03:03.609> nature<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.480> these<00:03:04.840> um

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
they know the true nature of these um

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.160 
they know the true nature of these um
humans<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:06.370> are<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.640> space<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.209> they're

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
humans that are in space and they're

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.900 
humans that are in space and they're
lying<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.650> these<00:03:08.769> kids<00:03:09.099> also<00:03:09.310> they're<00:03:09.670> lying

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
lying to these kids also they're lying

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.869 
lying to these kids also they're lying
to<00:03:10.060> say<00:03:10.660> no<00:03:11.019> we're<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:11.620> doing<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.069> for<00:03:12.129> just

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
to say no we're just doing this for just

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.520 
to say no we're just doing this for just
in<00:03:13.060> case<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:13.239> gonna<00:03:13.510> happen<00:03:13.659> they<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.379> say

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
in case it's gonna happen they just say

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.229 
in case it's gonna happen they just say
you<00:03:14.890> know<00:03:14.920> there's<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> slim<00:03:15.609> chance<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:16.090> will

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
you know there's a slim chance this will

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.030 
you know there's a slim chance this will
happen<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.140> chances<00:03:17.560> aren't<00:03:17.739> actually

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
happen but the chances aren't actually

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.399 
happen but the chances aren't actually
really<00:03:18.370> great<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:18.879> now<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.810> guess<00:03:20.109> it's<00:03:20.290> up<00:03:20.349> to

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
really great and now I guess it's up to

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.960 
really great and now I guess it's up to
them<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.709> go<00:03:21.010> into<00:03:21.220> these<00:03:21.340> guns<00:03:21.579> dumped<00:03:21.819> and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
something like that so definitely this

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.050 
something like that so definitely this
guy's<00:04:29.560> Lane<00:04:29.889> is<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.099> human<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.520> really<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.789> big

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.510 
guy's Lane is a human is really a big
huge<00:04:31.599> part<00:04:31.960> with<00:04:32.080> this<00:04:32.229> he<00:04:32.889> admits<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520

so I am really enjoying this episode and
hopefully<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.830> keeps<00:05:02.069> this<00:05:02.340> up<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.000> really

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
hopefully it keeps this up and I really

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.610 
hopefully it keeps this up and I really
do<00:05:03.449> hope<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.810> isn't<00:05:04.050> what<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.169> shall<00:05:04.410> go<00:05:04.590> there

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
do hope it isn't what I shall go there

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.309 
do hope it isn't what I shall go there
so<00:05:04.979> we'd<00:05:05.849> be<00:05:05.940> mad<00:05:06.150> but<00:05:06.449> it<00:05:06.569> does<00:05:06.720> have<00:05:06.870> common

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
so we'd be mad but it does have common

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.290 
so we'd be mad but it does have common
but<00:05:07.590> yes<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:07.919> is<00:05:08.340> very<00:05:08.550> promising<00:05:08.819> in<00:05:09.210> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
but yes this is very promising in the
