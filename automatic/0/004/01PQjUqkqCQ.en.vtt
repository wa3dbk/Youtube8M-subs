engineer<00:02:26.879> oh<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.470> feel<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.920> i<00:02:29.190> would<00:02:29.580> like

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
engineer oh I feel like I i would like

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.479 
engineer oh I feel like I i would like
to<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.569> De<00:02:30.810> Niro's<00:02:31.230> son<00:02:31.709> or<00:02:32.069> something

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
to be like De Niro's son or something

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.660 
to be like De Niro's son or something
but<00:02:32.670> i<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:33.090> i<00:02:33.360> would<00:02:34.200> probably<00:02:34.860> end<00:02:35.160> up

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670 
but i think i would probably end up
being<00:02:35.940> Charles<00:02:36.750> Grodin<00:02:36.930> son<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
being Charles Grodin son I think that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.040 
being Charles Grodin son I think that
it's<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.310> little<00:02:38.340> better<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.870> De

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.259 
it's a little better if you could be De
Niro<00:02:40.260> sign<00:02:40.590> okay<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.190> could<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.489> Grodin<00:02:41.849> son<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
Niro sign okay I could be Grodin son and

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.850 
Niro sign okay I could be Grodin son and
