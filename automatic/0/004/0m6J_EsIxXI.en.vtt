00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.490 

the<00:00:13.280> 11th<00:00:13.969> cranial<00:00:14.299> nerve<00:00:14.450> is<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.809> spinal

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
the 11th cranial nerve is the spinal

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.950 
the 11th cranial nerve is the spinal
accessory<00:00:15.740> nerve<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.180> there<00:00:17.480> are<00:00:17.539> two<00:00:17.689> parts

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
accessory nerve so there are two parts

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.780 
accessory nerve so there are two parts
to<00:00:18.230> it<00:00:18.260> but<00:00:18.410> in<00:00:18.619> essence<00:00:18.920> in<00:00:19.039> terms<00:00:19.220> of<00:00:19.369> testing

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
to it but in essence in terms of testing

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.030 
to it but in essence in terms of testing
it's<00:00:20.000> testing<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.840> muscles<00:00:21.169> around<00:00:21.290> the<00:00:21.860> neck

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
it's testing the muscles around the neck

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.730 
it's testing the muscles around the neck
it<00:00:22.310> tests<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:25.150> sternocleidomastoid<00:00:26.740> muscles

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
it tests the sternocleidomastoid muscles

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.240 
it tests the sternocleidomastoid muscles
and<00:00:27.919> a<00:00:28.610> test<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.000> trapeze<00:00:29.450> yay<00:00:29.630> now<00:00:30.619> to<00:00:31.099> do

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
and a test the trapeze yay now to do

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.979 
and a test the trapeze yay now to do
this<00:00:31.430> like<00:00:31.640> all<00:00:31.820> muscles<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.570> first<00:00:32.840> thing

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
this like all muscles the first thing

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.110 
this like all muscles the first thing
you<00:00:33.079> must<00:00:33.170> do<00:00:33.380> is<00:00:33.590> look<00:00:34.219> at<00:00:34.340> them<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:34.700> must<00:00:34.850> see

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
you must do is look at them you must see

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.760 
you must do is look at them you must see
if<00:00:35.210> there's<00:00:35.360> any<00:00:35.450> wasting<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.320> must<00:00:36.500> see<00:00:36.649> if

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
if there's any wasting you must see if

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.740 
if there's any wasting you must see if
there<00:00:36.890> are<00:00:36.980> fasciculations<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.420> test

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
there are fasciculations and then test

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.090 
there are fasciculations and then test
the<00:00:38.899> power<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.290> once<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:39.590> keep<00:00:39.710> doing<00:00:39.980> things

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
the power and once you keep doing things

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.220 
the power and once you keep doing things
methodically<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:41.030> becomes<00:00:41.360> second<00:00:42.200> nature

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
methodically it becomes second nature

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.110 
methodically it becomes second nature
really<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.129> I'd<00:00:43.460> have<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.760> look<00:00:43.910> at<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
really so I'd have to look at the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.700 
really so I'd have to look at the
muscles<00:00:44.420> first<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:44.870> if<00:00:45.019> you<00:00:45.109> don't<00:00:45.260> mind<00:00:45.410> again

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
muscles first so if you don't mind again

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.709 
muscles first so if you don't mind again
would<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:45.829> mind<00:00:46.039> just<00:00:46.190> exposing<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.629> get

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
would you mind just exposing the to get

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.029 
would you mind just exposing the to get
off<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.899> top<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.260> looking<00:00:48.469> at<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.649> trapeze

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
off the top and looking at the trapeze

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.310 
off the top and looking at the trapeze
er<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.550> shoulder<00:00:50.059> muscles<00:00:50.359> that's<00:00:50.870> fine

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
er the shoulder muscles that's fine

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.439 
er the shoulder muscles that's fine
so<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.649> step<00:00:51.949> back<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.159> little<00:00:52.399> bit<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.789> look<00:00:53.149> for

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
so I step back a little bit and look for

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.930 
so I step back a little bit and look for
symmetry<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.499> I<00:00:54.949> can't<00:00:55.190> see<00:00:55.339> any<00:00:55.489> evidence<00:00:55.640> of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
symmetry and I can't see any evidence of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.090 
symmetry and I can't see any evidence of
wasting<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.659> little<00:00:57.260> bit<00:00:57.469> more<00:00:57.620> closely<00:00:57.920> I

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
wasting a little bit more closely I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.369 
wasting a little bit more closely I
might<00:00:58.309> look<00:00:58.429> for<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.569> circulations<00:01:00.230> or

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
might look for the circulations or

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.500 
might look for the circulations or
jumpiness<00:01:00.769> of<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.100> muscle<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:01.489> there<00:01:02.300> aren't

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
jumpiness of the muscle and there aren't

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.600 
jumpiness of the muscle and there aren't
any<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.109> once<00:01:03.559> I've<00:01:03.679> established<00:01:03.800> established

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
any so once I've established established

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.120 
any so once I've established established
that<00:01:05.089> I'll<00:01:05.479> ask<00:01:05.690> him<00:01:05.870> to<00:01:06.020> shrug<00:01:06.800> up<00:01:06.979> your

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
that I'll ask him to shrug up your

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.010 
that I'll ask him to shrug up your
shoulders<00:01:07.490> please<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.570> symmetrical

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
shoulders please and it's symmetrical

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.149 
shoulders please and it's symmetrical
now<00:01:09.170> I'm<00:01:09.229> going<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.440> test<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.740> power<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.100> I'm

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
now I'm going to test the power so I'm

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.040 
now I'm going to test the power so I'm
going<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.340> push<00:01:11.090> up<00:01:11.240> against<00:01:11.600> me<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:11.870> don't

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
going to push up against me and don't

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.410 
going to push up against me and don't
let<00:01:12.140> me<00:01:12.290> hurt<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.470> push<00:01:12.770> up<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.820> that's<00:01:14.180> fine

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
let me hurt you push up and that's fine

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.350 
let me hurt you push up and that's fine
so<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:14.780> great<00:01:14.960> five<00:01:15.229> over<00:01:15.530> five<00:01:15.710> power<00:01:16.009> there

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
so it's great five over five power there

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.389 
so it's great five over five power there
the<00:01:17.360> other<00:01:17.509> muscles<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:17.990> test<00:01:18.200> other<00:01:18.380> as<00:01:18.649> I

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
the other muscles you test other as I

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.770 
the other muscles you test other as I
said<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.619> sternocleidomastoid<00:01:21.969> muscle<00:01:22.969> now

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
said the sternocleidomastoid muscle now

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.709 
said the sternocleidomastoid muscle now
to<00:01:24.290> test<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.250> left<00:01:25.729> sternocleidomastoid

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
to test the left sternocleidomastoid

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.170 
to test the left sternocleidomastoid
muscle<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.860> patient<00:01:28.250> turns<00:01:28.399> ahead<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
muscle the patient turns ahead to the

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.569 
muscle the patient turns ahead to the
right<00:01:29.799> away<00:01:30.799> from<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.070> nation<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.399> you<00:01:31.460> can

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
right away from the nation and you can

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.770 
right away from the nation and you can
see<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.789> fairly<00:01:32.060> clearly<00:01:32.240> it'll<00:01:32.479> come<00:01:32.600> through

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
see it fairly clearly it'll come through

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.990 
see it fairly clearly it'll come through
here<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.140> we<00:01:33.530> turn<00:01:33.740> towards<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.820> wall

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
here so we turn towards the wall

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.109 
here so we turn towards the wall
therefore<00:01:35.390> don't<00:01:35.479> mind<00:01:35.659> all<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.560> way<00:01:36.649> over

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
therefore don't mind all the way over

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.639 
therefore don't mind all the way over
perfect<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.420> hold<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.719> there<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.289> I<00:01:39.380> want<00:01:39.590> you

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
perfect I hold it there and I want you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.740 
perfect I hold it there and I want you
to<00:01:39.680> push<00:01:39.950> against<00:01:40.250> my<00:01:40.460> hand<00:01:40.490> push<00:01:41.359> hard<00:01:41.600> and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
to push against my hand push hard and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.060 
to push against my hand push hard and
you<00:01:42.469> can<00:01:42.619> see<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:43.689> sternocleidomastoid

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
you can see that sternocleidomastoid

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.529 
you can see that sternocleidomastoid
muscle<00:01:46.070> there<00:01:46.219> perfectly<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.090> if<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.390> turn

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
muscle there perfectly and if it turn

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.109 
muscle there perfectly and if it turn
away<00:01:47.689> from<00:01:47.810> me<00:01:48.079> all<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.740> way<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.119> push

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
away from me all the way and push

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.069 
away from me all the way and push
against<00:01:50.420> my<00:01:50.600> hand<00:01:52.060> sternocleidomastoid

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
against my hand sternocleidomastoid

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.749 
against my hand sternocleidomastoid
muscle<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:54.380> no<00:01:54.590> loss<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:55.039> would<00:01:55.399> recommend

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
muscle and no loss I would recommend

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.669 
muscle and no loss I would recommend
this<00:01:55.909> stage<00:01:56.090> also<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.109> would<00:01:57.229> test<00:01:57.409> neck

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
this stage also that you would test neck
