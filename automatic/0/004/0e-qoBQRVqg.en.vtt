with<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:04.100> as<00:03:05.100> far<00:03:05.370> as<00:03:05.400> length<00:03:05.760> goes<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
with it as far as length goes this is a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:17.199 
with it as far as length goes this is a
16<00:03:07.080> inch<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.770> I'm<00:03:08.610> 54<00:03:10.760> 155<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:15.420> okay<00:03:15.840> a

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
16 inch and I'm 54 155 so it's okay a

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.490 
16 inch and I'm 54 155 so it's okay a
lot<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.239> someone<00:03:18.510> absolutely<00:03:18.959> why<00:03:19.110> did<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.320> move

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500

year<00:03:24.180> ago<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.600> probably<00:03:24.840> wasn't<00:03:25.110> going<00:03:25.290> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.680 
year ago so I probably wasn't going to
use<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.650> again<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.820> because<00:03:27.150> i<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.390> run<00:03:27.540> out

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
closure instead of trying to match it

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.789 
closure instead of trying to match it
with<00:03:35.190> regular<00:03:35.810> any<00:03:36.810> other<00:03:37.049> type<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.320> here<00:03:37.560> I

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
just use my closure and then someone

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.920 
just use my closure and then someone
suggested<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.580> pull<00:03:41.910> my<00:03:42.120> hair<00:03:42.360> all<00:03:42.630> back

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.140 
suggested that I pull my hair all back
but<00:03:43.320> honestly<00:03:43.799> my<00:03:43.890> head<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.310> too<00:03:44.549> large<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.120> be

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
but honestly my head is too large to be

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.960
