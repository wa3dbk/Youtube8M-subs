00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
as well as a front facing camera some of

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.190 
as well as a front facing camera some of
the<00:00:57.800> software<00:00:58.160> here<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.690> was<00:00:59.930> something

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
the software here that I was something

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.110 
the software here that I was something
about<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.470> design<00:01:00.770> is<00:01:00.950> actually<00:01:01.130> it's<00:01:01.489> water

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
about the design is actually it's water

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.630 
about the design is actually it's water
resistant<00:01:02.720> so<00:01:02.899> it<00:01:02.930> has<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.640> water-resistant

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
resistant so it has a water-resistant

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.249 
resistant so it has a water-resistant
nano<00:01:04.879> coating<00:01:05.299> that's<00:01:05.360> been<00:01:05.540> treated<00:01:05.899> on<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
nano coating that's been treated on the

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.380 
nano coating that's been treated on the
entire<00:01:06.979> outside<00:01:07.460> as<00:01:07.640> well<00:01:07.670> as<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.030> internal

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
entire outside as well as the internal

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.440 
entire outside as well as the internal
so<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.840> case<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.049> spill<00:01:09.979> something<00:01:10.130> or<00:01:10.759> it

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
so in case you spill something or it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.780 
so in case you spill something or it
gets<00:01:11.840> rained<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.979> water<00:01:13.159> resistant

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
gets rained on the water resistant

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.600 
gets rained on the water resistant
