basically just thrown away is because it

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.020 
basically just thrown away is because it

then<00:05:07.380> we<00:05:07.530> have<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.720> controller<00:05:09.720> this<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.260> your

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
then we have the controller this is your

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.440 
then we have the controller this is your
pointer<00:05:10.920> controller<00:05:11.370> it's<00:05:11.910> not<00:05:12.060> one<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
pointer controller it's not one of the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.070 
pointer controller it's not one of the
best<00:05:12.600> controllers<00:05:13.820> this<00:05:14.820> is<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.120> huge<00:05:15.570> power

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
best controllers this is a huge power

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.680 
best controllers this is a huge power
lead<00:05:16.370> it's<00:05:17.370> not<00:05:17.520> quite<00:05:17.730> heavy<00:05:17.940> so<00:05:18.060> it's<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.450> lot

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
lead it's not quite heavy so it's a lot

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.820 
lead it's not quite heavy so it's a lot
of<00:05:18.810> space<00:05:19.080> for<00:05:19.340> only<00:05:20.630> not<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.990> many<00:05:22.230> content

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
of space for only not that many content

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.100 
of space for only not that many content
and<00:05:23.010> has<00:05:23.460> a<00:05:23.490> really<00:05:23.760> strange<00:05:24.180> connector<00:05:24.720> like

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
and has a really strange connector like

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.880 
and has a really strange connector like
UTP<00:05:25.740> like<00:05:25.980> internet<00:05:26.490> cable<00:05:26.870> why<00:05:27.870> not<00:05:28.290> just<00:05:28.650> use

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
UTP like internet cable why not just use

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.830 
UTP like internet cable why not just use
a<00:05:28.920> regular<00:05:29.310> connector<00:05:30.030> that<00:05:30.180> everyone<00:05:30.630> has

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
a regular connector that everyone has

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.840 
a regular connector that everyone has
that<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.200> can<00:05:31.230> replace<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.010> connector<00:05:32.760> if

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
that you can replace the connector if

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.410 
that you can replace the connector if
it's<00:05:33.030> broken

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
it's broken

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.380 
it's broken
here's<00:05:34.290> arrrg<00:05:34.830> RGB<00:05:35.670> or<00:05:36.740> scarred<00:05:37.740> or<00:05:38.390> compose

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
here's arrrg RGB or scarred or compose

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.200 
here's arrrg RGB or scarred or compose
composite<00:05:40.200> connector<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.660> last<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:44.550> CDI

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
composite connector and last the CDI

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.170 
composite connector and last the CDI
itself<00:05:45.810> so<00:05:46.500> this<00:05:46.680> is<00:05:46.830> model<00:05:47.190> 450<00:05:47.880> there's<00:05:48.120> a

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
itself so this is model 450 there's a

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.880 
itself so this is model 450 there's a
lot<00:05:48.480> of<00:05:48.570> different<00:05:48.900> models<00:05:49.020> there's<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.440> 210

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
lot of different models there's to 210

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.930 
lot of different models there's to 210
to<00:05:50.010> 220<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.760> a<00:05:51.000> bunch<00:05:51.390> more<00:05:51.480> and<00:05:52.400> this<00:05:53.400> is<00:05:53.669> with

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
to 220 and a bunch more and this is with

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.880 
to 220 and a bunch more and this is with
a<00:05:53.970> CD<00:05:54.330> tray<00:05:54.690> that<00:05:54.870> just<00:05:55.080> has<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.260> click<00:05:55.680> down

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
a CD tray that just has to click down

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.270 
a CD tray that just has to click down
there<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:57.600> have<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:57.840> CD<00:05:58.110> player<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:58.560> the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
there you have the CD player and the

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.530 
there you have the CD player and the
thing<00:05:59.490> is<00:05:59.610> that<00:05:59.760> most<00:05:59.880> people<00:06:00.240> don't<00:06:00.390> know

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
thing is that most people don't know

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.490 
thing is that most people don't know
that<00:06:01.530> if<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.800> pop<00:06:02.250> these<00:06:02.430> lids<00:06:02.700> here<00:06:03.380> try<00:06:04.380> and

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
that if you pop these lids here try and

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.960 
that if you pop these lids here try and
do<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:04.740> with<00:06:04.890> one<00:06:05.040> hand<00:06:05.070> in<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.430> air<00:06:05.520> is<00:06:05.760> hard

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
do that with one hand in the air is hard

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.030 
do that with one hand in the air is hard
but<00:06:06.660> there<00:06:06.960> is<00:06:07.140> your<00:06:07.260> connector<00:06:07.740> for<00:06:07.980> the

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
but there is your connector for the

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.750 
but there is your connector for the
video<00:06:08.760> cartridge<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:11.220> video<00:06:11.430> cartridge

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
video cartridge and the video cartridge

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.340 
video cartridge and the video cartridge
that<00:06:11.940> goes<00:06:12.090> in<00:06:12.240> this<00:06:12.390> console<00:06:12.780> is<00:06:12.930> different

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
that goes in this console is different

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.380 
that goes in this console is different
than<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:13.590> one<00:06:13.710> that<00:06:13.740> goes<00:06:14.010> in<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.250> 210<00:06:14.640> or<00:06:14.820> 220

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
than the one that goes in the 210 or 220

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.320 
than the one that goes in the 210 or 220
model<00:06:15.690> because<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.590> is<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.890> smaller<00:06:17.160> one

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
model because this is the smaller one

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.250 
model because this is the smaller one
here<00:06:18.330> you<00:06:18.450> have<00:06:18.630> controller<00:06:19.110> port<00:06:19.530> one
