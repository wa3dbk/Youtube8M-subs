 the presence of rains accompanied by

 electric orizaba and xalapa with these 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.330

 pacific mexican and the gulf of mexico 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.340
 due to this zone of instability that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.440
 will be generating the presence of rains 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.970
