00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everyone with you sanchez and you look 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.560
 building number 2 sims 4 i'm happy to show 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 you this wonderful cottage under 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.219
 red daisy 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.960
 in general this video will be without accelerated 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.690
 construction, that is, I will not show you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.490
 how this house built from the very beginning everything 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.199
 due to the fact that this house was built 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 for competition and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 to make it good and perfect 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.119
 I had a lot of him temporarily 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.650
 spend and I think that it is very you 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 I like it a lot because I like it 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.669
 like and generally this is the best 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 the construction of sims 4 which i built 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 let me start showing it to you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.840
 in principle, you already see it two-storied 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.610
 cottage red and white black colors and 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.739
 very similar to the house enchanted then 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.050
 watched TV shows maybe now 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.710
 He remembers how they looked at the food house 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.879
 very so beautiful but simple yes 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.879
 guys are simple 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.460
 outside and inside there inside you there 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.980
 it's not easy at all so similar to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.589
 box but guys i tried it 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.229
 do the traditional that is, I did not want 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.970
 whales bells and whistles do yes I do right away 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 showing the back plot on the back 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.010
 plot we just have a gazebo well 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.100
 when arbor where you can fry something 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.810
 and so on just sit by the way this 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.470
 completed the house with the same update 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 swimming pools but I didn't get here a swimming pool 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 attach if you need yourself 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 can attach because I'm a vessel 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.200
 build a pool seems to me external 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.689
 the view of the house is lost that is such 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640
 option should be back plot well 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.829
 that 's basically what it looks like of course 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.110
 Now I will begin to show the very first too 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.280
 so therefore give them the key to the first floor 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.140
 and maybe we will make on such walls 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.930
 that on the ground there is the same as always 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 kitchen-dining room living here yet 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.060
 cabinet added yes and a large hall 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.770
 have a hallway really like not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.540
 arrangement of rooms that is in principle 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 your systems can go to the kitchen 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 cook something then go to 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 dining to eat sweat living 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.659
 have fun and in the office their affairs 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.140
 do yes in general inside this is a house on 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.479
 mention 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.900
 me in a Victorian style and so 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.240
 classic setting here but everywhere 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.270
 very luxuriously agree especially 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.920
 living room yes but Iâ€™ll tell them right away that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.200
 the video will not be short at the end you 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.240
 you will see a view from 1 person that is according to this 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.770
 home I will walk in the first person maybe 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.140
 it will be interesting to see how 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.600
 the interior looks completely that is 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.560
 walls as combined and so on well and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 the toilet here is small just 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.910
 toilet and sink so that guests could that 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.250
 here to do well, in principle, that's how it goes 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.830
 first floor I think quite quite and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.320
 and guests can be invited to very 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.970
 a lot because a very large dining room 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.000
 I think that he is definitely not here 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.209
 face and sit quietly there 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.700
 eating very much reminds me of something like 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.310
 have year dining okay let's go over 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.090
 on the second floor and forgot to say that this 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.310
 houses 3 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.100
 baths that is inside the van and it does not matter 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.560
 what and three bedrooms and so here it is the second 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.660
 the floor here is two baths at once 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.579
 I will say about them especially about this bath 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.190
 just the same and i did for the contest 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.290
 maybe you should show it to her 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.730
 You may notice that as here is very 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.769
 many small items 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.019
 really i tried 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.600
 add such items that you 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.209
 added realism and to all this 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.660
 it looked cool well it seems to me 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.420
 turned out me well that there is a bedroom 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.380
 for parents, that's how it looks like this 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.140
 Oh gentle blue shades she and very me 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.450
 like too and of course the kids 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.980
 nursery here so here again this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.709
 room too for the contest was you 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.440
 just look at the abundance of items 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.310
 and even better then look from the first 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.680
 faces like this all looks yes and of course 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.850
 the last room left is the rooms 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120
 new year for an adult 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.489
 maybe for grandfather or grandmother she 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.080
 suitable or for some teen 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.090
 who is committed to knowledge and 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.360
 so it seems a little bit to me this one 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.220
 a dresser a little shabby somehow it's not 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.520
 See here but the other was not 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.799
 you can change yourself but also the hall 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.570
 also hallways comes from below here i 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.180
 put the royal standing here at all 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.580
 first sofa and put it here royal 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.230
 I think it fit perfectly though 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.170
 there is a little low ceiling 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.260
 now if you show it well yes here 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.470
 chandelier straight hanging over the piano I think sim 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.020
 they will head for her stumble and 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.780
 certainly small as it is a terrace or something 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.360
 yes you can just sit here too 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.600
 chat and so on in general like this 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.340
 This house looks like I think it goes nuts 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.520
 I like a lot because I really 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.310

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.410

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.750

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.820
 but what I want to tell you is that now you 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.130

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.650

 I built this house for a long time 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.590
 maybe a month but unfortunately for the contest 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.590
 I missed because it seems to me 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.140
 this house seemed quite ordinary but 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.110
