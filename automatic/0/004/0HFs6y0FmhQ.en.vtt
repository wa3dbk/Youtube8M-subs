that's<00:02:35.709> how<00:02:35.920> these<00:02:36.100> looked<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.990> ever

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
that's how these looked and if you ever

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.960 
that's how these looked and if you ever

see that on a Selmer usually that means

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
see that on a Selmer usually that means
that<00:02:40.420> you're<00:02:40.600> looking<00:02:40.840> at<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.020> original<00:02:41.200> pads

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
that you're looking at the original pads

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.530 
that you're looking at the original pads
and<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.880> know<00:02:42.970> I've<00:02:43.060> heard<00:02:43.180> people<00:02:43.360> say

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and you know I've heard people say

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.300 
and you know I've heard people say
several<00:02:44.080> times<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.709> just<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.100> myth

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
several times that this is just a myth

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.010 
several times that this is just a myth
but<00:02:45.610> I've<00:02:45.790> seen<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.209> probably<00:02:46.360> upwards<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.959> a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
but I've seen it probably upwards of a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.530 
but I've seen it probably upwards of a
hundred<00:02:47.140> times<00:02:47.580> taking<00:02:48.580> photos<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.270> still

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
hundred times taking photos and still

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.300 
hundred times taking photos and still
some<00:02:49.870> people<00:02:49.989> don't<00:02:50.320> believe<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:50.920> figured

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
some people don't believe but I figured

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.910 
some people don't believe but I figured
I<00:02:51.430> would<00:02:51.459> make<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.239> video<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.650> more<00:02:53.890> people

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
I would make a video so that more people

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.370 
I would make a video so that more people
can<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:54.370> what<00:02:54.850> I'm<00:02:55.090> talking<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:55.540> here<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
can see what I'm talking about here and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.550 
can see what I'm talking about here and
as<00:02:56.769> far<00:02:56.890> as<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.130> know<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.900> restricted

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
as far as I know this was restricted

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.210 
as far as I know this was restricted
mostly<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.989> balanced<00:03:01.989> action<00:03:02.220> through

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
mostly to the balanced action through

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.570 
mostly to the balanced action through
mark<00:03:04.090> six<00:03:04.390> run<00:03:05.130> although<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.250> wouldn't<00:03:06.459> be

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
mark six run although I wouldn't be

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.040 
mark six run although I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:06.910> if<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.150> was<00:03:07.209> earlier<00:03:07.570> but<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.840> think

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
surprised if it was earlier but I think

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.320 
surprised if it was earlier but I think
it<00:03:08.170> was<00:03:08.290> mostly<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.920> American<00:03:09.700> assembled

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
it was mostly on American assembled

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.420 
it was mostly on American assembled
horns<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.709> order<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.070> evade<00:03:12.400> tariffs<00:03:14.430> summer

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
horns in order to evade tariffs summer

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.199 
horns in order to evade tariffs summer
would<00:03:15.870> send<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.980> parts<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.760> saxophone

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
would send the parts of the saxophone

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.699 
would send the parts of the saxophone
here<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.019> US<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.670> they<00:03:21.670> would<00:03:21.820> be

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
here to the US and they would be

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.069 
here to the US and they would be
finished<00:03:23.709> in<00:03:23.980> Elkhart<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.760> I'm<00:03:25.480> not<00:03:25.690> totally

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
sure but word you know among repairmen

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.539 
sure but word you know among repairmen

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
