the pumpkin to get the four out of the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.020 
the pumpkin to get the four out of the
one<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.750> ok<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.019> now<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.009> mix<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
one can ok so now I'm going to mix the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
one can ok so now I'm going to mix the
wet<00:02:12.180> ingredients<00:02:12.239> into<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.200> dry<00:02:13.319> ingredients

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
wet ingredients into the dry ingredients

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.360 
wet ingredients into the dry ingredients
and<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:15.209> remember<00:02:15.450> not<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.019> overbeat<00:02:16.890> or

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and just remember not to overbeat or

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.110 
and just remember not to overbeat or
over<00:02:17.849> mix<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:19.610> I've<00:02:20.610> been<00:02:20.910> told

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
over mix this because I've been told

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.140 
over mix this because I've been told
that<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.500> ok<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.160> still<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.700> lumpy

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
that it's ok but still a little lumpy

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.630 
that it's ok but still a little lumpy
and<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.290> ever<00:02:25.500> mixed<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.129> don't<00:02:26.340> think<00:02:26.549> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and it's ever mixed I don't think it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.259 
and it's ever mixed I don't think it
will<00:02:26.730> rise<00:02:27.000> correctly<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.310> learned<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.849> in

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
will rise correctly so I learned that in

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.130 
will rise correctly so I learned that in
junior<00:02:30.930> high<00:02:31.640> from<00:02:32.640> miss<00:02:32.849> Ryan<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:35.370> right<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
junior high from miss Ryan all right and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
junior high from miss Ryan all right and
it<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.950> filling<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.489> my<00:02:39.920> mixing<00:02:40.920> bowl

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it this is filling up my mixing bowl

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.660 
it this is filling up my mixing bowl
pretty<00:02:41.549> much<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.799> other<00:02:44.010> needs<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.549> at

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
pretty much and the other needs to be at

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.819 
pretty much and the other needs to be at
400<00:02:45.420> you've<00:02:45.870> probably<00:02:46.110> should<00:02:46.410> turn<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.709> on

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
400 you've probably should turn that on

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.620 
400 you've probably should turn that on
before<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.250> start<00:02:47.579> measure<00:02:48.510> your

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
before you start measure your

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.479 
before you start measure your
ingredients<00:02:49.410> because<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.980> pretty<00:02:50.280> high

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
ingredients because it's pretty high

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.479 
ingredients because it's pretty high
it's<00:02:50.819> 400<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:51.630> about<00:02:51.780> 15<00:02:52.260> minutes<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:52.829> you

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
it's 400 for about 15 minutes but you

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.069 
it's 400 for about 15 minutes but you
check<00:02:54.319> because<00:02:55.319> I<00:02:55.470> originally<00:02:55.799> had<00:02:56.190> 20<00:02:57.079> 20

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
check because I originally had 20 20

check because I originally had 20 20
minutes<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.560> my<00:02:58.680> card<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.340> got<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.519> little

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
minutes on my card and they got a little

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.180 
minutes on my card and they got a little
bit<00:02:59.880> overdone<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.319> just<00:03:01.379> depending<00:03:02.099> on

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
bit overdone so it just depending on

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.830 
bit overdone so it just depending on
your<00:03:02.310> oven<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.000> kinds<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.390> hands<00:03:03.660> are

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
your oven and the kinds of hands are

your oven and the kinds of hands are
using<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.730> be<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:06.030> little<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.690> little<00:03:06.930> bit

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
using it could be a little a little bit

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.069 
using it could be a little a little bit
more<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.829> 15<00:03:08.280> minutes<00:03:08.579> works<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:09.090> me<00:03:09.239> ok<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
more but 15 minutes works for me ok and

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.470 
more but 15 minutes works for me ok and
