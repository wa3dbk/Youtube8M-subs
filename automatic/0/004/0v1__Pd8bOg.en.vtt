00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 Good evening everyone back on the channel is cool stuff I always am 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.290
 beloved 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.750
 tonight I want to propose the video review of an adidassss 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.689
 called archos combat then we will also see 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.240
 because it was called so 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 one of the islands of the 2010 album about a month ago so let's talk about 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.430
 for late September start tube for the date on which you start seeing started 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.699
 around 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.699
 hahaha among the yeah shops on the bay 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.480
 belonging to the zeal collection of the famous American fashion designer jeremy scott 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.200
 rap 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.100
 for me 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.690
 magazine weights with 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.160
 in a galdessa bust it makes it very very particular certainly very eccentric 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.130
 because this in particular between all its production in my opinion is 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.360
 to be particularly cool 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.860
 simply because the ass jeremy scott has not essentially been invented 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.520
 nothing has taken a very rich one 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.159
 nerf and then among other things also poke beads on all markets 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.290
 well adidas gsg9 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.580
 a boot for use therefore - you want military or at least for conditions but a 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.540
 bit extreme ax 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.740
 she has customized and trampoline we go to see what kind of 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.850
 apt customization placed on this shoe we say of comacchio 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 we immediately saw the shoe as usual 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.410
 what is compound to which we find ourselves 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.470
 sunday 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.180
 - let's say in the name maintained the gsg9 production line 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 it is therefore a shoe is made entirely in leather 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.630
 very soft 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.730
 very very comfortable 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.710
 we see the shape of the water the sole that has arrived anyway 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 in classic sole 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.220
 for trx it is therefore excellent 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 mol right 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.049
 let's see immediately the peculiarity is the trademark 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.389
 of art the designer of design 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.339
 and hence also the reason why he was named akross I fight 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.459
 but in reality we are talking about a gsg9 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.940
 is the application is let's say an embroidery done on school d this year 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.870
 beautiful on the cross and made by a little a cross of medieval inspiration is 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.370
 made realized converter - 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.909
 germ in short 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.249
 certainly not particularly valuable but 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.049
 extremely distortion 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.370
 the shoe looks like this overall so basically it's a little bit 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.620
 we can define it as an oxymoron because anyway 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.570
 and this mix between the model 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.210
 dachau nude in a few shaving lost marked this production 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.300
 specific of this boot the part of the relax for a little use 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.749
 extreme with this application 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.659
 reminder that makes it really a little unicatt 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.489
 in my opinion it is a very cool thing sincerely 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.529
 I am a happy owner of a 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:34.430
 of a gsg9 medin failure Germanic used a lot also for work 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.279
 I can assure you it is a cinzia natal shoes 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.379
 satellite resistant for all types of use 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.119
 the only thing k 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.449
 take let's say found 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.889
 great with me 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.679
 eh I don't want to call it a defect but a great oddity 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.819
 and in any case the total absence of the sun 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.320
 hahaha on this part of the assumption 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.390
 instead in the original gsg9 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.139
 there are 10 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.549
 sometimes even 11 reservations 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.029
 and this means that from money ita anyway it is to the whole ankle for 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:17.169
 this reason has been chosen by many bvp 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.449
 real drums omad be used in extreme conditions such as launch with the 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.759
 parachute 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.869
 but operations of raids and phosphorus or dry feet of water 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.020
 for I was saying that this is precisely the only small one 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.309
 what a strangeness that presents itself 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:42.009
 however try anyway explanation and origin from the moment you go to 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.209
 fasten the shoe to the neck so as an original gsg version 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.650
 shinee's room you will inevitably damage the tongue which is not 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.330
 other than the signature of the design and in any case the peculiarity of having this shot 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.699
 internally it is almost impossible to see it but it is still a well done to 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.530
 a kombu alga a really very positive feature is that to the 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.639
 scoletta 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.710
 which test hb net 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.440
 el therefore in short we can also personalize it in this sense and it is one 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.370
 extremely positive 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.310
 I have not found 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.130
 in the invoice no type of imperfection residues of glue or usb 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.150
 invoice 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.300
 the extremely clean line, the fit, fantastic 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.759
 like the whole line gsg9 first edition 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.659
 vermezzo 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.439
 the only flaw is fine also the box however it is different but 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.960
 because it belongs however is another type another type of collection on one 

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:53.449
 parallel connection to the line on collaboration in essence 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:00.069
 tel the only defect that represented this shoe is the difficulty in the 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.169
 retrieve it 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.139
 therefore it will surely be the object of cult of several collectors 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.860
 and maybe a little the price that saw a bit of exclusivity but it certainly is a 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.719
 little car anyway we talk about a price higher than 200 euros for this maybe 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.159
 the only sore point 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:24.019
 in the end I also want to be laying I want to be honest in the 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.339
 remember that the old gsg9 a had a price 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.339
 well over 250 euros until a few years ago until it was produced 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:34.830
 in short, a useful guide 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.830
 what pieces of anchor could be found 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:39.550
 in conclusion 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.330
 the shoe definitely particular in my opinion a full 9 in the most manner 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.020
 absolute em 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.409
 why not with 10 euros as regards 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:58.259
 to originality is a little alan let's say from the spirit he wanted 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.259
 impress on this shoe el 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.449
 for the reviews of anto also this evening is all reference to the next 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.919
 review hoping to have made a useful service curious facility of 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.189
 know more about this scale 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:14.059
