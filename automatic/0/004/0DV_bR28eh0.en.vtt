00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.120
 another video of me in this 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.160
 video again make a very good 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.160
 Tricks before a lot of fun 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.750
 there are still a lot of me 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.790
 people write what tricks because so 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.529
 useful for the iphone 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.169
 That's why you worry again 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.939
 top psychotricks video same with the 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.029
 Usually it's the first trick 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.940
 since 17 so that one on one side 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.710
 only a few apps pack the folders 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.530
 can and the whole can be solved 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.210
 with course or a dealer that is 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.920
 in my case also very good at play 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.750
 was there then i had on the iphone 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.980
 really several pages to play 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.180
 then you do not even have to look where 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.399
 is that this game on which side 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
 and with one in front of your heart one has one 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.610
 much better overview, of course 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.469
 now the whole in the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.510
 Settings as we like 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.670
 you would like to have to adjust 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.530
 just pass by and there you can 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.440
 then activate how much and split 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.149
 then rank here on the iphone or im 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.979
 folder should be displayed 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.630
 I actually think so with 44 am 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.619
 best there you have it the most space 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.090
 and i can really recommend myself 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.090
 we come to the second tweet 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.080
 you already have up in the status bar 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.119
 I do not use the conventional ones 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.369
 battery indicator maybe you could 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.440
 this is the battery indicator as well 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.590
 while the mac is available you can do that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.030
 whole with the help of the trick alkaline 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.009
 But you also have to mac this 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.140
 Download battery they also serve 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 mac battery is also free 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.700
 installed and if the two 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.340
 you have downloaded then you go 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.729
 easy in the settings to oracle 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.890
 on 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.860
 and then you can choose the team 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.390
 further I have a second 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.610
 downloaded this is called life 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.200
 battery indicator also sees that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.569
 really nice as I think 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.759
 but i really like mac battery 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.959
 better come indeed already to the next 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.229
 war I really think that's right 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.940
 useful is the track data seven 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.220
 and maybe you know one or the other 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.259
 others already from earlier us persons 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.780
 With that you have the possibility to be 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.119
 Data volume now in the notification 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.319
 Center directly to let the show 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.120
 you just have to put it under 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.920
 activate messages 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 and then the whole thing is also in the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.650
 notification center 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.540
 I also find the presentation of this 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.580
 war very nice one has one 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.200
 month overview then to survey of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.450
 last seven days and then one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.739
 Survey of today in the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.019
 There are settings that should of course 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.950
 also some more 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.170
 setting options 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.090
 you just have to and the wii track 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.099
 data go and you can then here 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.160
 Enter his limit in my case 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.530
 that's one gigabyte or 1000 mb you have to 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.690
 you can give here in mb 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.120
 then you can still choose which 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.580
 month's day should start with the whole 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 to count and so on down here 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.360
 you still have to stop if he has a smaller one 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.290
 would like to have it displayed in the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.450
 new center 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.239
 but I find the normal big one 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.450
 vision clear and just better 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.579
 the next trend is ex ski 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.560
 a trick for the keyboard if I am 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.090
 Now just go to an app where 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.860
 the keyboard is needed as for 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.440
 example notes from then we'll see 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.819
 I now have a total of four pure and 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.950
 We'll see you in the first row 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.650
 have the numbers and the app here 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.780
 sign if I'm here now on 123 times 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.420
 g down on this button then we see 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.709
 Here , too, was another one 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.870
 I find this trick 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.359
 really very useful and you have to 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.920
 not always between the individual 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.900
 Changing keyboards then helps one 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.209
 really next day in everyday life 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.680
 tag is called becoming a participant 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.690
 now all the push messages the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.910
 you get it be messages e-mails 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.950
 or other miscellaneous push messages 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.880
 they are now only in the area of 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.930
 status bar status bar displayed 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.880
 Normally you get so one 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.989
 relatively large field where then the push 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.819
 message is displayed 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.650
 In this case, the whole stop is only on 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.090
 the status line I think the whole 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.700
 minimalistic and just kinda 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.190
 better and there you have a big one 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.630
 big field what you get in and yes 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.130
 I think it's very convenient 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.540
 Let's come to the last one 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.209
 Tweet from today's video 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.359
 this is called classic dog with it 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.420
 Now you are the classic ios here 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.980
 also under ios 7 with the team software 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.229
 mix as I have just here in cit 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.519
 If it's really good for you 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.169
 time I have installed the whole time 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.090
 and I think it's nice too 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.010
 if we have the classic ios dog here 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.979
 to have it in and not more transparent 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.900
 This bird dog is now in 17 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.880
 this is so is already 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.289
