run you're gonna break a few more

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
run you're gonna break a few more
tackles<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.239> you're<00:01:00.360> also<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.750> fumble

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
tackles but you're also your fumble

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
tackles but you're also your fumble
chance<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.380> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.649> increased<00:01:02.059> which

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
chance is going to be increased which

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
chance is going to be increased which
you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.600> convert<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.290> aggressive

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
setting and conversely we have the

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.870 
setting and conversely we have the
conservative<00:01:07.469> aspect<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> protect<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> ball

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
conservative aspect to protect the ball

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
conservative aspect to protect the ball
or<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.870> there<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.170> not

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
or you can go in there and you're not

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
or you can go in there and you're not
gonna<00:01:10.530> break<00:01:10.710> nearly<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.130> many<00:01:11.250> tackles<00:01:11.790> but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
gonna break nearly as many tackles but

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.410 
gonna break nearly as many tackles but
your<00:01:12.840> fumble<00:01:13.170> chance<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> extremely<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.420> on

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
your fumble chance is extremely well on

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
your fumble chance is extremely well on
the<00:01:15.630> defensive<00:01:16.110> side<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.130> works<00:01:17.310> in

the defensive side you know it works in

the same way where you know it's
aggressive<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.770> conservative<00:01:20.369> which

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
aggressive and it's conservative which

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
aggressive and it's conservative which
is<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.720> strip<00:01:22.290> ball<00:01:22.470> versus<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.460> know

plates<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.389> play<00:02:48.569> call<00:02:48.750> screen<00:02:48.989> they're

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
plates in the play call screen they're

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.110 
plates in the play call screen they're
linked<00:02:49.410> together<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.639> see<00:02:50.850> as

linked together and you can see as

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.970 
linked together and you can see as
you're<00:02:51.720> running<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.170> play<00:02:52.380> that's<00:02:52.709> linked<00:02:52.950> to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
you're running a play that's linked to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.530 
you're running a play that's linked to
another<00:02:53.160> one<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.639> running<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:53.940> successfully

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
another one and running it successfully

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.970 
another one and running it successfully
you're<00:02:55.200> starting<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> set<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.829> other

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you're starting to set up that other

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.500 
you're starting to set up that other
play<00:02:56.250> getting<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.670> ready<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.910> go<00:02:56.970> it'll<00:02:57.299> tell

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
play getting it ready to go it'll tell

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.509 
play getting it ready to go it'll tell
you<00:02:57.660> when<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:57.959> 100%<00:02:58.290> ready<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.370> this

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
you when it's 100% ready to go and this

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.680 
you when it's 100% ready to go and this
doesn't<00:02:59.730> mean<00:02:59.849> it'll<00:03:00.209> be<00:03:00.299> an<00:03:00.389> automatic

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
doesn't mean it'll be an automatic

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.089 
doesn't mean it'll be an automatic
touchdown<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.500> play<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.920> just

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
touchdown here on this play it just

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.740 
touchdown here on this play it just
means<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.940> defense<00:03:03.239> has<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.420> highest

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
means the defense has the highest

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.120 
means the defense has the highest
likelihood<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.200> being<00:03:04.380> faked<00:03:04.650> out<00:03:04.799> by<00:03:04.950> that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
likelihood of being faked out by that

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.920 
likelihood of being faked out by that
play<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.400> if<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.269> running<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.480> lot<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.720> dives

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
play so if you're running a lot of dives

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.229 
play so if you're running a lot of dives
it's<00:03:07.769> gonna<00:03:07.889> set<00:03:08.069> up<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> play-action<00:03:08.519> pass<00:03:08.819> and

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
it's gonna set up a play-action pass and

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.849 
it's gonna set up a play-action pass and
so<00:03:09.930> when<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.139> run<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.349> play<00:03:10.500> action<00:03:10.620> pass

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
so when you run that play action pass

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.250 
so when you run that play action pass
100%<00:03:11.790> set<00:03:11.940> up<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> good<00:03:12.959> chance<00:03:13.109> of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
100% set up you have a good chance of

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.449 
100% set up you have a good chance of
having<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.530> defense<00:03:13.829> gets<00:03:13.980> faked<00:03:14.160> out<00:03:14.310> by

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
having the defense gets faked out by

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.789 
having the defense gets faked out by
that<00:03:14.669> run<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.359> successfully<00:03:15.900> more<00:03:16.530> credits

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
that run that successfully more credits

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.229 
that run that successfully more credits
come<00:03:16.919> your<00:03:17.040> way<00:03:17.160> yeah<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:18.030> neat

open you know get a little coverage
one-on-one<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.130> outside<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.849> keep<00:03:33.090> rush

one-on-one on the outside and keep rush

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.240 
one-on-one on the outside and keep rush
it's<00:03:34.360> not<00:03:34.540> just<00:03:34.750> running<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.260> running<00:03:36.010> play<00:03:36.129> to

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
it's not just running a running play to

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.140 
it's not just running a running play to
set<00:03:36.400> up<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.549> play-action

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
set up a play-action

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.670 
set up a play-action
there<00:03:37.629> are<00:03:37.720> passing<00:03:38.079> plays<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.409> will<00:03:38.500> set<00:03:38.620> up

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
there are passing plays that will set up

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.470 
there are passing plays that will set up
other<00:03:38.860> passing<00:03:39.250> plays<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.670> routes<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.239> baits

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
other passing plays and routes and baits

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.000 
other passing plays and routes and baits
on<00:03:40.629> that<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.170> run<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.409> pass<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.680> play<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.860> set

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
on that you run a pass and play to set

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.960 
on that you run a pass and play to set
up<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.159> screen<00:03:42.459> pass

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
up a screen pass

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.729 
up a screen pass
you<00:03:43.299> have<00:03:43.480> runs<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.870> set<00:03:44.019> up<00:03:44.110> other<00:03:44.290> runs<00:03:44.590> I

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
you have runs that set up other runs I

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.490 
you have runs that set up other runs I
mean<00:03:44.860> there's<00:03:45.189> a<00:03:45.250> definite<00:03:46.239> variety<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.780> what

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
mean there's a definite variety of what

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.869 
mean there's a definite variety of what
it's<00:03:47.739> not<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:48.099> running<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.370> digest<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
it's not just running a digest of a

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.979 
it's not just running a digest of a
play-action<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.390> lot<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.629> variety<00:03:49.959> of

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
play-action there's a lot of variety of

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.899 
play-action there's a lot of variety of
what<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.319> can<00:03:50.530> set<00:03:50.769> up<00:03:50.799> actually<00:03:51.549> works<00:03:51.700> it

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
what you can set up actually works it

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.369 
what you can set up actually works it
works<00:03:52.060> backwards<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.629> right<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.049> mean<00:03:53.200> if

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
works backwards to right so I mean if

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.899 
works backwards to right so I mean if
you<00:03:53.920> know<00:03:54.010> if<00:03:54.099> you're<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> team<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.579> likes<00:03:54.670> to

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
you know if you're a team that likes to

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.059 
you know if you're a team that likes to
you<00:03:55.329> know<00:03:55.420> set<00:03:55.689> up<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.049> run<00:03:56.500> by<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.829> know

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
you know set up the run by you know

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.649 
you know set up the run by you know
using<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.519> play-action<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.060> know<00:03:58.480> because

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
using the play-action you know because

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.420 
using the play-action you know because
it's<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.930> idea<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.379> is<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.920> know<00:04:00.010> it's<00:04:00.129> it's

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430

other nice part too is you don't have a
time<00:04:37.330> limit<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:38.289> you<00:04:38.380> need<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.590> run<00:04:38.710> this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
time limit that you need to run this

time limit that you need to run this
play<00:04:39.070> that's<00:04:39.490> effectively<00:04:40.240> under<00:04:40.479> prevent

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
play that's effectively under prevent

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.540 
play that's effectively under prevent
setup<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.530> can<00:04:41.650> wait<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.070> hold<00:04:42.190> on<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.430> that

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
setup you can wait and hold on to that

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.700 
setup you can wait and hold on to that
play<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.060> use<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.389> when<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:43.570> need<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.080> it's
