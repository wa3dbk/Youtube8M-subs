00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but for the most part they're going to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
but for the most part they're going to
have<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> contraption<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.610> see

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
have a contraption like this as you see

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.430 
have a contraption like this as you see
just<00:00:45.090> need<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> Phillips<00:00:45.719> head<00:00:45.780> screwdriver

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
just need the Phillips head screwdriver

depending on your type of door there

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.270 
depending on your type of door there
could<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.840> anywhere<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.379> six<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> ten<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
could be anywhere from six to ten of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.020 
could be anywhere from six to ten of
these<00:00:56.370> guys<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.280> need<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> get

these guys so all you need to do is get
your<00:01:00.120> screwdriver<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> loosen<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.260 

once<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.170> loose<00:01:10.350> enough<00:01:10.910> they'll<00:01:11.910> swing

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
once it's loose enough they'll swing

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.930 
once it's loose enough they'll swing
down<00:01:12.480> and<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:14.160> should<00:01:14.190> be<00:01:14.520> able<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> pull<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
down and you should be able to pull the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.480 
down and you should be able to pull the
door<00:01:15.120> out

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.430 

so<00:01:20.240> when<00:01:20.420> you're<00:01:20.570> down<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.900> your<00:01:20.960> last<00:01:21.049> two

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
so when you're down to your last two

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.770 
so when you're down to your last two
screws<00:01:21.830> make<00:01:22.159> sure<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.970> hold<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.540> glass

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
screws make sure that you hold the glass

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.170 
screws make sure that you hold the glass
pane<00:01:24.049> in<00:01:24.290> it'd<00:01:25.040> be<00:01:25.250> possible<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:25.909> could

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
pane in it'd be possible that you could

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.820 
pane in it'd be possible that you could
unscrew<00:01:26.630> them<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.869> could<00:01:26.960> fall<00:01:27.200> break<00:01:27.590> you

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
unscrew them and it could fall break you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.440 
unscrew them and it could fall break you
know<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.220> mostly<00:01:28.580> made<00:01:28.729> up<00:01:28.880> out<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.270> plaques

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
know it's mostly made up out of plaques

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.540 
know it's mostly made up out of plaques
Plexiglas<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.680> shouldn't<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.250> problem

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
Plexiglas so shouldn't be a problem

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.830 
Plexiglas so shouldn't be a problem
there<00:01:31.810> but<00:01:32.810> still<00:01:33.140> safety<00:01:33.890> first<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.570> once<00:01:35.780> you

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
there but still safety first so once you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.930 
there but still safety first so once you
remove<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.259> glass<00:01:36.470> pane<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.340> next<00:01:37.580> step<00:01:37.729> is

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
remove the glass pane the next step is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.060 
remove the glass pane the next step is
you<00:01:38.270> just<00:01:38.540> set<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:38.899> somewhere<00:01:39.080> safe<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.830> get

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
you just set it somewhere safe and get

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.310 
you just set it somewhere safe and get
yourself<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.700> screen<00:01:41.030> door<00:01:44.259> putting<00:01:45.259> the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
yourself the screen door putting the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.540 
yourself the screen door putting the
screen<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:45.740> place<00:01:45.770> shouldn't<00:01:46.280> be<00:01:46.369> too<00:01:46.520> hard

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
screen in place shouldn't be too hard

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.790 
screen in place shouldn't be too hard
really<00:01:47.090> long<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.899> was<00:01:47.990> stored<00:01:48.229> properly<00:01:48.619> it

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
really long so it was stored properly it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.170 
really long so it was stored properly it
should<00:01:48.979> be<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> perfect<00:01:49.490> rectangle<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.119> you

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
should be a perfect rectangle and you

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.910 
should be a perfect rectangle and you
can<00:01:50.300> just<00:01:50.450> slide<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.810> right<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.110> just<00:01:51.710> make

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
can just slide it right in just make

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.560 
can just slide it right in just make
sure<00:01:52.070> all<00:01:52.100> your<00:01:52.490> brackets<00:01:52.940> are<00:01:53.090> turned<00:01:53.360> out<00:01:53.509> of

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
sure all your brackets are turned out of

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.100 
sure all your brackets are turned out of
the<00:01:53.720> way

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the way

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.260 
the way
otherwise<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.890> could<00:01:55.070> become<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.670> little

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
otherwise it could become a little

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.719 
otherwise it could become a little
harder<00:01:56.570> once<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.590> get<00:01:57.740> into<00:01:58.009> place<00:01:58.220> just<00:01:58.429> get

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
harder once you get into place just get

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.029 
harder once you get into place just get
one<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.720> brackets<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.200> screw<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:00.979> in

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
one of the brackets in screw it in

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.830 
one of the brackets in screw it in
you'll<00:02:01.700> have<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.940> go<00:02:02.060> too<00:02:02.119> tight<00:02:02.450> just<00:02:02.720> enough

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
you'll have to go too tight just enough

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.139 
you'll have to go too tight just enough
to<00:02:03.110> hold<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.470> little<00:02:03.649> bit<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:03.970> work<00:02:04.970> from

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
to hold it a little bit and work from

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.630 
to hold it a little bit and work from
