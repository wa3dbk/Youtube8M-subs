with<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> couple<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.629> new<00:02:36.780> lights<00:02:36.989> coming<00:02:37.260> back

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
with a couple of new lights coming back

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.110 
with a couple of new lights coming back
in<00:02:37.709> again<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:38.159> freshen<00:02:38.489> up<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.639> group<00:02:38.969> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
in again to freshen up the group you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.309 
in again to freshen up the group you
know<00:02:39.239> trying<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> rotate<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:40.019> get<00:02:40.109> as<00:02:40.200> much

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
know trying to rotate and get as much

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.679 
know trying to rotate and get as much
game<00:02:40.590> time<00:02:40.620> into<00:02:40.980> people<00:02:41.219> as<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.609> so<00:02:42.480> it's

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
game time into people as we can so it's

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.569 
game time into people as we can so it's
it's<00:02:43.109> gonna<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.409> big<00:02:43.560> ass<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:43.980> us<00:02:44.069> but<00:02:44.340> you

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
it's gonna be a big ass for us but you

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.890 
it's gonna be a big ass for us but you
know<00:02:44.760> we're<00:02:44.939> trying<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.239> build<00:02:45.629> on<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
know we're trying to build on the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.629 
know we're trying to build on the
momentum<00:02:46.019> from<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> cardiff<00:02:46.980> game<00:02:47.159> but<00:02:47.609> i

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
momentum from the cardiff game but i

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.369 
momentum from the cardiff game but i
think<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.939> key<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.269> us<00:02:48.389> will<00:02:48.629> be<00:02:48.659> in<00:02:48.930> in

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
think the key for us will be in in

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.399 
think the key for us will be in in
dealing<00:02:49.889> with<00:02:50.040> their<00:02:50.310> unstructured<00:02:50.819> game

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
dealing with their unstructured game

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.439 
dealing with their unstructured game
they're<00:02:52.409> looking<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.889> run<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.310> run<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.299> ball

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
they're looking to run and run the ball

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.750 
they're looking to run and run the ball
from<00:02:54.599> anywhere<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.169> know<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.609> have

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
from anywhere you know and if we have

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.759 
from anywhere you know and if we have
any<00:02:56.879> loose<00:02:57.120> kicks<00:02:57.480> any<00:02:57.810> any<00:02:58.169> opportunities

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
any loose kicks any any opportunities

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.439 
any loose kicks any any opportunities
that<00:02:58.859> turn<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.189> ball<00:02:59.340> over<00:02:59.370> or<00:02:59.849> one<00:03:00.030> when

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:00.449 
that turn the ball over or one when

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:01.939 
that turn the ball over or one when
we're<00:03:00.599> not<00:03:00.719> switched<00:03:01.019> on<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.560> think<00:03:01.769> they'll

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
we're not switched on I think they'll

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.860 
we're not switched on I think they'll
