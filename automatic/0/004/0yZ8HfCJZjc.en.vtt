00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.989
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.630
 balance and we are in the last hour 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.759
 of playstation network and its fall to 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.089
 world level that has occurred during 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.519
 tonight this is the last hour if they are 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.710
 and it has been pronounced and as you can read 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 well you know they are aware 9 of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 that are the users are 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.950
 experiencing startup problems 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.110
 session on playstation network and how 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.400
 it does not always seem like they do not have a 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.890
 copy past 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 the engineers are investigating and that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.170
 any incident as it will communicate 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.570
 no more no less do they come to say that in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 page fault detector as 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 you can see the critical part of the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.079
 reports has already passed and it is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.629
 decreasing this means that it is 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.789
 good problems are becoming less and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 there are people who can enter 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 in different parts of the world not over 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.569
 all some people in Argentina told me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 that I could enter right away I who 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.579
 Spain is 3 in the morning I still 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.769
 I can not enter but I guess it will be 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 in my area and there will be people who like 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.710
 that they leave to these things are so 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.990
 complicated and so complex 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.990
 I could not tell you in which part of the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 world you can connect if you have suffered 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.570
 they are and an attack of desire not because I do not know 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.430
 if we will know, we are followed by any group 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.220
 sheet that is going to be the pronounce to the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 respect certainly no one has said anything 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.770
 still and good the other information 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.600
 official that we have at the moment is 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.759
 what you are seeing on screen is not 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.009
 well that playstation network now 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.440
 that is offline on the official page and 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.229
 that is the official information there 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.300
 now so I would ask for calm 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.860
 tranquility and that I think during 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.960
 the next hours this is going to 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.200
 solve if not then we will be before 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.140
 another serious case and they are and so should 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.050
 make him look because he is losing 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.479
 user confidence and this is 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.039
 quite serious I do not believe a hug 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.110
 thank you all for being there for 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.830
 trust me like and favorites and we 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.830
 we see in the next
