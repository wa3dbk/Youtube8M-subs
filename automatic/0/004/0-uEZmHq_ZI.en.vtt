of the game is puzzle oriented
february's<00:04:47.170> we<00:04:47.350> really<00:04:47.590> would<00:04:48.250> look<00:04:48.370> at<00:04:48.490> a

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
february's we really would look at a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.090 
february's we really would look at a
moment<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.480> try<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.020> decide<00:04:50.350> what<00:04:50.770> gameplay

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
moment and try to decide what gameplay

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.770 
moment and try to decide what gameplay
would<00:04:51.220> work<00:04:51.340> best<00:04:51.550> for<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.210> moment<00:04:52.420> that's

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
would work best for that moment that's

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.270 
would work best for that moment that's
something<00:04:53.080> that<00:04:53.110> Roberta<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.620> cancer<00:04:53.950> shared
