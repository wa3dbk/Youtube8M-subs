00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
shutoff valve right down there if you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.269 
shutoff valve right down there if you

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
and but it's just got kind of a little

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.929 
and but it's just got kind of a little
handle<00:01:48.439> on<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.739> and<00:01:48.889> when<00:01:49.279> it's<00:01:49.429> in<00:01:49.639> line<00:01:49.909> with

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.010 
the pipe that means that it's on and all
we<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.239> to<00:01:53.359> shut<00:01:53.569> off<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.719> water<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.349> grab<00:01:54.770> it

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
we do to shut off the water is grab it

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.389 
we do to shut off the water is grab it
turn<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.409> usually<00:01:57.739> they're<00:01:57.889> pretty<00:01:58.039> tough

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
turn it and usually they're pretty tough

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:07.660 
turn it and usually they're pretty tough
to<00:01:58.549> turn

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.469 

especially<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:08.789> you're<00:02:08.940> trying<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> avoid

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
especially when you're trying to avoid

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.720 
especially when you're trying to avoid
all<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.560> spiders<00:02:12.800> your<00:02:13.800> head<00:02:13.980> did<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.370> way<00:02:14.580> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
all the spiders your head did my way and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.490 
all the spiders your head did my way and
I<00:02:14.850> can't<00:02:15.120> see

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I can't see

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.570 
I can't see
I<00:02:17.420> could<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.600> grab<00:02:18.750> our<00:02:18.959> sprinkler<00:02:19.530> turn<00:02:20.370> off

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
I could go grab our sprinkler turn off

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.190 
I could go grab our sprinkler turn off
but<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.850> figured<00:02:21.209> I'd<00:02:21.330> show<00:02:21.600> people<00:02:22.020> with

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
but I figured I'd show people with

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.120 
but I figured I'd show people with
something<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.739> they<00:02:22.860> know<00:02:23.310> how<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.550> find<00:02:25.130> but

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
something but they know how to find but

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.400 
something but they know how to find but
so<00:02:26.459> there<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:26.760> go

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
so there we go

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.170 
so there we go
so<00:02:28.410> turn<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.100> are<00:02:29.310> our<00:02:29.670> water<00:02:30.000> is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
so turn like that are our water is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.720 
so turn like that are our water is
turned<00:02:30.450> off<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.890> I'm<00:02:32.040> gonna<00:02:32.340> turn<00:02:32.550> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
prefer the sprinkler method to turn off

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.259 
prefer the sprinkler method to turn off
the<00:03:58.680> water<00:03:58.920> but<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.610> case<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.940> don't<00:04:00.030> have

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
the water but in case you don't have

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.580 
the water but in case you don't have
sprinkler<00:04:00.660> system--and<00:04:01.019> have<00:04:01.230> one<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.470> those

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
sprinkler system--and have one of those
