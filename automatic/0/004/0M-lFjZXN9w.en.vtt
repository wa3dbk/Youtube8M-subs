 we have three new evolutions that I 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.079
 they look very very spectacular about 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.350
 will love pikachu from the picacho rocker things

 end we'll see now we get there 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.340
 probably tomorrow or the past is a 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.129
 special video talking about the mega 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 evolutions that we have left to know in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.670
 pokemon blond mega sapphire alpha I know that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.109
 you are tuned to tomorrow probably what 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.280
 will be saying on twitter and such because 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.989
 I really want to make this video 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.370
 just like I want to make you one 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 that I promised to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 the mega and ferocious blond pokemon map 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.650
 alpha that has some that others or 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.119
 some other secrets that do not 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.009
 we know what they are but what looks 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 to be very, very interesting 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.240
 face the remakes so let's go let's go 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.100
 there and here we see here that I do not know 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 talk here we're going to mega altaria with 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.180
 this altar evolution evidently 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.790
 which is dragon fairy and lévesque and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.110
 beautiful ah how beautiful are tasks 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.750
 sincerely this mega altar and better 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 said the truth is that quite obvious 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 that was drago nothing sincerely I do not know 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 why I did not sing I could have 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 a mega evolution and the great evolution 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.259
 will obviously win the fairy type because 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.970
 is that they would jump yes I think that yes 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.130
 interweave shares there is the type 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.750
 alda fairy would not have been dragon type 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.490
 if not with that been kind now we're going to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.350
 see me one hundred percent because 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.550
 altar already has more fairy than dragon 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.990
 mica with the conapro bona altaria follows 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.960
 being a flying dragon and in this case 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.700
 altar already wins the fairy dragon type with the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 skin skill fer and here what it does 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
 is that any attack of type type 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 normal be made of type now like 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.740
 who had that ability will earn me 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.929
 bodies now has it altar and therefore 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.880
 a force a tackle or something like that happens 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.280
 of the normal type thanks to the skill 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.060
 of the typical type will do very, very 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.979
 but that very 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.610
 interesting increases your attack is on my 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.400
 area and weighs 20 6 kilos and measures 15 meters 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.099
 now he eats gallopín and is open 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.500
 surprise honestly here lewis do not know 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.989
 you put a pokémon that you give me and 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.700
 without grief or glory for the games going 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.690
 we put it a little very good is not what 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.900
 I will have the equipment etc. and so on 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.330
 but in the mega it puts it like that without more 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.040
 point they plant it and the truth is that it's cool 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.860
 rather the spray of mola quite the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.970
 design of this mega puts it a little bit 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.739
 I do not know why he has no forehead 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 I like it very much but still the design 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.430
 it seems that in game there are also slight 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 it looks pretty pretty and that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.190
 mega the public is the evolution the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.739
 evolution better said of him what pum and that 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.630
 it is normal to fight and have the ability 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.549
 intrepid that what it does is that it hits 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.560
 it hits us so much with the normal guy 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.930
 as with the ghost type to the pokemon 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.250
 of type with forgiveness with both the chili 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.650
 both with the normal type and with the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.599
 type fight hits the type pokemon 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 ghost thing if the skill 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.080
 Intrepid would be impossible because he 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.000
 affects this megalopolis increases its 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.080
 attack and special attack therefore gives me 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.269
 to me that this mega puts it and will hit 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.480
 some web in some good milk I shit 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.090
 in the area and weighs 28.3 kilos and measures 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.540
 to three meters and we go with the plate 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.390
 strong quotes from the news here 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.360
 we have the evolution of salamis in 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.349
 theory and problemente upload a video 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.700
 normally after confirming the 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.470
 racing sport that the corocoro 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
 cetera etcetera pokemon on your channel 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.980
 youtube shows information about everything 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.440
 said the corocoro and maybe with something 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.120
 more a detail more etc. etcetera 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.099
 gameplay information all everything everything 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.230
 what is being said and with him with 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.239
 real game images then 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.190
 probably when pokemon goes up a 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.290
 video of them will try to make a video 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.329
 teaching megas to the mind inside 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.280
 of the game because the esscan does not look 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.680
 specifically well to this mega room 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
 mens so I'll try I'll try good 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 I will try to upload those types of videos but 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.910
 Do not catch me copying intent or anything 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.069
 like that but let's go for the mind 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.840
 be Monday on Tuesday or Wednesday 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.269
 at the latest you know that always 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.370
 pokemon upload information and then a 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.410
 information a couple or three days later 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.120
 of what goes up or after the 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.980
 magazine colo colo so to speak here 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.959
 we go to megas to the mind I do not like 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.060
 a lot of design and quite with opinions 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.560
 very contrastadas on twitter many people 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.850
 who likes other people who do not like 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.330
 nothing 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.400
 like a plane enough to megan I do not know that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.980
 they are doing because they are doing 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.660
 revolutions like metallized fixed in 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.610
 mega beat are my me galati is good 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.590
 that the same pokemon is given cause 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.630
 megas only is like an airplane so 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.090
 say it very very weird indeed this mega 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.230
 at least wins wins in defense does not win 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.910
 in attack or special attack and in 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.640
 speed or person well tell you will win 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.720
 speed does not win in defense and we go with 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.610
 it hits me to the mind that is the mega 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.990
 evolution of san mamés that conserves its 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.730
 guys is to think I was going to be kind 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.170
 steel why that was it does not look like 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.420
 it seems metallic to assist but not 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.850
 he keeps his flying dragon types and 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.770
 he has the celestial skin skill that 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.930
 that makes celestial skin is the following 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.880
 stability alters all movements 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.830
 of the normal type that the pokemon uses to 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.050
 that are flying type instead is 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.250
 saying tack goes from being of normal type 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.260
 to be of type grad there are many 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.340
 lately there are quite a few skills 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.680
 who do this 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.180
 113 pokemon that has the skin skill 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.340
 celeste is mega pink be also 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.080
 quite curious but there it is and as you 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.760
 I say so that this one can create type 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.680
 flying instead increasing your power 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.530
 by 30 percent if they are offensive it is 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.120
 saying tackle increases apart from being of 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.100
 type of flying type in this 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.970
 channel is in favor of that the mind and 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.500
 gains its power by 30% apart if they are 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.060
 offensive pretty curious this moment 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.889
 can not beat the pokemon to no 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.750
 accents in triple combats on the contrary 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.760
 that the genuine flying type pokemon 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.590
 it's a good thing that is not very 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.750
 there but we do not already know but 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.610
 Salame the boy is quite curious 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.590
 I honestly do not like the design very much 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.180
 but I think that in game you will see 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.400
 much better than what we see in the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.050
 sprite of the croc magazine or not 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.190
 They also confirm that within the 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.190
 contests because we're going to meet 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.889
 a girl who called herself looked and that very 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.210
 probably participate in some 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.979
 another contest that we participate 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.840
 I think it's going to be in the last 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.280
 contest in the expert contest as well 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.930
 say it although you still do not know if it's going to 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.820
 have expert competitions competitions 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.199
 level in theory there must be contests 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.490
 level or the same thing they do 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.320
 completely different because they are 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.660
 getting enough personality and 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.370
 Pretty hard on the shoulders contests 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.340
 we still do not know how they are going to be and I have 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.830
 I hope many of you want it to be 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.210
 know something new and see the gameplay of 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.740
 the contests sincerely very likely 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.000
 Ente for the week next week 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.919
 not for next month with the magazine 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.700
 of the corocoro finally confirm 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.890
 the photos 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.000
 of picacho when changing the clothes 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:41.190
 we remember friend to pikachu forgiveness to al 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.710
 picada madama al madame pikachu al mal 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.780
 to the rocker itchy a super weird thing and 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.160
 it seems that each pokemon each picacho
