initially<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.020> was<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.259> little<00:01:35.530> bit<00:01:36.030> confused

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
initially I was a little bit confused

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.090 
initially I was a little bit confused
because<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.140> don't<00:01:38.320> understand<00:01:38.740> much<00:01:38.890> about

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
because I don't understand much about

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.040 
because I don't understand much about
the<00:01:39.250> technology<00:01:39.550> you're<00:01:40.300> very<00:01:40.570> aware<00:01:40.720> that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
the technology you're very aware that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.920 
the technology you're very aware that
you've<00:01:41.200> got<00:01:41.410> 60<00:01:42.280> cameras<00:01:43.060> at<00:01:43.420> all<00:01:43.630> times

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
you've got 60 cameras at all times

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.230 
you've got 60 cameras at all times
picking<00:01:44.350> up<00:01:44.470> everything<00:01:45.009> from<00:01:45.310> every<00:01:45.670> angle<00:01:45.850> I

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
picking up everything from every angle I

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.270 
picking up everything from every angle I
mean<00:01:46.360> there's<00:01:46.509> no<00:01:46.660> place<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.960> hide<00:01:47.280> anything

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
mean there's no place to hide anything

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.810 
mean there's no place to hide anything
so<00:01:49.180> I'm<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.330> series<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.960> dots<00:01:50.439> then<00:01:50.979> what<00:01:51.670> they

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
so I'm a series of dots then what they

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
so I'm a series of dots then what they
are<00:01:51.939> doing<00:01:52.390> is<00:01:52.630> building<00:01:52.869> up<00:01:53.170> an<00:01:53.320> entire

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
are doing is building up an entire

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.340 
are doing is building up an entire
virtual<00:01:54.729> map<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.840> emotional

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
virtual map of you and the emotional

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.750 
virtual map of you and the emotional
input<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.830> everything<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.340> you're<00:01:57.460> giving

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
input and everything that you're giving

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.730 
input and everything that you're giving
them<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.299> once<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.600> realize<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.960> suddenly

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
them and once you realize that suddenly

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.080 
them and once you realize that suddenly
you<00:01:59.860> think<00:02:00.070> well<00:02:00.189> this<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.430> magic<00:02:00.820> suit

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
you think well this is a magic suit

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.580 
you think well this is a magic suit
because<00:02:01.420> once<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.750> have<00:02:01.900> this<00:02:02.049> ridiculous

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
because once I have this ridiculous

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.450 
because once I have this ridiculous
outfit<00:02:03.100> on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
fun as I can possibly get out of it the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.860 
fun as I can possibly get out of it the
interesting<00:02:12.280> thing<00:02:12.700> about<00:02:12.790> motion<00:02:13.450> capture

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
interesting thing about motion capture

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.569 
interesting thing about motion capture
is<00:02:14.019> how<00:02:14.290> liberating<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.100> for<00:02:15.280> actors

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
is how liberating it is for actors

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.699 
is how liberating it is for actors
because<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.060> play<00:02:16.269> anything<00:02:16.690> you're<00:02:17.410> not

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
because you can play anything you're not

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.460 
because you can play anything you're not
restricted<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.400> your<00:02:19.120> own<00:02:19.480> physicality<00:02:20.049> your

own face you are allowed using this

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.600 
own face you are allowed using this
medium<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.010> go<00:02:24.600> anyway<00:02:25.630> motion<00:02:26.350> capture<00:02:26.610> seems

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
medium to go anyway motion capture seems

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.550 
medium to go anyway motion capture seems
to<00:02:27.790> really<00:02:28.120> capture<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.660> essence<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
to really capture the essence of the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560 
to really capture the essence of the
movement<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.040> much<00:02:30.340> more<00:02:30.670> than<00:02:30.910> what<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> normal

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
movement so much more than what a normal

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.300 
movement so much more than what a normal
camera<00:02:32.140> usually<00:02:32.440> can

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.040 

technology<00:02:38.310> nowadays<00:02:38.460> does<00:02:38.970> allow<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.420> to

of raising eyebrows and frowning that
kind<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.860> thing<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.640> take<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:50.940> data

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
kind of thing we have to take that data

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.320 
kind of thing we have to take that data
