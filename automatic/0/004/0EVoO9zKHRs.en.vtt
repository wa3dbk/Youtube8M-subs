00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.770
 ahrensburg alexy welcome me here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.960
 another consequence of because of the a1 in 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.099
 fifa 10 ultimate team being really gone 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.900
 in league one can not call it 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 Definitely another episode of 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 fifa because I will not be me now 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.990
 do ligaspiele but individual games 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.580
 and show you that all league 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.590
 Disease is that I am constantly on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'm just going to rack up on my players 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 partly nothing can be there already something 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.630
 can happen is that I realize that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.670
 it is almost the demonstration effect so if 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 the fifa play and record by the way 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.880
 then it's absolutely me because I'm 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 probably somehow so here towards the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 small switch and then 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.040
 it just does not work anymore 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.270
 Well, first of all we lose 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.600
 not the long time but catch 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.770
 Let's just have a look 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.059
 French team mostly up to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.010
 a single player is one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.660
 French team what to expect 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 not high chemistry either are not one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.649
 very high rating and against such a team 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.329
 should be theoretically possible such 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.730
 We'll get away again and again 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.530
 in the a 1 as an opponent but against the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.489
 but it does not always work 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.489
 at last rest 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:08.630
 and there we are again so Ronaldo 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 can do that 1 0 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.270
 100 after 16 minutes and we want 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 directly refuel and with the 2 0 after 19 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
 minutes 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.799
 he still had to run, yes, well, Ronaldo 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.799
 in the middle with you and have my god 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.590
 ok i love you so much you can 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:44.829
 say you do not find it included 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:47.959
 21 08 33 minutes and with the 3 to 1 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.189
 and let's do one more normally 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.719
 that is really just the cream 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.289
 maybe a two- goal but me 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:02:00.439
 have in part eight goals and six goals 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:07.329
 by ronaldo on it also post 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.329
 Shit 31 to be preserved is expandable 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.430
 age the whole with shaky individual 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:22.069
 but not here 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:24.730
 there will still fit in so luke the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.829
 is actually rather weak player 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.360
 What kind of pass was we by the way 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.810
 on normal fits pressed no pass 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.810
 finals 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.190
 oh my god through there very difficult 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.700
 went 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.700
 that was it 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.340
 against was burner and my god is old 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.700
 is that your serious about recording 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.200
 not at once I myself cashed it 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.520
 properly disabled that is the worst 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.970
 goalkeeper I ever had 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.739
 alone like customs kwp issues on its 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.780
 do not stop valbuena 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:10.700
 because where is he 20 feet tall and one meter tall 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:12.709
 will probably be 0 2 kilo times 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.000
 in turn, is to monument with which the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.950
 game is relatively easy if you 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.459
 then such enemies then get 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.320
 questioned one passenger be genuine is 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:30.440
 slow as soon as the ball has against though 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:39.940
 but this time no reason to fret 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:41.930
 we still lead and it does not work that way 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.510
 Zimmermann the goal on the one 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:50.150
 Distancing hits gets the completely well 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.250
 nothing to complain about then have age 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.390
 we get a ball in the felt 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.430
 went through the goalkeeper again 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.530
 then we have the balinger once 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.989
 prevail against the whole defender 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.579
 can plus here again the cashed 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:08.329
 worst parts of the story of 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:09.459
 fifa and now he was as none 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.930
 idea 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.329
 defenders of them this one of 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.380
 madrid of those did not know each other 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.380
 set against fire 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.110
 this direction 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.570
 Ronaldo does not do that thing 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.680
 Nice match about five to four in the end 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.620
 or 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.080
 it is not over yet you know her 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.310
 fifa knows unfortunately 54 is but rather 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.050
 individual matches that I me now 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.030
 not really hoping because it was 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.740
 just about ran as well as in 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.420
 the league just stops me in the end 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.170
 won and the second against 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.820
 many 80s themes a strong one 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:57.860
 Bundesliga team in any case with him 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:05:00.560
 on that jesus in shape to and 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.760
 make wester is westermann westermann 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.540
 is just westermann I have to do it 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:10.070
 do not explain otherwise and Westermann was 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.120
 in between is not 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.710
 He went in but now he goes in 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.230
 because if you did not intervene 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.610
 so if western man is in between she is 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.210
 near the ball then go there 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.210
 not pure either 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.110
 but you are serious 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.290
 you have westermann so valued 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.310
 technical team just very crass 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:36.650
 japan that means it is with him left 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.340
 the city's brazilians so one is 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.680
 him with barclays are 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.600
 had something just has white jerseys 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.710
 had chosen red okay that will 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.480
 now a bit hard to recognize 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.790
 probably also for you have me 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.910
 also very impossible at all 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.800
 recognize players and lukas where 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.690
 lukas i just thought he was 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.460
 Actually, it's pretty shitty then 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.940
 had made the last two goals 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.140
 and why do they all quaff that way now ? 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.490
 in hopefully one opponent who does not 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.250
 could be a pretty strong one too 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.250
 Team 88er Appreciation Louis 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.690
 lewandowski almost does not care if the team 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.510
 so we think I have a serious one 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.740
 matches because the really damn strong 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.090
 are and bundesliga teams in general 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.320
 I have strong ones to say myself 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.320
 always very happy to play 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.230
 yes, I knew that he went in 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:40.070
 directly as she used to shoot me 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:42.170
 knew he was going inside what the fuck 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.730
 that was somehow too fast me 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:49.480
 was still there really perfect my god 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.480
 shoot it too 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:10.960
 why do not you have me one time 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.960
 explain why there was no elfmeter there 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:22.610
 what what what what are you doing xbox it 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.030
 time for an update is great 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.710
 is that this beautiful 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.910
 I say goodbye 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.320
 no game is lost a word 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.890
