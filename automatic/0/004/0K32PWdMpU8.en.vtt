00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
pretty dry it doesn't take very long and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.610 
pretty dry it doesn't take very long and
I'm<00:03:22.000> just<00:03:22.239> kind<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.569> brushing<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.110> hair<00:03:23.260> flat

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620

down<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.129> head<00:03:24.370> while<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.670> blow-dry<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.239> in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
down to my head while I blow-dry it in

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.180 
down to my head while I blow-dry it in
the<00:03:25.660> direction<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.379> want<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.830> lay<00:03:26.980> down

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.959 

and<00:03:45.349> it's<00:03:45.799> easier<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.219> tell<00:03:46.430> when<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.730> hair<00:03:46.879> is

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:46.969 
and it's easier to tell when the hair is

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.819 
and it's easier to tell when the hair is
about<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.420> be<00:03:47.540> dry<00:03:47.840> when<00:03:48.230> you're<00:03:48.469> doing<00:03:48.680> on
