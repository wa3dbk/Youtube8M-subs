capitalizing on college has the

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.380 
capitalizing on college has the
functions<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.039> what<00:00:18.310> ranges<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:18.970> planes<00:00:19.240> of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
functions and what ranges and planes of

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.570 
functions and what ranges and planes of
motion<00:00:19.420> and<00:00:19.810> functions<00:00:20.230> best<00:00:20.440> and<00:00:21.100> sometimes

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
motion and functions best and sometimes

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.790 
motion and functions best and sometimes
the<00:00:21.700> best<00:00:21.880> way<00:00:22.000> to<00:00:22.120> manipulate<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.990> is<00:00:23.260> to

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
the best way to manipulate that is to

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.580 
the best way to manipulate that is to
use<00:00:23.920> two<00:00:24.130> movements<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.990> Kevin's<00:00:26.380> going<00:00:26.500> to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
use two movements so Kevin's going to

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:51.420 
use two movements so Kevin's going to
show<00:00:26.740> us<00:00:26.920> he's<00:00:27.460> going<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.730> start<00:00:28.000> with<00:00:50.340> look<00:00:51.340> at

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
show us he's going to start with look at

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.530 
show us he's going to start with look at
that<00:00:51.550> breaking<00:00:51.940> motion

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
that breaking motion

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.959 
that breaking motion
awesome<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.469> you<00:00:53.559> get<00:00:53.710> all<00:00:53.950> that<00:00:54.130> activation

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
awesome so you get all that activation

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.220 
awesome so you get all that activation

the flat dumbbell press feet up and he

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.150 
the flat dumbbell press feet up and he
comes<00:01:09.820> above<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.240> eyes

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.830 

you're<00:01:14.160> gonna<00:01:14.280> blast<00:01:14.610> those<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.210> again<00:01:15.660> we're

worked which is from the cleavage out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.920 
worked which is from the cleavage out
not<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.820> outside<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.660> you<00:01:21.780> would

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
get with bench presses beautiful

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
get with bench presses beautiful
beautiful<00:01:24.570> combination<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> works<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
beautiful combination that works the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.910 
beautiful combination that works the
function<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> chest<00:01:26.750> together<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.710> it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
function of the chest together and it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.140 
function of the chest together and it's
a<00:01:28.980> great<00:01:29.190> finishing<00:01:29.850> combination<00:01:31.970> feels<00:01:32.970> good

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a great finishing combination feels good

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.560 
a great finishing combination feels good
it's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> big<00:01:34.080> difference<00:01:34.230> between<00:01:35.300> doing<00:01:36.300> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's a big difference between doing that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's a big difference between doing that
the<00:01:36.870> bigger<00:01:37.080> with<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.620> dumbbell<00:01:37.980> press<00:01:38.220> first

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the bigger with the dumbbell press first

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.510 
the bigger with the dumbbell press first
and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.570> finishing<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> fly<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.370> get

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and then finishing with the fly you get

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.090 
and then finishing with the fly you get
that<00:01:41.670> nice<00:01:42.510> stretch<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.830> full

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that nice stretch and the full

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.340 
that nice stretch and the full
contraction<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> cables<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:46.140> need

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
contraction of the cables don't need

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.750 
contraction of the cables don't need
super<00:01:46.650> heavy<00:01:46.860> dumbbells<00:01:47.280> either<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.700> if

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
super heavy dumbbells either so if

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:59.660 
super heavy dumbbells either so if
someone<00:01:48.000> does<00:01:48.150> have<00:01:58.340> that's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> great

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
someone does have that's a great

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.960 
someone does have that's a great
