00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.380
 with staff 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.710
 like some of the forum 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.139
 and other friends have already joined 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.219
 that month to bring 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.219
 I had problems with my playstation 3 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.990
 ox drive 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.770
 problems that faced other users and the wine 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.269
 braga and that's exactly it from here 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.269
 Can you see his house? 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.929
 Ticiane 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.550
 But I managed to buy 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.220
 the people of china 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.270
 anything 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.740
 tse has reached this point with 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.510
 was very good 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.400
 a friend introduced me 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.920
 I bought 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.540
 and it did not even come all right 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.330
 no problem only 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.470
 replaced ev 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 the degree of difficulty of the installation 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.690
 I remember choosing 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 just have patience we think it's right 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 hc had you disassemble question again 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 What I do not think is an error 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.240
 playstation 3 now running 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 in the text on the screen already detected disk before nor detected 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.130
 I hope that I 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.860
 get yourself included pushing now for a longer time, huh? 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.490
 say so for a while 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.330
 not as good as or 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.010
 the old generation 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 issued checks borges 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.330
 even some playstation 2 models ignored it 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.510
 long enough that the current bridge generation 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.510
 playstation 3 after today's problems 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 the pilates box 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.070
 the red price problems that I still have not had 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 And I hope you do not have 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.110
 It's complicated saving the Wii 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 It's just that I think 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.280
 the only one that did not show great failures there 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.330
 with these people, you know 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.730
 but that's it 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.860
 if he needs help 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.059
 send a message 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.059

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.079
