00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
air now what you can do is these Honda

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.620 
air now what you can do is these Honda
valves<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:24.140> see<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> Honda<00:00:25.859> Vail

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.000 

yeah<00:00:32.200> see<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.770> Honda<00:00:33.190> Vail<00:00:33.370> it's<00:00:34.210> flat<00:00:34.840> on<00:00:35.350> the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
yeah see the Honda Vail it's flat on the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.750 
yeah see the Honda Vail it's flat on the
top<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.750> stronger<00:00:38.140> valve<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:40.780> there's<00:00:41.170> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
top it's a stronger valve then there's a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.760 
top it's a stronger valve then there's a
cupped<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:43.180> know<00:00:43.330> like<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:45.090> cuff<00:00:46.090> like<00:00:46.770> well

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
cupped you know like that cuff like well

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.790 
cupped you know like that cuff like well
you<00:00:47.860> know<00:00:47.980> what<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.160> mean<00:00:48.430> you've<00:00:48.610> seen<00:00:48.820> them

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you know what I mean you've seen them

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.110 
you know what I mean you've seen them
these<00:00:50.800> are<00:00:50.980> stronger<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:51.790> know<00:00:51.940> what

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
these are stronger but you know what

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.920 
these are stronger but you know what
without<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.780> material<00:00:53.820> being<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.840> the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
without that material being with the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.720 
without that material being with the
more<00:00:56.170> material<00:00:56.770> there<00:00:56.980> that's<00:00:57.280> going<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.580> add

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
more material there that's going to add

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.450 
more material there that's going to add
some<00:00:57.760> more<00:00:58.180> compression<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.140> engine<00:00:59.680> note

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
some more compression to the engine note

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.520 
some more compression to the engine note
not<00:01:00.820> noticeably<00:01:01.510> but<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.020> not<00:01:02.260> going<00:01:02.440> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
not noticeably but it's not going to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.100 
not noticeably but it's not going to
take<00:01:02.710> compression<00:01:03.280> away<00:01:03.780> activity<00:01:04.780> would<00:01:04.930> go

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
take compression away activity would go

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.649 
take compression away activity would go
to<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.470> that's<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:06.040> concave<00:01:06.610> sort<00:01:07.060> about<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
to the that's it concave sort about and

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.420 
to the that's it concave sort about and
there's<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.229> part<00:01:11.500> number<00:01:11.860> if<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.040> wanted<00:01:12.310> to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
there's the part number if you wanted to

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:22.140 
there's the part number if you wanted to
get<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.040> intake<00:01:19.920> take<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:21.220> piece<00:01:21.940> of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
get that's the intake take a piece of

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.039 
get that's the intake take a piece of
this<00:01:22.360> stuff<00:01:23.760> it's<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.820> pretty<00:01:25.060> hard<00:01:25.390> stuff<00:01:25.810> or

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
this stuff it's a pretty hard stuff or

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.469 
this stuff it's a pretty hard stuff or
sandpaper<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.460> then<00:01:27.670> you<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.210> take

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
sandpaper and then you can just take

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.719 
sandpaper and then you can just take
your<00:01:28.510> finger<00:01:28.690> in<00:01:29.290> there<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:30.220> just<00:01:30.490> go<00:01:30.700> like

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
your finger in there and just go like

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.539 
your finger in there and just go like
this<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.500> I'll<00:01:32.830> just<00:01:33.130> take<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:34.210> off

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this and then I'll just take that off

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.399 
this and then I'll just take that off
it's<00:01:36.549> pretty<00:01:36.909> braced<00:01:37.299> up<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:37.990> don't<00:01:38.049> know<00:01:38.229> what

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
it's pretty braced up I don't know what

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:47.240 
it's pretty braced up I don't know what
it<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.680> it's<00:01:38.890> pretty<00:01:39.159> big<00:01:42.570> 104<00:01:43.570> it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.030 

that's<00:03:53.250> why<00:03:53.460> my<00:03:54.020> stop<00:03:55.020> cuts<00:03:55.290> faster<00:03:55.830> than

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
that's why my stop cuts faster than

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.110 
that's why my stop cuts faster than
yours<00:03:57.950> doesn't<00:03:58.950> really<00:03:59.130> matter<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.670> looks

on<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.510> exhaust<00:04:00.870> ports<00:04:01.350> because<00:04:01.680> they're<00:04:01.860> all

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
on the exhaust ports because they're all

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.920 
on the exhaust ports because they're all
from<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.280> carbon<00:04:02.760> in<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.970> way<00:04:03.150> an<00:04:03.750> hour

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
from the carbon in the way an hour

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.449 
from the carbon in the way an hour
anyway<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.840> will<00:04:07.200> help<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.709> carbon<00:04:08.190> is

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
anyway but this will help the carbon is

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.870 
anyway but this will help the carbon is
