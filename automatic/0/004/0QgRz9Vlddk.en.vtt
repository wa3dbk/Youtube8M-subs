 and how can they see 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.810
 as you can see loréfice I do not look for ups 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.380
 is very good 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 or other examples of violating these odors can be computed and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 I show them 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 others on the computer in the examples can be for example 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.870
 this 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.870
 what I have here is a video that is on youtube 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.350
 example stop 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.680
 clear without words 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 for example that hand the proforma 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.190

 an injection and so on 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.130
 Well, what I love covers the sectoral 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.350
 we're just going to veto a program that I found this page 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.840
 good the creator is the one on this page 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.250
 that amates pool and saw art 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.330
 breeding and chor 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.310
 that they kiss 5 point 1 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280
 I know I will be totally 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.479
 the barsa lind this page so that they visit it that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.509
 puel secrets he has 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.589
 and it will also leave you 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 this link is to download it 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.249
 now let's see how it works 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.679
 let's open clear program 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:23.959
 that is this 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.839
 these the biography and thor 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 that we read click 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.229
 so that this programmatic veto can see 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:35.439
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.650
 a few rows along and across 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.370
 in 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.599
 for 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.630
 to write 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.079
 Maybe this is going to be on the sheet of his biography 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.459
 maybe a little preview of what they are going to write 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.699
 is going to be the method for 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.289
 to write 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.949
 you can put by the course you can write letters with the keyboard loyally 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.449
 and etc in the previous one can see how it is filling up but then we do not want it 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.809
 hearing that is not what we obviously want 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.009
 because it's going it's wiped 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.939
 the letters 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.299
 another way of writing 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.620
 select that square and choose one of these characters that come here 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.459
 down 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.960
 miscellany percent 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.739
 Also there 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.029
 edges can are these 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.349

 the pictures and so on 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.469
 numerical values 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.349
 are these 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.499
 and good will accept the option of seeing 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 in biographies that are made by other people 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:39.759
 artistic 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.039
 for what he's going to do, let's go to the xbox 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.729
 to check that everything is fine 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.729
 good minute 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.319
 by electoral action xbox is what they will do good will be to enter the film 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.449
 the profile that ranging from the scan 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.020
 Here is mine 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.020
 some are going to initiate session in the fox govern it t 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.779
 let's hope that between 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.389
 go for the other make passes check their profile 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.569
 but it failed profile 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.080
 and how can they see 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.180
 is already cast 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.400
 the 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.400
 but certify it as you can see 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.270
 well that's all discreet is a little imagination 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.400
 and these will have their artistic biography as they like 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.319
 but I remember that my video 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.919
 to move away suggestions for a hundred requests on the tutors that 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.210

 so what is offered to them 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.430
 it was the sixth then I refer for 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.199
