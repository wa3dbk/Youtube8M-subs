00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
this beef stew is made with ketchup I

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.540 
this beef stew is made with ketchup I
prefer<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.110> make<00:01:47.170> my<00:01:47.320> beef<00:01:47.680> stew<00:01:48.010> this<00:01:48.250> way

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
prefer to make my beef stew this way

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.600 
prefer to make my beef stew this way
rather<00:01:49.060> than<00:01:49.420> canning<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:50.050> all<00:01:50.260> together

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
rather than canning that all together

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.250 
rather than canning that all together
because<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:52.000> beef<00:01:52.210> has<00:01:52.660> such<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> long

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
because the beef has such a long

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.890 
because the beef has such a long
processing<00:01:54.070> time<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.119> vegetables<00:01:55.690> will

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
processing time that the vegetables will

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.719 
processing time that the vegetables will
be<00:01:55.930> very<00:01:56.260> mushy<00:01:56.619> if<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.160> can<00:01:57.369> them<00:01:57.580> all

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
be very mushy if you can them all

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.030 
be very mushy if you can them all
together<00:01:57.910> so<00:01:58.780> it's<00:01:58.960> very<00:01:59.170> easy<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.619> put<00:01:59.920> this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
together so it's very easy to put this

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.490 
together so it's very easy to put this
all<00:02:00.280> together<00:02:00.869> after<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.990> fact<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:05.020> you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
all together after the fact so there you

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.160 
all together after the fact so there you
go<00:02:05.710> another<00:02:06.460> meal<00:02:06.880> made<00:02:07.450> completely<00:02:07.990> from

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
go another meal made completely from

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.580 
go another meal made completely from
food<00:02:08.410> storage<00:02:08.800> enjoy
