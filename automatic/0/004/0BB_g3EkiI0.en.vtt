little bit of solo casting and that will

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.370 
little bit of solo casting and that will
that<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.049> fill<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.430> probably<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.049> some

that will fill up probably you know some
gaps<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:20.939> crappy

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
gaps and just because it's so crappy

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
gaps and just because it's so crappy
maybe<00:01:22.170> I'll<00:01:22.290> make<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.710> crappiness<00:01:23.100> with

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
maybe I'll make up for crappiness with

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.100 
maybe I'll make up for crappiness with
volume<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.060> maybe<00:01:24.240> I'll<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.780> make<00:01:24.960> as

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
volume so maybe I'll just like make as

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
volume so maybe I'll just like make as
many<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.590> possibly<00:01:25.830> come<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.610> and
