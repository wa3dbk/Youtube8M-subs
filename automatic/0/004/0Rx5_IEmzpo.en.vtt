the<00:00:20.090> girls<00:00:20.330> would<00:00:20.510> have<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.779> leave<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.020> babies

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
the girls would have to leave the babies

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.960 
the girls would have to leave the babies
with<00:00:21.500> us<00:00:21.650> yeah<00:00:22.039> why<00:00:22.250> don't<00:00:22.400> women<00:00:22.460> have<00:00:22.730> to<00:00:22.820> do

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
with us yeah why don't women have to do

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
with us yeah why don't women have to do
these<00:00:23.119> things<00:00:23.420> it's<00:00:23.869> very<00:00:23.960> simple

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
these things it's very simple

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.900 
these things it's very simple
when<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.340> scientific-minded<00:00:28.240> get<00:00:29.080> together

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
when the scientific-minded get together

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.440 
when the scientific-minded get together
to<00:00:30.910> invent<00:00:31.390> something<00:00:31.900> new<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.620> their<00:00:33.070> aim

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
to invent something new is their aim

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.500 
to invent something new is their aim
like<00:00:34.450> refrigerators<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.710> computation

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
like refrigerators and computation

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.790 
like refrigerators and computation
calculators<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.690> incubators<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.590> just

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
calculators and incubators and just

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300 
calculators and incubators and just
about<00:00:39.040> anything<00:00:39.370> else<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.210> can<00:00:40.450> name

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
about anything else that you can name

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.440 
about anything else that you can name
they<00:00:42.310> make<00:00:42.610> your<00:00:42.820> life<00:00:43.090> much<00:00:43.360> easier<00:00:43.420> no<00:00:44.350> doubt

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
they make your life much easier no doubt

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.090 
they make your life much easier no doubt
but<00:00:46.450> here's<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:47.020> way<00:00:47.230> I've<00:00:47.470> got<00:00:47.500> it<00:00:47.920> figured

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
but here's the way I've got it figured

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
but here's the way I've got it figured
out

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.130 

you<00:00:52.690> got<00:00:52.900> a<00:00:52.930> washer<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:54.520> wash<00:00:55.330> your<00:00:55.720> clothes

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
you got a washer to wash your clothes

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.549 
you got a washer to wash your clothes
you<00:00:56.530> turn<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.980> switch<00:00:57.100> on<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:58.269> off<00:00:59.110> she<00:00:59.530> goes

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
you turn the switch on and off she goes

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.610 
you turn the switch on and off she goes
so<00:01:00.460> they<00:01:00.730> figured<00:01:01.269> out<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.690> complicated

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
so they figured out the complicated

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.580 
so they figured out the complicated
dynamos<00:01:03.489> still<00:01:04.180> they've<00:01:04.480> never<00:01:04.690> figured<00:01:05.410> out

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
dynamos still they've never figured out

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.710 
dynamos still they've never figured out
a<00:01:05.920> woman<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.750> got<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> gadget<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:09.360> cook<00:01:10.360> your

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
a woman you got a gadget to cook your

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.760 
a woman you got a gadget to cook your
roast<00:01:11.050> you<00:01:11.500> got<00:01:11.710> another<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.810> pop<00:01:14.050> your<00:01:14.440> toes

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
roast you got another to pop your toes

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.980 
roast you got another to pop your toes
still<00:01:15.370> live<00:01:15.640> therefore<00:01:15.909> figured<00:01:16.600> out<00:01:16.750> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
still live therefore figured out the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.350 
still live therefore figured out the
thing<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.470> bothers<00:01:17.980> most<00:01:18.400> no<00:01:19.000> they've<00:01:19.330> never

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
thing that bothers most no they've never

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.590 
thing that bothers most no they've never
figured<00:01:20.260> out<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.770> woman<00:01:21.600> they're

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
figured out a woman they're

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.790 
figured out a woman they're
unpredictable<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.460> contradiction<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
unpredictable so contradiction like the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.330 
unpredictable so contradiction like the
weather<00:01:27.100> may<00:01:27.700> change<00:01:28.060> overnight<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:30.070> don't

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
weather may change overnight we don't

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.610 
weather may change overnight we don't
know<00:01:30.550> who<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:30.850> blame<00:01:31.060> but<00:01:31.930> things<00:01:32.260> have<00:01:32.500> been

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
know who to blame but things have been

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.620 
know who to blame but things have been
the<00:01:32.680> same<00:01:33.270> since<00:01:34.270> Eve<00:01:34.570> got<00:01:35.020> her<00:01:35.230> atom<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:36.160> bite

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the same since Eve got her atom to bite

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.370 
the same since Eve got her atom to bite
you've<00:01:37.630> got<00:01:37.870> a<00:01:37.900> heater

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
you've got a heater

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.679 
you've got a heater
to<00:01:40.009> heat<00:01:40.250> your<00:01:40.520> flat<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.409> regulated<00:01:42.409> a
