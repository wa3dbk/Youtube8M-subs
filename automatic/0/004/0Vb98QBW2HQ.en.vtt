00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.340
SKY'S HORSES THE SUCCESSION

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.600
And that's how Ulysse and Mustang saved us!

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.820
I looove this story!

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.900
Mee too! And I know it by heart!

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.975
My father is the best!

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540
Pfff...You're joking right?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.391
You're jealous!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.580
Mustang is a hero too!

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.660
You're joking ? He was a traitor.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.900
But he did a sacrifice for our clans!

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.140
What do you think Tabs?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.740
Tabs?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780
He is so cold...

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.220
It shouldn't be easy for him, he's an orphan!

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
That's why he should try to make friends.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.860
But we don't know anything about him!

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.633
We can try to be friends with him...

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.620
I'm going to ask my dad why Tabs never speaks with us.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.571
I come with you!

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.380
Dad! Dad!

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.260
What's going on?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.560
We have a question...

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.240
Why...

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780
Why does Tabs never speaks to us?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.520
Y'know Ideal, Tabs is an orphan.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.240
He just arrived

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.060
It's normal he doesn't dare to approach the others foals.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.880
Yeah but, it's weird!

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.608
I feel worry for him!

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480
Approach him slowly, let him come to you.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.809
Don't worry.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.720
What's more, we will always be there to look after you.

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:15.686
Right, thanks Dad!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.180
Don't go back too late. And don't push him!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.280
No problem!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.515
Hey Sun!

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.720
The new foal here, Tabs,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.140
Will he be in the Infinity herd?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.480
Yes,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.400
It seems to be the best by judging his origin.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.800
According to MystÃ¨re, Tabs would have mysterious powers.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.900
We will see!

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180
By now, he needs a good education.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.120
When I am chief of the Moon herd,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.880
we will be the best clan!

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.140
Eh, don't be so enthousiastic,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.600
We have to remain united.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.580
We will always be united Enron, don't worry!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.020
And before being a chief, see if you can catch me!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.860
Eh, wait for me!

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760
Woooah! Well...Hi Tabs!

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.141
How's going?

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:19.321
Well, Hi Enron... It doesn't matter.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.040
Ehh what have you done?

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.151
Ehm, nothing, I rushed over him

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.380
It wasn't my fault.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.980
He's really an antisocial...

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.820
Probably...

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.700
To be continued...
