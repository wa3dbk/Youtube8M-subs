00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 and the chain saws are tools 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880
 quite common in gardening but for 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 that work correctly we need 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.889
 have an optimal maintenance of your 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.770
 chain just lubricate with oil 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.930
 to do it but from time to time it's 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 you need to sharpen the chain now 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.000
 let's teach how to do it first 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 is to have clear some concepts the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 chain is placed over the guide and it 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 fit so that the link we're going 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.019
 sharpening is the one remaining high 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 Once adjusted, the rest as 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 let's move, it will adjust for a moment 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 it's a matter of trying but you'll see how 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 It is very simple although at the beginning 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530
 It costs a bit to catch on the trick 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.940
 remember to naturally block it for 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940
 that do not move 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.450
 block we see that fits 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.450
 perfectly so we already have it 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.980
 the blades have cutting direction 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.980
 and in the chain they alternate 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.880
 so first we'll look at the 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.560
 links and then the others depending 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.450
 of the direction of the blade the base 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.690
 we have to adjust normally about 30 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.690
 degrees 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.570
 As you can see, the disc fits perfectly 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.190
 with the knife and the friction will be what 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.350
 I took the edge 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.090
 you have to do it little by little 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.270
 so as not to destroy the disc or burn the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.159
 chain and lose all the sharpening 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.109
 and very important please to avoid 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.659
 scares remember to have the sharpener okay 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.890
 subject and turn on and off for each 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.070
 link especially if you are not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.070
 accustomed 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.210
 having all this in mind let's 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 Sharpen 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.680
 all right 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.290
 once the first link is sharpened 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.000
 we alternate one and continue to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.189
 next we check that it is already 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.189
 adjusted perfectly and we continue 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 pending 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.520
 I hope this little guide has 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.260
 Helped to extend life 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.599
 useful that shows it is worth remembering that a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.150
 planet port we have chain saws 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.430
 freezer lubricating oils 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.120
 if you are left to lose the doubt 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.129

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.670
