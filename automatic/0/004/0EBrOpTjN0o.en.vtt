00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.240 
dollars and so babe they basically paid
and<00:02:21.170> let's<00:02:21.500> describe<00:02:21.740> three<00:02:21.980> hundred

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
and let's describe three hundred

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.470 
and let's describe three hundred
thousand<00:02:22.550> dollars<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.910> quit<00:02:23.090> doing<00:02:23.360> what

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
thousand dollars to quit doing what

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.870 
thousand dollars to quit doing what
they're<00:02:23.630> doing<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:24.200> I'm<00:02:24.950> assuming<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.640> they

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
they're doing but I'm assuming that they

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.370 
they're doing but I'm assuming that they
wouldn't<00:02:26.240> care<00:02:26.480> they<00:02:26.750> would<00:02:26.900> take<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.200> money

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
wouldn't care they would take the money

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.480 
wouldn't care they would take the money
and<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:27.800> do<00:02:28.280> whatever<00:02:28.460> with<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.750> since

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
and just do whatever with it but since

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.310 
and just do whatever with it but since
whatever<00:02:31.490> anonymous<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.300> on<00:02:32.480> them<00:02:32.690> they<00:02:32.870> use

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
whatever anonymous is on them they use

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.610 
whatever anonymous is on them they use
this<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.340> kind<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.030> like<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> getaway<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.900> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
this as a kind of like a getaway as to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.110 
this as a kind of like a getaway as to
why<00:02:36.800> they're<00:02:37.010> gonna<00:02:37.160> stop<00:02:37.460> doing<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.760> makes

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
why they're gonna stop doing this makes
