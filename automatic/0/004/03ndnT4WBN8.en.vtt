to wait and see but to the locomotion as
i<00:00:31.529> said<00:00:31.590> before<00:00:32.239> that<00:00:33.239> technology<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.380> looks

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
i said before that technology it looks

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
i said before that technology it looks
pretty<00:00:35.190> good<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.300> don't<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:36.750> it's

will<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:50.090> defensive<00:00:51.090> tackle

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
will this have on defensive tackle

will this have on defensive tackle
animations<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.160> by<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.520> i<00:00:53.760> mean<00:00:53.910> this

in this game was in madden 10 here's the
iron<00:01:04.140> foot<00:01:04.379> animation<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.309> usually

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
iron foot animation this usually

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.870 
iron foot animation this usually
occurred<00:01:06.150> immediately<00:01:06.900> after<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.460> handoff

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
occurred immediately after the handoff

foot<00:01:13.890> weighs<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.760> tons<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.869> now

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
foot weighs two tons so here we go now

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.910 
foot weighs two tons so here we go now

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
directly to my left I'm trying to bait

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
directly to my left I'm trying to bait
this<00:01:28.619> defender<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.390> spend<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this defender so I can spend to the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
this defender so I can spend to the
sideline<00:01:31.970> up<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> end<00:01:33.810> zone<00:01:33.869> however<00:01:35.119> once

sideline up to the end zone however once

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
sideline up to the end zone however once
i<00:01:36.270> execute<00:01:36.810> my<00:01:36.930> spin<00:01:37.200> move<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.640> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
i execute my spin move right here it is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
i execute my spin move right here it is
immediately<00:01:39.119> disabled<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.590> what

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
immediately disabled because of what

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.850 
immediately disabled because of what
number<00:01:41.100> 60<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.180> doing<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> exactly

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
number 60 is doing and this is exactly

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.639 
number 60 is doing and this is exactly
what<00:01:44.369> i<00:01:44.399> mean<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:45.240> we're<00:01:45.540> able<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.990> lean<00:01:46.290> our

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
what i mean if we're able to lean our

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.609 
what i mean if we're able to lean our
players<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> left<00:01:48.619> you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
players to the right and to the left you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.010 
players to the right and to the left you
know<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.920> an<00:01:50.070> evasive<00:01:50.369> move<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.750> evasive

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
know as an evasive move and an evasive

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.370 
know as an evasive move and an evasive
tactic<00:01:53.270> will<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.420> ultimately<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:55.259> get

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
tactic will we ultimately just get

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
tactic will we ultimately just get
sucked<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.799> tackles<00:01:56.340> anyway<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.509> what

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
sucked into tackles anyway you know what

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
sucked into tackles anyway you know what
effect<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.799> how<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.729> get

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
effect will that have on how we get

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.889 
effect will that have on how we get
tackled<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:01.229> spin<00:02:01.560> move<00:02:01.799> I'm

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
tackled as you can see my spin move I'm

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.600 
tackled as you can see my spin move I'm
supposed<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.280> headed<00:02:05.280> towards<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
supposed to be headed towards the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.749 
supposed to be headed towards the
sideline<00:02:06.259> but<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.740> computer<00:02:08.160> won't<00:02:08.280> allow<00:02:08.550> me

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
sideline but the computer won't allow me

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.290 
sideline but the computer won't allow me
to<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:10.080> spin<00:02:10.349> move<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:11.090> being<00:02:12.090> used

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
to do it so the spin move on being used

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550 
to do it so the spin move on being used
as<00:02:12.450> an<00:02:12.599> evasive<00:02:12.810> move

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
as an evasive move

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100 
as an evasive move
