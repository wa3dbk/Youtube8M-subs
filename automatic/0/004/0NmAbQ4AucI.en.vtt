something<00:00:25.350> that's<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:25.890> better<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> i

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
something that's a lot better and i

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.670 
something that's a lot better and i
think<00:00:26.519> asus<00:00:27.210> did<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.470> all

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
two USB port and one of them actually is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.270 
two USB port and one of them actually is
you<00:01:56.130> speed<00:01:56.430> through<00:01:56.640> point<00:01:57.180> O<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.990> 11<00:01:58.619> port

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you speed through point O that's 11 port

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510 
you speed through point O that's 11 port
and<00:01:59.490> for<00:02:00.000> land<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.530> them<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.950> gigabit

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and for land for all of them are gigabit

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.639 
and for land for all of them are gigabit
didn't<00:02:03.090> say<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.420> word<00:02:03.450> port<00:02:03.869> well<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
didn't say one word port well actually I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.889 
didn't say one word port well actually I
aligned<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.820> also<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> first<00:02:06.299> I've<00:02:06.780> seen

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
aligned this is also the first I've seen

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.080 
aligned this is also the first I've seen
that<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.829> turn<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:08.729> land

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that actually can turn one of these land

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.740 
that actually can turn one of these land
port<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.020> secondary<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.400> port<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.940> that

port into a secondary one port and that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.670 
port into a secondary one port and that
means<00:02:12.959> we're<00:02:13.290> here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
means we're here

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
much does it cost well two hundred and

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.300 
much does it cost well two hundred and
twenty<00:03:15.629> dollars<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.560> find<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.889> expensive

twenty dollars if you find it expensive

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.729 
twenty dollars if you find it expensive
