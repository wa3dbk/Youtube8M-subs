00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello everyone with you i enter it he 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:10.559
 found in general atech kac 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.230
 you know it is very stormy that I have the right 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 which changes you can change colors 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.869
 icons when entering armor in total seconds 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.509
 which although in the sump in general everything 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.489
 copyright exactly matthew barns 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.849
 nothing 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:33.510
 purely mine for me in general, all for 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.930
 we than burnus he sat and here each 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 replace it there after all sat there 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.050
 just need to press multitude let's say 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 icons and relate armor for example 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.150
 choose for something like that and it is necessary 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 put asleep room's this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.450
 colors are not only slightly smaller 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:01.110
 so let's say for example we are worth 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.120
 for example let's put red yes here 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.520
 and constantly an example dark red is like 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.830
 earlier and now you can put for example 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.200
 some sort of something like that and 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.560
 to put to put constant example 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.370
 some kind of such thing 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.500
 then armor doesnâ€™t seem so 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.960
 so the button is the button text from we will have 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.180
 highlight a button 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.950
 Well, let's give for example orange 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.460
 cursor means when we hover over 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.000
 We will come well, so let's say some 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.960
 icon what we started to do something with it 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.840
 Here we change for example to such 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:53.650
 little green like all the rules so click 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.870
 click here is still very cool 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.750
 for example on blue yes everything is good on blue 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.320
 now we have a twist school bar 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.800
 button that moves objects 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.750
 some list or something here is our manni and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.680
 look here there are many colors you can 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.330
 change everything we need and also here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.459
 to business 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.190
 dialogue is a cool thing in general when 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.110
 we for example will write mmm and statistics 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.480
 your character then we appear 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.440
 atomic statistics of characters and we have her 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.040
 we can change the color like this 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.860
 for example, then for example 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.440
 I don't know for sure let's do it already 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.770
 Immediately put it among the head here 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.160
 Immediately all the way we go further vodka tabs 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.730
 Tufa is our server has no names Karpenko 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.409

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.069
 miran will be with us on blue our server 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:03:01.840
 then we will have all the little red type 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:06.640
 all beautiful hands and player give up too 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 We put a blue sign to a lot of tones 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.370
 there are a lot of flowers there was this all this 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.400
 not very fun like this and here 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.140
 let's change the text 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.269
 somehow change it for example let's 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.840
 white put because it's somehow not 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.579
 highly 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.340

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:34.900
 no no such posted on 20 put 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.609
 for example then we go here there are a couple more 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.310
 buns 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.849
 for example, you can change it is in itself 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.599
 replica startup saw here is shorter so 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.359
 what let's change for example is and but 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.840
 and 3z put some green water 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.319
 dohrena finally just answer well and here 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.900
 let's get this blue after 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.519
 debt sinha yet 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.620
 screenshot can be put on red 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.120
 because how you are highlighted 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.090
 made a screenshot for nehuy and all things 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.790
 so this does not mean that but it seems to be 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.040
 seems to give nothing further 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.840
 click brass to save it all and 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.840
 click bratz then we go to the sun folder 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.790

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.430
