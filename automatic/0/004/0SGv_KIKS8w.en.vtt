00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 in 1991 the decade of the 90 was released 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.750
 and we are one step away from the promising and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.880
 futuristic year 2000 we believed so 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 modern that we thought we had to 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
 renew our whole step and that's how 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.109
 Mr. Steven Spielberg gave him a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.480
 modern and good touch as modern as 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 it can be to change the color to 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 old looney tunes and so I create value there 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.230
 nor did you the pseudo tv had a great 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 acceptance in the ninth-graders as well 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 that konami hurried to buy the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.320
 rights of the show to launch a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.390
 video game for the powerful in jazz the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.420
 plot of this game is somewhat complex and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 surreal the evil max montana has 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.910
 kidnapped to brahms ivonne and why 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.520
 Well because it is the bad and point cause 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.129
 so booster gathers three of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 his best friends the duck block and vice 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 and pull back 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
 full back we knew him as 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 Pelusso or at least that's what our 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.720
 thermal glasses that changed color on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.590
 game is divided into six levels of giles 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.530
 the trees downtown guakil and and by 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.720
 last the mansion of max montana as already 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 we had said monster bonny will go 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.580
 accompanied by only one of his friends 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 selected but be careful and choose 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.920
 well since they have different skills 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.960
 each mission is easier, for example 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.200
 what has the ability to fall with 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.150
 style and swim with great skill and if you 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.970
 transforms into a whirlpool for about 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.870
 seconds that annihilates all your steps and 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.330
 football said pelusso can climb walls 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.460
 each level has a boss or an enemy or 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.150
 a monster as you want to say in each 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.810
 mission as a skateboarding scientist 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.750
 classic or an old pirate or a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 and that thing a gorilla in a building in 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.930
 construction until you reach max montana 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.020
 there is also a secret enemy the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.090
 mighty of vader to take it out should you 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.459
 defeat a mission enemy with a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.310
 number of carrots with multiples of 11 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.069
 and if you defeat him, he will reward you with 3 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.230
 lives this game has good graphics 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.510
 without being surprising but that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.120
 yes investment legacy is really 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.160
 elevated good although it has often been 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.530
 crossed out to be one of the many clones 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.260
 of super mario bros 3 but before that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.959
 you go is by reviews or by people 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.300
 embittered like me I recommend that you 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.940
