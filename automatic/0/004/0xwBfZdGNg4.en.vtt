of<00:00:27.240> go<00:00:27.420> towards<00:00:27.930> obviously<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> dirt<00:00:29.130> again

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of go towards obviously the dirt again

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.150 
of go towards obviously the dirt again
but<00:00:30.029> I'm<00:00:30.210> looking<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.779> either<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.590> scalar<00:00:32.250> or<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
but I'm looking at either a scalar or a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.180 
but I'm looking at either a scalar or a
crawler<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:37.260> know<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.800> look<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.100> all

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
crawler and you know if you look at all

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
crawler and you know if you look at all
of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.579> different<00:00:40.280> companies<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.660> I'm

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
of the different companies out there I'm

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
of the different companies out there I'm
really<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> drawn<00:00:43.500> towards<00:00:43.860> axial<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
really kind of drawn towards axial I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.110 
really kind of drawn towards axial I
know<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.510> bought<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.050> by<00:00:46.260> I

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
know that they just got bought out by I

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
know that they just got bought out by I
guess<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> different<00:00:48.629> company<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.200> so

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
guess a different company out there so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
guess a different company out there so
there's<00:00:49.770> some<00:00:49.980> issues<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.809> supply<00:00:52.399> but<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
there's some issues with supply but I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.689 
there's some issues with supply but I
pretty<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.510> drawn<00:00:55.050> between<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.800> different

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
pretty much drawn between two different

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.540 
pretty much drawn between two different
designs<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.460> obviously

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
designs right now one you know obviously

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.470 
designs right now one you know obviously
is<00:01:00.030> probably<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> most<00:01:00.660> popular<00:01:02.270> axial<00:01:03.270> car

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
is probably the most popular axial car

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
is probably the most popular axial car
out<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.769> axial<00:01:05.220> wraith

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
out there and that is the axial wraith

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
out there and that is the axial wraith
the<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.159> draws<00:01:08.939> my

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the other one that really draws my

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.230 
the other one that really draws my
attention<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.010> from<00:01:11.880> reading<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
attention and you know from reading a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
attention and you know from reading a
lot<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> forums<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> lot<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
lot of the forums and a lot of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.480 
lot of the forums and a lot of the
different<00:01:14.820> YouTube<00:01:15.659> videos<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.490> watching

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
different YouTube videos or watching

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.039 
different YouTube videos or watching
them<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> guess<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.369> scx10<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
them I guess is the scx10 and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
them I guess is the scx10 and
particularly<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> honcho<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.880> going

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
particularly the honcho and I'm going

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.289 
particularly the honcho and I'm going
pretty<00:01:24.780> much<00:01:24.990> between<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:26.400> RT<00:01:26.729> ours<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.119> both

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
pretty much between the RT ours of both

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
pretty much between the RT ours of both
of<00:01:27.330> those<00:01:27.540> versions<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:30.299> I've<00:01:30.659> read<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> bad

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
of those versions and I've read the bad

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.319 
of those versions and I've read the bad
and<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.040> good<00:01:32.130> about<00:01:32.430> both<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.180> know

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and the good about both you know

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.920 
and the good about both you know
obviously<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.619> Wraith<00:01:34.950> has<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:36.180> issues

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
obviously the the Wraith has some issues

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.870 
obviously the the Wraith has some issues
with<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.860> high<00:01:38.100> center<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.460> gravity<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:40.880> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
with a high center of gravity and you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.219 
with a high center of gravity and you
know<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> multitude<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> issues

know that it has a multitude of issues
with<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> suspension<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.020> as<00:01:46.020> far<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
with the suspension and the as far as

the steering linkage and a few other

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.069 
the steering linkage and a few other
things<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.630> making

things so you know I'm all about making

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.690 
things so you know I'm all about making
things<00:01:52.320> better<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.520> could

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
things better and I think I could

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.870 
things better and I think I could
definitely<00:01:53.820> help<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.360> vehicle<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.880> here's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
definitely help that vehicle but here's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
definitely help that vehicle but here's
the<00:01:56.939> biggest<00:01:57.360> issue<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.290> scx10

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the biggest issue I have is the scx10

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
the biggest issue I have is the scx10
honcho<00:01:59.340> is<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> stock<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.170> can't<00:02:01.409> find

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
honcho is that a stock and I can't find

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
honcho is that a stock and I can't find
it<00:02:01.770> anywhere<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.219> Southern<00:02:02.520> California<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
also online I'm not too particular about

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
also online I'm not too particular about
ordering<00:02:07.049> things<00:02:07.229> online<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> hate

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
ordering things online because I hate

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.390 
ordering things online because I hate
waiting<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:09.470> every<00:02:10.470> shop<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
waiting but every shop out there is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.059 
waiting but every shop out there is
pretty<00:02:11.849> much<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.140> honcho

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
pretty much out of the the honcho

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.580 
pretty much out of the the honcho

to put the wrong motor and you know I'm
pretty<00:02:52.049> good<00:02:52.169> with<00:02:52.230> servos<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.919> you<00:02:53.189> know<00:02:53.280> I'm

pretty<00:02:53.579> much<00:02:53.730> overkill<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.329> servo<00:02:54.719> but<00:02:54.989> you

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:55.949 
pretty much overkill the servo but you

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:57.500 
pretty much overkill the servo but you
know<00:02:56.040> then<00:02:56.219> there's<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.459> little<00:02:56.699> dig<00:02:57.120> thing

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
and just not too sure about how to get

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.800 
and just not too sure about how to get
that<00:03:00.419> thing<00:03:00.480> up<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.900> running<00:03:01.280> correctly<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
that thing up and running correctly and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.729

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:07.199 
hundred dollars on a motor and ESC and

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.869 
hundred dollars on a motor and ESC and
then<00:03:07.439> have<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.680> buy<00:03:07.769> something<00:03:08.010> different<00:03:08.639> and

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
people say you have to run brushless in

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.270 
people say you have to run brushless in
it<00:03:11.340> because<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.319> worm<00:03:13.319> drive<00:03:13.769> whatever

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
the two on both the Wraith RTR and the

think I'm pretty much drawn towards the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.460 
think I'm pretty much drawn towards the
scx<00:03:27.389> if<00:03:27.689> it<00:03:28.409> was<00:03:28.590> available<00:03:28.889> but<00:03:30.409> other<00:03:31.409> than

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
scx if it was available but other than

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.999 
scx if it was available but other than
that<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:32.129> is<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:32.639> on<00:03:33.709> also<00:03:34.709> if<00:03:34.889> you
