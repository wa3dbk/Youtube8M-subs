are<00:00:39.629> especially<00:00:39.870> looking<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.379> buy<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
are especially looking a buy one is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
are especially looking a buy one is
there's<00:00:42.059> basically<00:00:42.690> three<00:00:42.809> elements

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there's basically three elements

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.729 
there's basically three elements
distance<00:00:44.480> how<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> jumps<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.079> distance<00:00:46.559> both

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
distance how it jumps with distance both

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.420 
distance how it jumps with distance both
close<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.129> far<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.469> how<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> jumps<00:00:49.950> using

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
close and far and how it jumps using

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.869 
close and far and how it jumps using
both<00:00:50.930> grips<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.199> standard<00:00:52.710> American<00:00:53.460> grip<00:00:53.670> or

ball spacing which to me is your

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
ball spacing which to me is your
standard<00:01:10.140> distance<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> majority<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> the

and it's the same thing with keeping the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.500 
and it's the same thing with keeping the
extension<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> cue<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.800> allows<00:02:23.510> for

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
extension on the cue it allows for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.350 
extension on the cue it allows for
stability<00:02:25.200> when<00:02:25.440> using<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.580> American<00:02:27.090> grip

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
stability when using the American grip

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.280 
stability when using the American grip
which<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.780> what<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.200> ideal<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:30.290> it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
which is what it's ideal for and it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
which is what it's ideal for and it
allows<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.010> clean<00:02:32.310> jump<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.769> comfort<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
allows for a clean jump and comfort the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.610 
allows for a clean jump and comfort the
third<00:02:36.830> shot<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> use<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.580> test<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
third shot that I use to test is the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.060 
third shot that I use to test is the
closed<00:02:40.920> jump<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.940> use<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.860> European<00:02:43.860> grip

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
closed jump and I use the European grip

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.759 
closed jump and I use the European grip
the<00:02:44.280> dart<00:02:44.489> grip<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> predator<00:02:46.560> air

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
the dart grip and with the predator air

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.670 
the dart grip and with the predator air
tool<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.340> makes<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:48.600> shot<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.170> easier

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
tool it makes this shot a lot easier

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.220 
tool it makes this shot a lot easier
because<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.370> unscrew<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
because I can unscrew the back the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.670 
because I can unscrew the back the
extension<00:02:53.150> making<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.330> for<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.959> much<00:02:55.320> lighter

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
extension making it for a much lighter

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.530 
extension making it for a much lighter
jump<00:02:56.160> cue<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.640> still<00:02:57.049> tournament<00:02:58.049> legal<00:02:58.350> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
jump cue and still tournament legal and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.860 
jump cue and still tournament legal and
the<00:03:00.540> process<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.380> same<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:03.000> I'm<00:03:03.239> using<00:03:03.480> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the process is the same but I'm using a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.640 
the process is the same but I'm using a
dark<00:03:04.410> grip<00:03:04.730> with<00:03:05.730> an<00:03:05.850> open<00:03:06.090> hand<00:03:06.239> bridge<00:03:06.560> I'm<00:03:07.560> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
dark grip with an open hand bridge I'm a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.740 
dark grip with an open hand bridge I'm a
named<00:03:07.799> course<00:03:08.160> enter<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.360> little

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
named course enter that with a little

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:20.990 
named course enter that with a little
bit<00:03:09.870> more<00:03:10.049> elevation<00:03:10.610> not<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> whole<00:03:11.940> lot<00:03:20.000> what

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
bit more elevation not a whole lot what

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.819 
bit more elevation not a whole lot what
I<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.239> about<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.660> predator<00:03:22.049> air<00:03:22.230> too<00:03:22.500> is

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
I like about the predator air too is

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.690 
I like about the predator air too is
that<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.430> allows<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:24.120> closed<00:03:24.390> jump<00:03:24.780> shots<00:03:25.700> to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
that it allows on closed jump shots to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.240 
that it allows on closed jump shots to
break<00:03:27.360> down<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.840> cue<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.170> modify<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.769> by

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
break down the cue and modify it by

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.240 
break down the cue and modify it by
reducing<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.060> weight<00:03:30.530> allows<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> quick

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
reducing the weight allows for a quick

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.210 
reducing the weight allows for a quick
jab<00:03:33.380> which<00:03:34.380> is

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
jab which is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.680 
jab which is
more<00:03:35.730> ideal<00:03:36.180> for<00:03:36.510> clothes<00:03:36.930> jumpshots<00:03:38.690> thanks
