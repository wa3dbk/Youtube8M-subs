00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.340
 hello guys welcome this new one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 episode of the clash of land was enough 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.880
 some time but here we are second that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 here they invaded me ok then i brought 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.460
 most things at most 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 and fair it also imports the video to the veil 5 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 verse because it is because I brought everything to 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.270
 maximum level so I had to bring the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 wine then in front of substance I have not yet 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.629
 got nothing because i didn't make attacks 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 since it was the week there is 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.239
 the league was divided into two 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.890
 flight weeks it was written 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 someone but takata when i hear for 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.520
 a hundred worried about some of them but all of them 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.829
 saw I want to tell you that I did 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.870
 various attacks and I give a thing 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.289
 this does not show me but edits with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 25 barbarians and 25 archers I took this 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.379
 a lot of stuff is a huge thing 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 she is beautiful but we did it 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.479
 I did a lot of stuff 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.590
 now i'm trying to improve mine 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.710
 change to the maximum level because 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.770
 I want others all now as troops or 40 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 talk about how many five giant archers e 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 2 splits smashes walls this because they have 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 I saw a couple of videos we see 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.409
 what is the best choice in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 how much more or less the damage is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.299
 very useful now i have changed my villa 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.680
 this because because I still had to 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.420
 we are at various things therefore for the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.820
 moment I put it a little bit but hardly 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.250
 possible i would like to get me what the tower 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 of the magician soon in goal however now not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.960
 I have enough builders and if possible 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 get me another 30 jamison 40 gianni ones 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.829
 which is why the talent is made 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.070
 another 40 days maybe we also have the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.060
 cash no we do how many people we can 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.100
 have an extra builder and be 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.360
 more or less happy now positive to get me 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.820
 also a spell factory 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.909
 finally they cost a lot however to the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.430
 facts if I had what we can do and for 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.840
 make stupid level 5 on two days two 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.880
 days so I ask you when you want 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.429
 said is ulisse from now on with android 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.979
 ahead to make a casino of Rome 15 to put 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.000
 a mess of time then apart from 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.650
 bullshit 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.540
 we are going to attack a beautiful 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.400
 new friend if they are to find him one 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.710
 powerful one that to many pennies and that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.760
 can then give me back the cost 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.560
 this is because of my crew 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.650
 important to be able to get back at least the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.690
 double the cost of their troops 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.709
 however, it will be difficult to find it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.630
 so we 're just there 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.570
 thackeray is this here or ours 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.310
 dear friend who actually has nothing is 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.860
 very divided to break down then 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.920
 giant mandarins here give me problems 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
 perfect I have been stealing a couple of for a long time 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.320
 putting framework things in which a 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.150
 giant here 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.980
 ok thing though life as it had done in 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.680
 well I end up here but by a couple of 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.739
 whitebeard taccari these places 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.230
 perfect and brown kamura shoe which not 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.880
 I can manage to go in ok 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.530
 meanwhile same thing this part one 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.959
 here one here 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.940
 we steal various resources from this side 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.040
 ok if you have a fair amount of money 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.850
 I look for these and perfect barbarians 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.590
 go go go very easy I would say send a 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.220
 another piece of here and here they go instead 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 a perfect split then ok perfect 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.310
 go to the barbarians 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.110
 ok now the barbarians will pass and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.840
 they will go to destroy everything for the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.030
 cellars voices with deaf barbarian 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.459
 the Tuscan had given me an opposite 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.930
 I'm wrong it was very easy I have 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.940
 taken of a star sincerely is 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.140
 now I also do two without problems 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.780
 escaping is the village center was era 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.340
 however, 13 cups are bad enough 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.150
 I don't even know that much, but you put it 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.010
 120,000 pieces of gold are enough 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.290
 derivatives for what I did then 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.830
 okay since bamba of everything 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.360
 we received the right last 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.630
 received three hundred percent perfect stars 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.150
 a very easy hundred was not that much 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.829
 but it wasn't bad for the good green 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.069
 neither said nor less than I did phones 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.900
 level 4 is a lot says why anyway 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.329
 they cost a lot but got to the point 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.739
 where I had lots of gold and more 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.989
 what to do with it as it was to return to 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:20.959
 lunch 1 I have to go to 103 I have to 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.150
 pass to pass all three though I have to 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.530
 get me a few troops then for the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.470
 moment we also try to do another 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.300
 what we are going to do in this 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.070
 so i get 40 of these ok 40's 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.590
 another 40 of the other two faces because 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.419
 He pulled or 115 have their own fast 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:45.410
 I can do it inter and I do 30's 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:48.979
 these maybe 30 I told you ok no 35 ok 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.750
 and 40 instead of archers only 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.889
 maximum barracks because 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.560
 accident which can lead when 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.180
 we want is not a problem if the 56 is 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.130
 this when instead this where 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.770
 even take it to 7 to take i 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.810
 first magicians who would also be useful and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.610
 fantastic he had boys from Giuliano 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.340
 pitardi as soon as we have the troops already 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.979
 forehead therefore between more or less twenty 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.599
 minutes maybe even less than later 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.340
 so guys what do we have to do now 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.349
 it is sufficient to increase and improve 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.419
 and I also noted in attack 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.150
 pretty sharp i show why 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.610
 type must be recorded that it was bad 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.039
 sincerely attack sea indeed 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.020
 started placing troops here I have 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.720
 took a bunch of blows to the gods 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.360
 codes 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.270
 the ugan recovery of ugly but here they are 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.190
 stuck an then with our little golems 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.610
 and there are many goblins but the mind is 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.800
 heaven so that to kill and I do you 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.480
 see that it goes from this point I was going to 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.870
 losing the game feel done 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.970
 I miss a lot of points that happens to me 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.650
 I realize that he acquires love 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.150

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.110
 how many without problems 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:58.230
 I realize that fortunately there are here 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.780
 above some small barbarians are i 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.760
 boulders that can make me do 51 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.190
 percent and rias so quietly a 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.620
 winning at least nine cups roll was 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.060
 much of an attack but hey he could 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.130
 go even worse 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.390
