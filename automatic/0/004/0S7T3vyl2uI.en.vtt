yeah<00:03:08.379> this<00:03:08.620> guy<00:03:08.829> actually<00:03:09.069> he<00:03:09.609> has<00:03:09.730> an<00:03:09.909> IR

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
yeah this guy actually he has an IR

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.689 
yeah this guy actually he has an IR
sensor<00:03:10.750> much<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.230> Reptar<00:03:11.889> does<00:03:12.129> that

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
sensor much like Reptar does that

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.179 
sensor much like Reptar does that
actually<00:03:13.139> enables<00:03:14.139> him<00:03:14.439> to<00:03:14.470> be<00:03:14.680> controlled

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
actually enables him to be controlled

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.789 
actually enables him to be controlled
with<00:03:15.519> this<00:03:15.759> IR<00:03:16.150> beacon<00:03:16.569> so<00:03:17.109> I<00:03:17.139> can<00:03:17.530> remote

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
with this IR beacon so I can remote

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.800 
with this IR beacon so I can remote
control<00:03:18.220> him<00:03:18.430> among<00:03:18.699> other<00:03:18.879> things<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.419> we

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
control him among other things and we

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.749 
control him among other things and we
made<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:19.989> simple<00:03:20.199> program<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:20.829> when<00:03:20.949> you<00:03:21.009> push

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:21.759 
made a simple program so when you push

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.179 
made a simple program so when you push
the<00:03:21.939> touch<00:03:22.120> sensor<00:03:22.540> he's<00:03:23.019> gonna<00:03:23.169> shoot<00:03:23.439> so

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
the touch sensor he's gonna shoot so

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.999 
the touch sensor he's gonna shoot so
watch<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:24.609> over<00:03:24.849> there<00:03:25.030> that's<00:03:25.329> how<00:03:25.449> cheeky

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.009 
watch out over there that's how cheeky

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.159 
watch out over there that's how cheeky
and<00:03:27.009> from<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.430> one<00:03:27.639> set<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:27.909> can<00:03:28.269> build<00:03:28.509> five

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
and from that one set you can build five

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.619 
and from that one set you can build five
main<00:03:29.680> robots<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.669> then<00:03:30.909> add<00:03:31.060> an<00:03:31.239> additional

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
main robots and then add an additional

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.659 
main robots and then add an additional
12<00:03:31.900> robots<00:03:32.109> so<00:03:32.409> 17<00:03:32.889> different<00:03:33.099> robots<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.639> can

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
12 robots so 17 different robots you can

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.490 
12 robots so 17 different robots you can
build<00:03:33.909> with<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.329> one<00:03:34.389> kit<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:34.989> coming

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500
