the<00:03:06.709> schools<00:03:07.010> class<00:03:07.310> also<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.420> incredibly

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the schools class also have a incredibly

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
good turn speed is even now see and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.729 
good turn speed is even now see and
that's<00:03:12.920> great<00:03:13.459> for<00:03:14.110> express<00:03:15.110> train<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.590> course

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
that's great for express train of course

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.570 
that's great for express train of course

they wouldn't learn this fast with

either but as with any tender engine
it's<00:03:45.140> probably<00:03:45.470> best<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.769> keep<00:03:45.920> reversing<00:03:46.519> to

so<00:04:03.670> with<00:04:04.660> fantastic<00:04:05.080> detail<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:06.070> incredible

so with fantastic detail and incredible

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.760 
so with fantastic detail and incredible
performance<00:04:07.510> from<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.720> school's<00:04:08.020> class<00:04:08.350> it

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
performance from the school's class it

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.710 
performance from the school's class it
would<00:04:09.040> seem<00:04:09.310> like<00:04:09.520> these<00:04:09.700> engines<00:04:10.150> are<00:04:10.420> really

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
would seem like these engines are really

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.710 
would seem like these engines are really
fantastic<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.770> they<00:04:12.010> are<00:04:12.270> they're<00:04:13.270> really

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
fantastic and they are they're really

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.830 
fantastic and they are they're really
really<00:04:13.990> good<00:04:14.260> engines<00:04:14.710> and<00:04:15.450> but<00:04:16.450> their<00:04:16.570> price

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
really good engines and but their price

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.900 
really good engines and but their price
does<00:04:17.110> reflect<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.770> but<00:04:18.520> there<00:04:18.730> are<00:04:18.760> a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
does reflect that but there are a

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.460 
does reflect that but there are a
variety<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.570> places<00:04:19.840> where<00:04:20.170> you<00:04:20.200> could<00:04:20.320> get

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
variety of places where you could get

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.500 
variety of places where you could get
them<00:04:20.620> for<00:04:20.800> lower<00:04:20.950> prices<00:04:21.550> but<00:04:21.760> do<00:04:22.450> you

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
them for lower prices but do you

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.270 
them for lower prices but do you
remember<00:04:22.600> these<00:04:23.020> really<00:04:23.440> high<00:04:23.620> value<00:04:23.890> for

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
remember these really high value for

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.160 
remember these really high value for
money<00:04:24.430> engines<00:04:24.940> if<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.630> want<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.960> buy<00:04:26.110> an

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
money engines if you want to buy an

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.010 
money engines if you want to buy an
expensive<00:04:26.800> engine<00:04:27.490> for<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:27.970> reason<00:04:28.480> because

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
expensive engine for a reason because

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.990 
expensive engine for a reason because
it's<00:04:29.410> detailed<00:04:29.920> to<00:04:30.070> has<00:04:30.160> great<00:04:30.400> performance

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
it's detailed to has great performance

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.150 
it's detailed to has great performance
and<00:04:31.180> looks<00:04:31.420> great<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:32.500> has<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.890> be<00:04:33.010> the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
and looks great it has to be the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.820 
and looks great it has to be the
strongest<00:04:33.550> class<00:04:33.820> really<00:04:34.150> they<00:04:35.020> are<00:04:35.230> really

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
strongest class really they are really

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.580 
strongest class really they are really
really<00:04:36.310> good<00:04:36.520> engines<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.330> will<00:04:38.110> last<00:04:38.290> you

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
really good engines and will last you

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.700 
really good engines and will last you
many<00:04:38.740> years<00:04:39.060> due<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.210> their<00:04:40.390> five<00:04:40.810> Polsky<00:04:41.530> wire

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
many years due to their five Polsky wire

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.900 
many years due to their five Polsky wire
motor<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:43.240> are<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:44.020> good<00:04:44.380> investment<00:04:44.530> for<00:04:45.040> any

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
motor so are a good investment for any

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.910 
motor so are a good investment for any
layout<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.630> mean<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.260> could<00:04:47.410> rip<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.740> could

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
layout I mean you could rip this could

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.940 
layout I mean you could rip this could
represent<00:04:48.070> one<00:04:48.460> in<00:04:48.580> preservation<00:04:49.020> or<00:04:50.020> more

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
represent one in preservation or more

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.620 
represent one in preservation or more
even<00:04:51.130> on<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.400> southern<00:04:51.730> region<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.480> it's

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
even on the southern region and it's

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.860 
even on the southern region and it's
heydays<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.440> 1930s<00:04:54.250> as<00:04:54.970> express<00:04:55.450> engines

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
heydays in the 1930s as express engines

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.830 
heydays in the 1930s as express engines
so<00:04:56.500> on<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.550> whole<00:04:57.730> what<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> school's<00:04:58.540> class

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
so on the whole what is a school's class

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.560 
so on the whole what is a school's class
well<00:04:59.830> it's<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.370> fantastically<00:05:01.030> detailed

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
well it's a fantastically detailed

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.140 
well it's a fantastically detailed
engine<00:05:01.990> with<00:05:02.290> great<00:05:02.530> performance<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.910> will

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
engine with great performance that will

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.080 
engine with great performance that will
be<00:05:04.330> brilliant<00:05:04.690> on<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.110> mainline<00:05:05.650> layout<00:05:06.090> but

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
be brilliant on a mainline layout but

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.630 
be brilliant on a mainline layout but
will<00:05:07.720> perform<00:05:08.290> moderately<00:05:08.890> in<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.220> shunting

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
will perform moderately in a shunting

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.660 
will perform moderately in a shunting
role<00:05:10.080> I'd<00:05:11.080> strongly<00:05:11.500> recommend<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.190> engine

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
role I'd strongly recommend this engine

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.440 
role I'd strongly recommend this engine
to<00:05:13.030> people<00:05:13.660> with<00:05:13.780> mainline<00:05:14.260> layouts<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.460> it's

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
to people with mainline layouts and it's

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.170 
to people with mainline layouts and it's
real<00:05:16.690> joy<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.230> have<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.770> has<00:05:18.640> very<00:05:18.940> few
