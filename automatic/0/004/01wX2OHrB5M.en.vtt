box so we've got some productivity
applications<00:02:01.790> we've<00:02:02.790> also<00:02:02.910> got<00:02:03.180> some

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
applications we've also got some

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.880 
applications we've also got some
enterprise<00:02:03.660> applications<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.560> these<00:02:04.740> ones

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
enterprise applications like these ones

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.030 
enterprise applications like these ones
from<00:02:05.100> sa<00:02:05.430> p<00:02:06.230> I'll<00:02:07.230> quickly<00:02:07.410> show<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
from sa p I'll quickly show you one of

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.609 
from sa p I'll quickly show you one of
those<00:02:08.130> because<00:02:08.400> that's<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.790> interesting

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
those because that's really interesting

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.770 
those because that's really interesting
so<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.010> just<00:02:11.280> designed<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.600> help

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
so this is just designed to help

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.840 
so this is just designed to help
demonstrate<00:02:13.620> what's<00:02:14.040> possible<00:02:14.580> with

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
demonstrate what's possible with

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.000 
demonstrate what's possible with
integration<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.810> SI<00:02:16.110> p<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.800> app

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
integration of SI p so in this app

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.010 
integration of SI p so in this app
you've<00:02:17.640> got<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.150> know<00:02:18.180> your<00:02:18.390> store<00:02:18.660> layout

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
you've got you know your store layout

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.380 
you've got you know your store layout
and<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.520> an<00:02:20.850> item<00:02:21.090> requires

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and you see here that an item requires

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.130 
and you see here that an item requires
restocking<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.260> i<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.620> over<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> shelf

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
restocking so i can go over to the shelf

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.770 
restocking so i can go over to the shelf
select<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> item<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.210> replenish<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.570> my

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
select the item and replenish it on my

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.380 
select the item and replenish it on my
mobile<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.970> i<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> order<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.750> units

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
mobile so i can order some more units

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.050 
mobile so i can order some more units
and<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.710> this<00:02:33.860> application<00:02:34.700> could<00:02:34.880> be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
and you know this application could be

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.240 
and you know this application could be
tied<00:02:35.420> into<00:02:35.630> your<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:36.319> your<00:02:36.380> inventory<00:02:36.890> system

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
some of the productivity apps on the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.690 
some of the productivity apps on the
media<00:02:44.750> side<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.020> we've<00:02:45.830> got<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> media<00:02:46.340> player

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.240 

so<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:50.150> go<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:51.410> play<00:02:51.590> music<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:52.100> can
