00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.299 

I'm<00:00:04.710> going<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.920> demonstrate<00:00:05.009> how<00:00:05.550> to<00:00:05.580> make<00:00:05.880> a

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
I'm going to demonstrate how to make a

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.510 
I'm going to demonstrate how to make a
extension<00:00:08.309> Campbell<00:00:08.820> for<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.420> scangauge<00:00:09.750> too

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
extension Campbell for the scangauge too

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.220 
extension Campbell for the scangauge too
now<00:00:11.520> what<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.180> is<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.570> computer

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
now what it really is is a computer

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.349 
now what it really is is a computer
extension<00:00:13.830> cable<00:00:15.260> like<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> network<00:00:16.710> cable<00:00:17.359> not

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
extension cable like a network cable not

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:28.210 
extension cable like a network cable not
a<00:00:18.390> whole<00:00:18.570> lot<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.759> and<00:00:20.759> as<00:00:21.179> it<00:00:21.329> turns<00:00:21.539> out

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:37.020 

jump<00:00:29.220> out

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.650 

there

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.960 

nice<00:00:44.350> these<00:00:44.680> colors<00:00:45.040> aren't<00:00:45.280> what<00:00:45.760> I<00:00:45.790> was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
nice these colors aren't what I was

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.549 
nice these colors aren't what I was
expecting

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:13.250 

layers

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.670 

well<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.430> luck<00:01:14.610> sorting<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.120> one<00:01:15.330> out

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
well good luck sorting this one out

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.350 
well good luck sorting this one out
these<00:01:16.680> colors<00:01:17.070> aren't<00:01:17.280> standardized

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.899 

funtage<00:01:21.140> wires

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.160 

anyway<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.899> it<00:01:28.020> should<00:01:28.049> work<00:01:28.289> is<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.960> is

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
anyway the way it should work is this is

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.460 
anyway the way it should work is this is
white<00:01:31.890> orange<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.119> orange

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.370 

then<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.280> white<00:01:41.490> green<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.660> got<00:01:42.810> two

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
then we got white green we got two

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.840 
then we got white green we got two
colors<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.980> totally<00:01:44.160> non-standard

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
colors that are totally non-standard

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690 
colors that are totally non-standard
they<00:01:44.940> were<00:01:45.030> supposed<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.510> blue<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.700> n

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
they were supposed to be blue and n

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
they were supposed to be blue and n
brown<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.380> we're<00:01:49.560> doing<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.830> straight

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
brown now because we're doing a straight

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
brown now because we're doing a straight
through<00:01:50.550> all<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.910> have<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.120> do<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.360> identify

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
through all you have to do is identify

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.590 
through all you have to do is identify
which<00:01:52.110> ones<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.420> sure

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
which ones are which and then make sure

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.900 
which ones are which and then make sure
that<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> same<00:02:00.110> sequence<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.320> wires

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
that you do the same sequence of wires

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.580 
that you do the same sequence of wires
on<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.090> other<00:02:03.240> end<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.400> white<00:02:05.400> orange<00:02:05.700> orange

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
on the other end so white orange orange

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.070 
on the other end so white orange orange
white<00:02:07.590> green<00:02:07.860> white

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.890 

bun<00:02:13.080> known<00:02:13.410> white<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.280> guess<00:02:14.700> blue<00:02:15.000> white<00:02:15.239> /

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
bun known white I guess blue white /

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
bun known white I guess blue white /
white<00:02:16.080> blue<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.349> then<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:17.790> supposed<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
white blue and then that was supposed to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
white blue and then that was supposed to
be<00:02:18.209> blue<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.900> don't<00:02:19.080> look<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.230> no<00:02:19.500> blue

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
be blue but it don't look like no blue

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.440 
be blue but it don't look like no blue
to<00:02:19.800> me

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.860 

then<00:02:23.450> white<00:02:23.690> brown<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.350> brown<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.630> once<00:02:26.810> you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
then white brown and brown so once you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.480 
then white brown and brown so once you
get<00:02:26.990> them<00:02:27.110> all<00:02:27.200> lined<00:02:27.410> up<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.830> pinch<00:02:28.280> them<00:02:28.430> in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
get them all lined up you pinch them in

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.520 
get them all lined up you pinch them in
your<00:02:28.580> thumb<00:02:28.760> like<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.780> kind<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.080> draw

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
your thumb like this you kind of draw

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.430 
your thumb like this you kind of draw
them<00:02:30.650> together<00:02:31.930> what<00:02:32.930> you're<00:02:33.080> trying<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.320> do

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
them together what you're trying to do

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.080 
them together what you're trying to do
is<00:02:33.560> get<00:02:33.710> them<00:02:33.800> all<00:02:33.980> lined<00:02:34.220> up<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.910> they're

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
is get them all lined up so that they're

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.270 
is get them all lined up so that they're
easy<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.540> clip<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.760> insert<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.790> into<00:02:38.000> a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
easy to clip and insert it into a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.020 
easy to clip and insert it into a
connector<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:42.200> that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.759 

take<00:02:48.030> some<00:02:48.239> regular<00:02:48.569> little<00:02:48.659> snips<00:02:51.650> cut<00:02:52.650> them

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
take some regular little snips cut them

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.369 
take some regular little snips cut them
off<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.129> got<00:02:53.540> about<00:02:54.540> five<00:02:54.870> eighths<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.260> an

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
off so you got about five eighths of an

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:06.030 
off so you got about five eighths of an
inch<00:02:56.810> about<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.019> much

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.430 

then<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.190> hold<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.520> thing<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.450> connector

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
then you hold the thing so the connector

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.470 
then you hold the thing so the connector
so<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> pins<00:03:10.220> all<00:03:10.730> face-up<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:16.480> this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
so if the pins all face-up and you this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.610 
so if the pins all face-up and you this
happens<00:03:17.840> every<00:03:17.959> once<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.440> while<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:20.620> couple

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
happens every once in a while a couple

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.710 
happens every once in a while a couple
of<00:03:21.920> pent<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.370> couple<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.910> wires<00:03:23.090> will<00:03:23.360> end<00:03:23.510> up

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
of pent a couple of wires will end up

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.050 
of pent a couple of wires will end up
getting<00:03:24.560> twisted<00:03:28.780> okay<00:03:30.730> once<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.819> get<00:03:31.940> them

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
getting twisted okay once you get them

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.840 
getting twisted okay once you get them
flat

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.230 

then<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.690> shove<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.960> man<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:38.310> what<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.640> do<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.910> I

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
then you shove a man and what I do is I

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.520 
then you shove a man and what I do is I
I<00:03:41.270> apply<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.300> little<00:03:42.570> pressure<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
I apply a little pressure so that the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.080 
I apply a little pressure so that the
wires<00:03:43.740> are<00:03:43.890> all<00:03:44.160> pushing<00:03:44.400> up<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.850> way<00:03:45.060> a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
wires are all pushing up this way a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.560 
wires are all pushing up this way a
little<00:03:45.180> bit<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.850> then<00:03:47.910> once<00:03:48.240> i<00:03:48.330> get<00:03:48.450> them

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
little bit and then once i get them

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.050 
little bit and then once i get them
shoved<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:50.100> can<00:03:51.500> visually<00:03:52.850> check<00:03:53.850> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
shoved in you can visually check the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.330 
shoved in you can visually check the
make<00:03:54.210> sure<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.630> nothing's<00:03:54.990> turned<00:03:55.260> around

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.320

you're just watching to make sure that

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.960 
you're just watching to make sure that
the<00:04:48.010> wires<00:04:49.010> are<00:04:49.310> rolling<00:04:49.700> in<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.940> right

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
the wires are rolling in the right

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.970 
the wires are rolling in the right
sequence<00:04:50.390> and<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.260> get<00:04:51.410> lights<00:04:51.680> every

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
sequence and that you get lights every

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.520 
sequence and that you get lights every
time<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:54.560> one<00:04:54.710> over<00:04:54.740> here<00:04:56.260> this<00:04:57.260> one's

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
time it get one over here this one's

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.290 
time it get one over here this one's
working<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.220> I'm<00:04:58.340> ready<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.730> test<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.090> on<00:04:59.150> the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
working so I'm ready to test it on the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.740 
working so I'm ready to test it on the
skin<00:04:59.510> gauge<00:05:03.880> all<00:05:04.880> right<00:05:04.970> well<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.150> got<00:05:05.360> my<00:05:05.480> scan

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
skin gauge all right well I got my scan

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.120 
skin gauge all right well I got my scan
gauge<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.260> here<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:08.650> there's<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:10.070> cable<00:05:12.130> with

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
gauge to here and there's the cable with

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.800 
gauge to here and there's the cable with
the<00:05:13.160> connector<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.270> goes<00:05:14.330> into<00:05:14.660> the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
the connector that goes into the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.920 
the connector that goes into the
scangauge<00:05:15.140> k2<00:05:15.920> and<00:05:16.280> lo<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:16.910> behold<00:05:17.000> that

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
scangauge k2 and lo and behold that

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.350 
scangauge k2 and lo and behold that
looks<00:05:18.290> just<00:05:18.410> exactly<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:19.100> an<00:05:19.460> rj45

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
looks just exactly like an rj45

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:28.530 
looks just exactly like an rj45
connector<00:05:21.610> now<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:22.640> bought<00:05:24.490> an<00:05:25.490> rj45<00:05:26.420> coupler

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
connector now I bought an rj45 coupler

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.600 
connector now I bought an rj45 coupler
just<00:05:29.540> a<00:05:29.630> little<00:05:29.870> female<00:05:30.230> a<00:05:30.440> female<00:05:31.010> connector

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
just a little female a female connector

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.150 
just a little female a female connector
so<00:05:32.480> I'm<00:05:32.600> going<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.810> plug<00:05:34.540> one<00:05:35.540> end<00:05:35.570> of<00:05:35.900> the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
so I'm going to plug one end of the

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.630 
so I'm going to plug one end of the
extension<00:05:37.160> cable<00:05:37.490> in<00:05:37.670> and<00:05:38.500> then<00:05:39.500> to<00:05:40.160> the<00:05:40.280> cable

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
extension cable in and then to the cable

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.620 
extension cable in and then to the cable
where<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.650> we're<00:05:42.650> going<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:43.330> see<00:05:44.330> if<00:05:44.480> this

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
where and we're going to see if this

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.380 
where and we're going to see if this
works

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.330 

there<00:05:52.080> you<00:05:52.170> go<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:53.120> got<00:05:54.120> lights<00:05:54.770> now<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:55.800> realize

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
there you go I got lights now I realize

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.400 
there you go I got lights now I realize
some<00:05:56.640> of<00:05:56.670> the<00:05:56.790> tools<00:05:57.000> that<00:05:57.300> I<00:05:57.450> use<00:05:57.540> to<00:05:57.810> make

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
some of the tools that I use to make

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.430 
some of the tools that I use to make
this<00:05:58.590> cable<00:05:58.980> our<00:05:59.480> specialty<00:06:00.480> tools<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:01.110> you

is<00:06:04.710> go<00:06:04.860> down<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.190> radio<00:06:05.490> shack<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:06.110> buy<00:06:07.110> a

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
is go down to radio shack and buy a

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.920 
is go down to radio shack and buy a
computer<00:06:10.280> network<00:06:11.280> cable<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.600> make<00:06:12.900> sure

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
computer network cable and make sure

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.950 
computer network cable and make sure
that<00:06:13.280> when<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.400> do<00:06:14.550> that<00:06:14.760> just<00:06:15.360> look<00:06:15.630> at<00:06:15.780> the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
that when you do that just look at the

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.000 
that when you do that just look at the
the<00:06:16.470> wires<00:06:17.310> inside<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.680> connector<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.830> make

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
the wires inside the connector and make

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.260 
the wires inside the connector and make
sure<00:06:20.040> that<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.670> the<00:06:21.360> wires<00:06:21.600> all<00:06:22.760> are<00:06:23.760> in<00:06:24.120> the

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
sure that the the wires all are in the

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.300 
sure that the the wires all are in the
same<00:06:24.450> sequence<00:06:24.990> there's<00:06:25.500> two<00:06:25.890> types<00:06:26.160> of

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
same sequence there's two types of

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.070 
same sequence there's two types of
network<00:06:26.610> connections<00:06:27.090> one<00:06:27.450> is<00:06:27.750> called<00:06:27.960> a

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
network connections one is called a

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.750 
network connections one is called a
rollover<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:28.710> the<00:06:28.860> other<00:06:28.980> one<00:06:29.250> is<00:06:29.280> called<00:06:29.640> a

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
rollover and the other one is called a

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.060 
rollover and the other one is called a
straight<00:06:29.970> through<00:06:30.560> now<00:06:31.560> they<00:06:31.770> have<00:06:32.090> actual

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
straight through now they have actual

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.740 
straight through now they have actual
number<00:06:35.070> designations<00:06:35.730> but<00:06:36.300> that's<00:06:36.480> the

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
number designations but that's the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:46.220 
number designations but that's the
common<00:06:37.140> terminology<00:06:44.510> well<00:06:45.510> there<00:06:45.930> you<00:06:45.960> can

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
common terminology well there you can

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.770 
common terminology well there you can
see<00:06:46.410> it<00:06:46.560> i'm<00:06:46.740> running<00:06:46.770> a<00:06:47.310> thousand<00:06:47.940> little

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
see it i'm running a thousand little

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.730 
see it i'm running a thousand little
over<00:06:49.050> a<00:06:49.080> thousand<00:06:49.500> RPM<00:06:49.950> and<00:06:50.690> using<00:06:51.740> three

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
over a thousand RPM and using three

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.350 
over a thousand RPM and using three
quarters<00:06:53.070> of<00:06:53.100> a<00:06:53.340> gallon<00:06:53.640> per<00:06:53.790> hour<00:06:53.970> just

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
quarters of a gallon per hour just

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.410 
quarters of a gallon per hour just
idling<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:55.550> it<00:06:56.550> should<00:06:56.910> be<00:06:56.940> pretty<00:06:57.210> obvious

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
idling and it should be pretty obvious

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:05.360 
idling and it should be pretty obvious
it's<00:06:57.900> not<00:06:58.080> in<00:06:58.260> truck

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.900 

there's<00:07:06.060> a<00:07:06.210> truck

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:19.250 

so<00:07:09.510> cable<00:07:09.960> works

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.320
