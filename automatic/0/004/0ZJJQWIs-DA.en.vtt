00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
microns of particles pulls them out any
of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> oil<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> compressor<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.859> go

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of the oil and the compressor then we go

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.340 
of the oil and the compressor then we go
into<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> coalescing<00:01:41.759> filter<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.840> takes<00:01:43.140> out

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
into a coalescing filter this takes out

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.240 
into a coalescing filter this takes out
to<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:44.460> hundredth<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.869> micron<00:01:46.320> gets<00:01:47.070> all

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to one hundredth of a micron gets all

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
to one hundredth of a micron gets all
that<00:01:47.369> oil<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.179> out<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.719> there<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.590> we

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that oil and so on out of there then we

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.789 
that oil and so on out of there then we
move<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.520> 2<00:01:50.969> quart<00:01:51.210> desiccant<00:01:51.780> filter<00:01:52.109> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
move into a 2 quart desiccant filter and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.469 
move into a 2 quart desiccant filter and
of<00:01:52.950> course<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.219> removes<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> moisture<00:01:53.969> in

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
of course this removes the moisture in

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
of course this removes the moisture in
any<00:01:54.840> aerosol<00:01:55.439> oils<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.789> all<00:01:56.939> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
any aerosol oils so if you have all of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.560 
any aerosol oils so if you have all of
these<00:01:57.149> together<00:01:57.359> combined<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:58.920> remove

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
these together combined they will remove

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.529 
these together combined they will remove
99.97%<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> moisture<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.939> oil<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
99.97% of the moisture the oil and the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.450 
99.97% of the moisture the oil and the
debris<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.679> what<00:02:04.950> comes<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> your

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
debris so we what comes out of your

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.389 
debris so we what comes out of your
airline<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.299> pure<00:02:06.719> air<00:02:07.079> great<00:02:08.070> for<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
airline is just pure air great for a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.460 
airline is just pure air great for a
paint<00:02:08.610> job<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.360> don't<00:02:09.509> skimp<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> dryer<00:02:10.200> get

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
paint job so don't skimp on a dryer get

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.690 
paint job so don't skimp on a dryer get
a<00:02:10.500> good<00:02:10.709> dryer<00:02:10.920> they've<00:02:11.159> got<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:11.370> kinds<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a good dryer they've got all kinds of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.780 
a good dryer they've got all kinds of
combinations<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.480> buy<00:02:12.599> from
