00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.940
 good people here you have a video in the 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.890
 I'm going to explain what spam is 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.870
 valley what factors influence the time 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.760
 whether the gesture occurs or not is 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.800
 when you ask the play and the white 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.020
 1 and 2 ok I do not know if in other games happens 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.720
 but well that's when you ask for more 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.070
 data that they can move then 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.690
 I explain when you get a high round 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.280
 there are many more many more data 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.619
 it's worth the zombies have more life to 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.870
 all of that has to be calculated 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.850
 accumulated more claimed you have more things 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.730
 more drinks more weapons more of everything 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.110
 then you demand more to match then it is worth 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.420
 there comes a time when it can be that 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.430
 you say high I can not anymore I give you an error 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.559
 and you start over why why not 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.780
 of pando the for everything is better in this 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.970
 case if you notice just before dying or 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.000
 be right before they do it is pound my 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.530
 mate here I hope you were going to die 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 worth and in fact died on your screen the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.840
 I who died 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.060
 and that was the last straw as if we were saying 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.570
 that takes a little bit the limit and when 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.570
 step that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.890
 come on it's finished and said up here 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.840
 start again because you have passed 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.929
 You have asked for more data than 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.359
 which you can then accumulate 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.850
 many claypool if you activate traps and 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.829
 you die too, or whatever it is 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.020
 work for the play that affects vale 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.490
 then if it will always happen to you in rounds 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.530
 high especially in low rounds will be 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.149
 very difficult because not because not because 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.909
 take has less life also that has 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.920
 that influence a lot 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.520
 and many things better then if you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.770
 you set here on the rise 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 to see in immediate war while he is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.490
 doing the answers the zombies also 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 a friend said it said alvarito that the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.329
 truth is that it controls a lot of this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.829
 when you look for example in this case 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.509
 if you notice the raisin 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.579
 I'm going to pass and I was going to die for sure 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.799
 he gave us six for a he 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.700
 although I was the one who died that everything but 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.600
 that was because watching there were zombies 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.100
 reappearing because they were dying 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.590
 that catches zombies dying with the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.569
 trap the trap activates the dogs that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.090
 there is in the rise that there is no seat 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.489
 rice that there are many and that is work 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.340
 for the play in calÃ³ will have for example 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.280
 the georges causes many spawn because 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.079
 it's also work for the play then 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.970
 in this case it was because of the accumulation of everything or 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.540
 be if in addition to this repair zombies 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.849
 dying dogs trap everything if in addition you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.400
 you die that does since the same thing that we 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.400
 It happened in train in die rice are worth two 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.190
 that says up here because because 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.620
 I can no longer bother you and so popular 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.629
 the putada that in whites two in white 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.040
 is one does not keep the record in whites 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.480
 two we were lucky and if at least 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.760
 but good for that are the videos 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.830
 to show the records so nothing 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.750
 I hope that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.640
 pound any doubt you already know that the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.160
 comments I read them and I answer 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.810
 whenever I can and nothing else I hope that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.810
 you liked it, see you
