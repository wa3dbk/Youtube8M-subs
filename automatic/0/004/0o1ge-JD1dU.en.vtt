00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.080
 hi friends in this video we are going to 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.549
 to show 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.830
 an application for my taste very good 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.000
 that allows us to change the appearance of 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.380
 our iphone 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.380
 I installed him by cydia 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.990
 let's go to sources 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.750
 this is the application in sachet ep of 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.900
 points 2 bars apt point 91 point 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.900
 com 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.290
 they have a lot of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.970
 applications and below all 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.970
 this I have a salad 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.770
 let's go to the application 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 this little tab here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.399
 we hope not 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.399
 we have the themes 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.350
 here to download more if they want 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.370
 and they have at cost 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.390
 by payment or for free 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 that would be the themes 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.500
 and then on this tab here 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.180
 we have the possibility to hide icons 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.180
 these are all those that I have hidden 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 and this is here only that I have 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.920
 visible all these 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 let's go back 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.409
 here we have the nightmare of options 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.469
 advanced where we have a quantity 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.600
 considerable to make the changes 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.619
 relevant we want 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.619
 we go back 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.680
 and we are going to here of this 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.100
 it's from here it would be for the bar here 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.860
 down either left or right put 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.330
 the icons that we want those are the ones that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.780
 we use in the previous line to 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.780
 block and unlock 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.530
 Let 's go back to this again 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.780
 well this here would be 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.760
 the notification center where 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.160
 we can put the icons we want 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.740
 that would be the one that comes from above 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.650
 so you can see how 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.490
 can be changed in the icon we choose 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.490
 for example this 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.340
 we apply 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.870
 we give back 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.989
 and here we have to give it to rewrite 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.989
 he asks us to confirm we are going to ok 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 give a little bit since we already have 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.360
 to the new fund 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.360
 with the time of day 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.980
 the battery percentage that we have left 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.740
 we have analyze and block everything the same 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.240
 everything works fine 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.230
 sitting notifications that we said 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.230
 before 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.130
 in the bottom bar both on one side 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.620
 as for another to the right 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.730
 and this has been the video we are waiting for you in 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 next one
