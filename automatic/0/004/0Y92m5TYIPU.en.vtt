can<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.849> slippery<00:02:30.150> guy<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.959> isn't<00:02:31.319> a

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
can be a slippery guy so this isn't a

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.140 
can be a slippery guy so this isn't a
bad<00:02:31.530> idea<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.099> have<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.400> give<00:02:32.550> chase<00:02:32.849> but

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
bad idea if I have to give chase but

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.420 
bad idea if I have to give chase but
after<00:02:33.840> throwing<00:02:34.079> in<00:02:34.319> my<00:02:34.409> face<00:02:34.650> punch<00:02:34.980> combo

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
after throwing in my face punch combo

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.160 
after throwing in my face punch combo
low-key<00:02:35.849> blows<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.359> lot<00:02:36.599> faster<00:02:36.810> than

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
low-key blows up a lot faster than

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.700 
low-key blows up a lot faster than
expected

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
expected

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.500 
expected
and<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> only<00:02:38.100> takes<00:02:38.370> one<00:02:38.520> additional<00:02:39.120> attack

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
and it only takes one additional attack

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:52.700 
and it only takes one additional attack
to<00:02:39.780> take<00:02:39.960> me<00:02:40.110> down<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.990> let's<00:02:52.170> take<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> look<00:02:52.620> at

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710

Artemis coming up to try and kill for I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.700 
Artemis coming up to try and kill for I
know<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.750> she<00:02:57.870> doesn't<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.320> much<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.680> the
