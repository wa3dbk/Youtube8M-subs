Tell us about the fight.

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:29.069
At first, my head was injured, but after that I had fun in the fight.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:57.639
It looked like your opponent had the advantage in the first half. Were you worried about that?

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:48.848
Exactly. He has serious skills and so I tried to be well prepared. That led to my victory, I believe. 

00:02:22.647 --> 00:02:29.564
What kind of preparation?

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:54.949
I watched many of his fights.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:32.016
How was your first K-1 fight.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:35.645
I'm so glad I got to be in to the Final 8. When my opponent is chosen at the drawing tomorrow, I'll do my best to train for him.

00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:06.004
Who of the other seven do you want to fight?

00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:31.782
I've trained so hard, that I'm confident I could beat anyone. I'm really happy I can be in the tournament. I'll do my best, so be sure to cheer for me.
