out<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> grease<00:00:35.399> I'm<00:00:35.640> slightly<00:00:35.910> above

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
out to the grease I'm slightly above

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
out to the grease I'm slightly above
then<00:00:37.050> taking<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> silver<00:00:37.920> base<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.430> just

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
then taking a silver base I'm just

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.010 
then taking a silver base I'm just
applying<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> inner<00:00:39.989> corner

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
applying this right in the inner corner

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.590 
applying this right in the inner corner
and<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.010> reason<00:00:41.399> why<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.730> using<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.149> base<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and the reason why I'm using a base is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
and the reason why I'm using a base is
because<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> silver<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.040> too

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because the silver is a little bit too

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.490 
because the silver is a little bit too
powdery<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.510> pigmented<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.350> would

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
powdery and not as pigmented as I would

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.220 
powdery and not as pigmented as I would
like<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:49.820> went<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.480> thick<00:00:51.809> winged
