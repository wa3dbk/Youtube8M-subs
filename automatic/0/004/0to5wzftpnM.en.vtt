you go into the muscle with the needle
yeah<00:04:31.380> people<00:04:31.770> get<00:04:32.220> definitely<00:04:33.180> will<00:04:33.300> get<00:04:33.419> more

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
yeah people get definitely will get more

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.900 
yeah people get definitely will get more
pain<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.650> process<00:04:35.190> gonna<00:04:35.460> tighten<00:04:35.820> when

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
pain in the process gonna tighten when

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.820 
pain in the process gonna tighten when
done<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.630> tight<00:04:36.840> muscles<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.560> that's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
done and the tight muscles so that's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.150 
done and the tight muscles so that's
what<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.250> do<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.580> feel<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.850> difference<00:04:40.160> is

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
what we do you feel the difference is

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.020 
what we do you feel the difference is
subtle<00:04:41.639> but<00:04:41.790> yes<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.330> right<00:04:42.990> there<00:04:44.030> okay

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
subtle but yes I think right there okay

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.439 
subtle but yes I think right there okay
so<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.979> so<00:04:47.250> that's<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.699> technique<00:04:48.090> we<00:04:48.300> will

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
so so so that's the technique we will

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.200 
so so so that's the technique we will
put<00:04:48.600> band-aids<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.169> there<00:04:49.729> so<00:04:50.729> that<00:04:50.760> the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
put band-aids on there so that the

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.430 
put band-aids on there so that the
cervical<00:04:51.750> injection<00:04:52.340> works<00:04:53.340> fairly<00:04:54.030> fast<00:04:54.539> on

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
cervical injection works fairly fast on

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.820 
cervical injection works fairly fast on
