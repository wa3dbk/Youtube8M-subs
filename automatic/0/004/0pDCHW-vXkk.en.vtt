00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.780
 le 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.720
 bea 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.730
 Yes Hello everyone is Fe Weiss for I windows 8 is this time 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.750
 I'm going to talk 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.740
 It is said that people who used windows 8 started 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 It is a bit confusing 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.239
 When the screen turn off the power It is especially is I shut down and listen to the story to say Toka has changed 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 Function menu is troublesome 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:42.960
 It is usually used afterward 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:47.820
 office It is a product micro software also but I want to use the Toka illegal goods 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 It's annoying to go from the first screen for that purpose 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.380
 Than to hear that kind of talk it is or that you can not easily I want a shirt bullets 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.950
 Yeah attached to the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:04.470
 Depending on the way it is not that kind of thing in the way and when you start the decline 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.680
 To the desktop 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 Start the stop at the program 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.830
 That can shut down from there after using the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.520
 I think that even that's possible attempt to situations today 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:24.370
 It is as you Zonchi first windows 8 but what is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:29.440
 First of all, when I got up on my face, it's different from conventional ones. 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.770
 I think that I am conscious of a smartphone and shut up like this in a tablet or something 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.630
 I will 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 I will not drink like this to better after right 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:44.530
 These Apu 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.530
 Well, this one is conventional 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.430
 Proggar running on the desktop 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.090
 I think 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.370
 So there is a command of good desktop in eco and start desktop porter 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.240
 When 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:09.649
 It is conventional windows 7 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.459
 When the screen, such as was using in windows xp come out the screen you were seen out 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.130
 think 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:18.130
 It's menu is unlikely start-up menu to a Coco's in issue here 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.690
 There is no start menu 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:31.460
 Taking once since because according It is in Tsu This is not even shut down 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.210
 It is said to shut down from the setting, but this is possible 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.380
 To do 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.380
 There is an application is a free layer and using this 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.340
 Instead of this screen, this screen opens suddenly when the power is turned on. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.750
 Menu Moetto it and will come out menu 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.050
 Shut down from the menu is as usual windows 8 and beta 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.460
 7 with roses Pibi So you star, etc. 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:04.850
 The end of a desktop similar to the original 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:06.380
 It is no need to go back to the here and can also be terminated from there When you are finished with the business 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.960
 It is room by youth 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.200
 that 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.250
 I think it is usually possible on the desktop 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.920
 a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.630
 Who is and asked to install a so kind of application you want to support only desktop 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.770
 a 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.000
 Skip this Oh and Sha from the desktop me on this screen desktop 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.130
 It will be that the shutdown can be 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.680
 Yes 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.519
