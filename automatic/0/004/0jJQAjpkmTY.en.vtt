 because I want a species here soon 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.770
 storage room going down here 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.229
 so we are going to make roux for a while and then 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.030
 let's see how far we get 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.070
 and I need that in a driver 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.840
 super chill of course 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.210
 show you feel that i'm quick and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.619
 need a storage room because it is 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.330
 really nothing at all with it 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.670
 searching items 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080
 ok now I see so have new show 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.510
 to make shapes so I'll grab something 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.799
 eggs and hold I probably still have 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.280
 yes we can quickly make a show full 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.280
 oh what am i doing 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.720
 what you do not need through of course so 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 I have indeed in the nether yes 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.860
 what I understand there is a Christmas 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 time with a flew is a cherry above it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
 cottage that we have in the nether 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 made really just half in the cottage 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.580
 half outside 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.010
 really fucking weird i am by him 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.290
 hit it and I also died 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.320
 he shot me like the chariot of the mountain 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.600
 Occasionally I therefore span all the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.100
 in the back that snowboy him and I don't know 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.360
 I just slept in my best me 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.120
 do not know what is going on but 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.820
 my bed has been reset 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.830
 so i have to sleep again but i can 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.510
 not because it is day but we don't 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.080
 the reason i go yes i have a show 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.000
 full so we continue with that room and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
 whatnot idea is we go in first 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.810
 all the way up to that we're outside 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.870
 come out there we first go into the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.820
 to look at how far the dike 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.920
 about that little bit of calling to it 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.440
 really so out marino 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.600
 ah there it is already nice what i during 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.850
 want to make here what i am up to it 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.970
 and is a kind of iphone bar 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.320
 window so then I can just from my 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.110
 while their I can go to the other side 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.730
 look down from the mountain and wait stop it 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.870
 have seen a spoiler and that is allowed 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.050
 not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.019
 probably so and we go here 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.019
 just but this is my house anyway 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.489
 dick well okay that I can already see that now 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.290
 you can't go further 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.440
 so we can do a little nati can 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.709
 not far because I will soon come to the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.250
 or to know too high there will be the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.630
 storage room sorry and my here we go 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.670
 so the patient has to make that is well 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.640
 a bit smaller unfortunately I did n't have it 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.019
 so thought but just because it 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.670
 house sits there and there comes there 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.340
 storage room I see it no different 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.920
 but he goes a little higher 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.060
 because it is a bit small and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.420
 prohibit your live tooling 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:39.720
 oh lol shirt the door the farmer after 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.140
 so and slowly my house is getting bigger 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.489
 and slowly I really want to go up 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.810
 go with my house because i now have one 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.540
 neighbor you just got the little one 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.300
 spoiler seen and what a fun 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.160
 The idea was seemed to be this mountain and all the way 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.470
 to cultivate with other pieces that do not 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.450
 built entirely cultivate 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.239
 and just make the perks super eye-catching 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.980
 that he just stands out if you like you 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.900
 looks around the server here so that 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.410
 church falls then ron that must be my very much 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.959
 stand out that is rich the idea the behind 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.519
 but this looks empty to your eyes 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.799
 probably my seat 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.630
 squatting well look what i can do i can 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.120
 this wall the out to that they see anyway 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.729
 don't stand at jeunesse for oh 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.729
 shit oh shit to diesel 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.919
 what are you going to do there will take this away 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.570
 and then we go here for now just one 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.130
 put block because here I will have your skin 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.640
 with a loop not in event 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.470
 this can probably also be correct 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.660
 and we can probably do this too 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.220
 take away 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.220
 lift hear watch 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.660
 just right just I'm talking fucking 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.479
 chill 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.300
 we're going to be a new bergsma side 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.460
 of course important there the sticks 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.180
 but we have no way of our own 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.180
 I still have detection 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.469
 no we no longer have a pickaxe 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.669
 too bad then we have to get one first 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:08.509
 make me very quickly so thick it 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.819
 is going to do is decorate the potion 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.800
 room outdoor recordings for a recording of 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.780
 We have 16 minutes at the first 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.960
 seen the episode every four hours to 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.460
 brakes and this just too long so me 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.689
 quickly finishes the room with it 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.930
 carve into it and then I stop 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.759
 episode and that is now with flash 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.560
