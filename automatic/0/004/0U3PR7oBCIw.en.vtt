the<00:00:03.820> cup<00:00:04.090> has<00:00:04.120> dried<00:00:04.600> up<00:00:04.630> for<00:00:05.020> seven<00:00:05.350> hours<00:00:05.529> so

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.490 
the cup has dried up for seven hours so

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.279 
the cup has dried up for seven hours so
now<00:00:06.669> we<00:00:06.730> can<00:00:07.089> remove<00:00:07.240> the<00:00:07.450> tube<00:00:07.930> from<00:00:08.230> it<00:00:10.289> and

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:11.289 
now we can remove the tube from it and

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.220 
now we can remove the tube from it and
at<00:00:11.799> this<00:00:11.980> point<00:00:12.369> what<00:00:12.639> we<00:00:12.670> want<00:00:13.000> to<00:00:13.209> do<00:00:13.420> is<00:00:13.779> add

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
at this point what we want to do is add

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.130 
at this point what we want to do is add
to<00:00:14.619> the<00:00:14.709> inside<00:00:15.309> reinforcement<00:00:16.270> coils<00:00:16.630> do<00:00:17.020> you

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
to the inside reinforcement coils do you

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.230 
to the inside reinforcement coils do you
want<00:00:17.289> to<00:00:17.380> add<00:00:17.470> a<00:00:17.500> reinforcement<00:00:17.859> boil<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:19.210> the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
want to add a reinforcement boil to the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.070 
want to add a reinforcement boil to the
bottom<00:00:19.720> seam<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.439> to<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.220> side<00:00:21.460> seam<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
bottom seam and to the side seam and

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.230 
bottom seam and to the side seam and
because<00:00:23.589> the<00:00:23.830> cup<00:00:24.070> has<00:00:24.279> dried<00:00:24.550> up<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:25.029> little

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
because the cup has dried up a little

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.470 
because the cup has dried up a little
bit<00:00:25.509> we<00:00:25.990> need<00:00:26.169> to<00:00:26.320> score<00:00:26.679> those<00:00:27.429> two<00:00:27.699> seams<00:00:28.029> as

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
bit we need to score those two seams as

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.300 
bit we need to score those two seams as
well<00:00:28.749> as<00:00:28.929> you<00:00:29.050> can<00:00:32.280> score<00:00:33.280> that<00:00:34.320> seam<00:00:35.320> might

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
well as you can score that seam might

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.340 
well as you can score that seam might
need<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.760> add<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:36.910> little<00:00:37.300> bit<00:00:37.630> of<00:00:37.660> moisture<00:00:38.050> to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
need to add a little bit of moisture to

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.250 
need to add a little bit of moisture to
it<00:00:38.710> maybe<00:00:39.100> not<00:00:39.370> it<00:00:39.520> depends<00:00:39.880> upon<00:00:39.970> how<00:00:40.260> wet

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
it maybe not it depends upon how wet

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.960 
it maybe not it depends upon how wet
your<00:00:41.440> cup<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:41.890> so<00:00:42.130> don't<00:00:42.280> add<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.550> lot<00:00:42.640> of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
your cup is so don't add a lot of

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.250 
your cup is so don't add a lot of
moisture<00:00:43.120> because<00:00:43.630> you<00:00:43.720> don't<00:00:43.900> want<00:00:44.050> water

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
moisture because you don't want water

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.740 
moisture because you don't want water
seeping<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:44.860> bottom<00:00:45.310> of<00:00:45.460> their<00:00:45.670> cup<00:00:45.910> then

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
seeping the bottom of their cup then

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.780 
seeping the bottom of their cup then
take<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.100> piece<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.310> clay<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:48.880> roll<00:00:49.120> out<00:00:49.390> a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
take a piece of clay and roll out a

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.570 
take a piece of clay and roll out a
reinforcement<00:00:52.740> that's<00:00:53.740> about<00:00:53.920> like<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.340> big

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
reinforcement that's about like that big

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.210 
reinforcement that's about like that big
and<00:00:55.570> what<00:00:55.690> you're<00:00:55.840> going<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.080> do<00:00:56.290> is<00:00:56.590> you're

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
and what you're going to do is you're

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.730 
and what you're going to do is you're
going<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.490> add<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:58.000> on<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:58.540> side<00:00:58.900> seam<00:00:59.380> and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
going to add it on that side seam and

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.990 
going to add it on that side seam and
then<00:01:00.730> down<00:01:01.000> in<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.420> bottom<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.320> cup<00:01:02.560> so<00:01:03.000> if

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
then down in the bottom of the cup so if

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.389 
then down in the bottom of the cup so if
you<00:01:04.239> get<00:01:04.449> where<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.619> body<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.189> cup

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
you get where the the body of the cup

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.849 
you get where the the body of the cup
meets<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.969> bottom<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.109> if<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.350> can't<00:01:08.590> reach

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
meets the bottom so if you can't reach

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.010 
meets the bottom so if you can't reach
your<00:01:09.039> hand<00:01:09.340> down<00:01:09.759> in<00:01:10.149> there<00:01:10.359> because<00:01:10.689> you<00:01:10.810> made

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
your hand down in there because you made

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.810 
your hand down in there because you made
a<00:01:11.049> cut<00:01:11.289> this<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.469> little<00:01:11.590> bit<00:01:11.950> thin<00:01:12.280> in<00:01:12.490> diameter

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
a cut this a little bit thin in diameter

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
a cut this a little bit thin in diameter
what<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:13.960> can<00:01:14.170> do<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.590> order<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.039> get<00:01:15.310> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
what you can do in order to get that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.609 
what you can do in order to get that
smooth<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.609> because<00:01:18.880> we<00:01:19.119> want<00:01:19.359> to<00:01:19.420> later<00:01:19.780> look

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
smooth it because we want to later look

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.919 
smooth it because we want to later look
at<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.829> inside<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.609> cup<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.569> should

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
at the inside of the cup and it should

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.859 
at the inside of the cup and it should
make<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:24.219> nice<00:01:24.520> transition<00:01:24.999> you<00:01:25.539> shouldn't

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
make a nice transition you shouldn't

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.480 
make a nice transition you shouldn't
really<00:01:26.020> be<00:01:26.109> able<00:01:26.319> to<00:01:26.469> see<00:01:26.710> where<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.920> seam<00:01:27.249> is

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
really be able to see where the seam is

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.899 
really be able to see where the seam is
down<00:01:27.789> there<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:30.719> take<00:01:31.719> this<00:01:32.249> wooden<00:01:33.249> tool<00:01:33.549> and

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
down there so take this wooden tool and

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.050 
down there so take this wooden tool and
as<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.079> race<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.189> from<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.520> outside<00:01:36.850> with

what<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.340> probably<00:02:11.880> want<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.840> put<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
what you probably want to do is put a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.310 
what you probably want to do is put a
tube<00:02:14.220> back<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.420> doesn't<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
tube back in it doesn't have to be the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.560 
tube back in it doesn't have to be the
same<00:02:16.560> size<00:02:16.830> tube<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.430> started<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.330> just

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
same size tube you started with is just

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.470 
same size tube you started with is just
a<00:02:18.750> tube<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.950> work<00:02:20.100> against<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.450> that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
a tube that you can work against so that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.930 
a tube that you can work against so that
the<00:02:21.840> cup<00:02:22.470> has<00:02:22.710> reinforcement<00:02:23.550> as<00:02:23.670> you're

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
the cup has reinforcement as you're

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
the cup has reinforcement as you're
putting<00:02:24.210> pressure<00:02:24.360> against<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.920> could

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
putting pressure against it so it could

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.940 
putting pressure against it so it could
even<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.910> smaller<00:02:27.390> -<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.710> that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
even be a smaller - like this that

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.890 
even be a smaller - like this that
you're<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.280> putting<00:02:29.550> next<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> part

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you're just putting next to the part

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.100 
you're just putting next to the part
that<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:31.260> adding<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.740> handle<00:02:32.990> for<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that you're adding the handle for the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.240 
that you're adding the handle for the
handle<00:02:36.050> I'm<00:02:37.050> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> show<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.860> technique

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
handle I'm going to show you a technique

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.280 
handle I'm going to show you a technique
that<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> am<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.300> sure<00:02:39.480> does<00:02:39.750> show<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:39.990> guys

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that I am not sure does show you guys

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.910 
that I am not sure does show you guys
that<00:02:40.530> -<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.100> handle<00:02:41.520> yet<00:02:41.760> for<00:02:42.660> your<00:02:42.900> pinch<00:02:43.680> pot

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
that - the handle yet for your pinch pot

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.660 
that - the handle yet for your pinch pot
for<00:02:44.220> your<00:02:44.400> pinch<00:02:44.880> pot<00:02:45.090> assignment<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:47.100> the

for your pinch pot assignment so the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.720 
for your pinch pot assignment so the
tube<00:02:47.940> handle<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.260> strap<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.280> clay<00:02:50.459> like

tube handle and a strap of clay like

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.199 
tube handle and a strap of clay like
this<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.190> Chris<00:02:53.190> Abele's<00:02:53.459> stepped<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
this and Chris Abele's stepped on it

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.550 
this and Chris Abele's stepped on it
with<00:02:54.330> her<00:02:54.510> tennis<00:02:55.020> shoe<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.440> this

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
with her tennis shoe to get this

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.670 
with her tennis shoe to get this
beautiful<00:02:55.980> texture<00:02:56.489> that's<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
beautiful texture that's on there and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.740 
beautiful texture that's on there and
I'm<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.640> stretch<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.150> down<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> little

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I'm going to stretch it down a little

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.640 
I'm going to stretch it down a little
bit<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.280> texture<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.300> even<00:03:03.840> more

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
bit just so the texture is even more

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
bit just so the texture is even more
interesting<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.520> me<00:03:07.820> let's<00:03:08.820> stretched<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.360> a

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
interesting to me let's stretched out a

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.620 
interesting to me let's stretched out a
little<00:03:09.630> bit<00:03:09.840> more<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.880> you're<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.300> use

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
little bit more and you're going to use

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.650 
little bit more and you're going to use
this<00:03:12.989> you're<00:03:13.440> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.860> roll<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:14.970> into<00:03:15.300> a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
this you're going to roll this into a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.130 
this you're going to roll this into a
tube<00:03:16.020> as<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.440> name<00:03:16.650> implies<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.750> little

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
tube as the name implies so this little

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.260 
tube as the name implies so this little
edge<00:03:19.350> here<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.190> edge<00:03:20.489> here<00:03:20.520> should<00:03:21.150> be

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
edge here and this edge here should be

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.940 
edge here and this edge here should be
thinner<00:03:21.600> than<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.170> body<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:24.290> handle<00:03:25.290> it's

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
thinner than the body of the handle it's

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.920 
thinner than the body of the handle it's
actually<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.520> miniature<00:03:27.060> version<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.690> what<00:03:27.900> you

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
actually a miniature version of what you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.810 
actually a miniature version of what you
did<00:03:28.200> for<00:03:28.230> your<00:03:28.470> Cup<00:03:28.800> where<00:03:29.340> you're<00:03:29.520> going<00:03:29.760> to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
did for your Cup where you're going to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.500 
did for your Cup where you're going to
overlap<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.230> we<00:03:31.830> want<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.220> score<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.120> back

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
overlap it so we want to score the back

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.890 
overlap it so we want to score the back
of<00:03:33.870> one<00:03:33.900> side<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.180> front<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
of one side of it and the front of the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.090 
of one side of it and the front of the
other<00:03:37.050> side<00:03:37.410> where<00:03:37.680> they're<00:03:37.800> going<00:03:38.010> to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
other side where they're going to

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.530 
other side where they're going to
overlap

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.949 

and<00:03:46.439> then<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.819> little<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.269> water<00:03:48.569> and

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
and then have a little bit of water and

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.410 
and then have a little bit of water and
score<00:03:49.379> again<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.610> have<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> slip

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
score again so that you have a slip

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.009 
score again so that you have a slip
buildup<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.349> surface<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.640> handle

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.080 

this<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.470> an<00:03:58.680> example<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.310> one<00:03:59.730> type<00:04:00.060> of

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
this is just an example of one type of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.350 
this is just an example of one type of
handle<00:04:00.659> that<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.110> all<00:04:01.290> can<00:04:01.500> put<00:04:01.739> on<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.360> pots

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
handle that you all can put on your pots

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.390 
handle that you all can put on your pots
it<00:04:03.720> doesn't<00:04:04.110> necessarily<00:04:04.769> have<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.950> be<00:04:05.099> this

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
it doesn't necessarily have to be this

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.280 
it doesn't necessarily have to be this
one<00:04:05.640> I'm<00:04:06.269> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.599> show<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.079> few

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
one I'm going to show you in a few

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.250 
one I'm going to show you in a few
minutes<00:04:07.680> other<00:04:08.480> examples<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.629> handles<00:04:10.140> that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
minutes other examples of handles that

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.380 
minutes other examples of handles that
you<00:04:10.409> can<00:04:10.590> do<00:04:10.739> which<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.310> covered<00:04:11.849> with<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
you can do which I covered with the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.050 
you can do which I covered with the
first<00:04:12.659> assignment<00:04:13.290> in<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> pinch<00:04:13.799> pot<00:04:14.069> so

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
first assignment in the pinch pot so

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:26.450 
first assignment in the pinch pot so
we're<00:04:15.180> just<00:04:15.359> rolling<00:04:15.569> up<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.169> handle<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:26.370> as

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
we're just rolling up this handle so as

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.750 
we're just rolling up this handle so as
the<00:04:26.610> name<00:04:26.760> implies<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.449> little<00:04:27.780> tube<00:04:28.050> and

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.550 

then<00:04:32.760> I'm<00:04:33.090> going<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.449> size<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.990> up<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.350> put<00:04:34.530> it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
then I'm going to size it up to put it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.860 
then I'm going to size it up to put it
on<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.919> side<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.340> my<00:04:35.520> pot<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.750> my<00:04:36.930> cup<00:04:38.720> put<00:04:39.720> this

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
on the side of my pot on my cup put this

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.320 
on the side of my pot on my cup put this
back<00:04:40.110> in<00:04:40.320> here<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.520> lot<00:04:41.729> of<00:04:41.760> times<00:04:42.150> the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
back in here and a lot of times the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.450 
back in here and a lot of times the
placement<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.199> handle<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.800> like<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.130> do<00:04:44.310> it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
placement of the handle I like to do it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.450 
placement of the handle I like to do it
over<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.360> placement<00:04:45.720> where<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.620> overlap<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
over that placement where I overlap the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.980 
over that placement where I overlap the
cup<00:04:47.669> in<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.940> first<00:04:48.210> place<00:04:48.419> because<00:04:48.690> that's

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
cup in the first place because that's

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.839 
cup in the first place because that's
that<00:04:49.139> double<00:04:49.620> clay<00:04:49.770> usually<00:04:50.340> says<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:50.669> little

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
that double clay usually says a little

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.419 
that double clay usually says a little
bit<00:04:50.970> stronger
