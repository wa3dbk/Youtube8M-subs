00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.830
 if you don't want to use different 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.540
 adhesives 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.300
 expensive equipment then this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.939
 environmentally friendly extension method 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 for you to start is necessary 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.759
 wash the client's hair deeply cleansing 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.589
 shampoo then dry your hair with a hair dryer and 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.730
 if necessary, pull the iron to 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.500
 smooth texture 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.070
 Now you need to separate the whiskey from 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.810
 nape 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.640
 and also to separate marginal zones in order 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.490
 so that the client can do high hair 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.350
 for example high tail 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.350
 the edge line helps to hide stress and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.720
 then a thread is taken of about 30 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.670
 centimeters that need to clasp 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.960
 thin strand of your own hair 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.729
 both ends of the thread to thread in the ring and 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.909
 stretch the strand through the ring to the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.909
 the roots 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.400
 after which we clamp the ring with special ones 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.440
 forceps as close as possible to the hair roots 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.940
 the bottom row consists of about 9 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.600
 11 ringlets the distance between the ringlets 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.130
 is about one centimeter 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.670
 the next row is approximately 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.550
 45 centimeters higher than the first third 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.830
 row just the same to sew on 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.729
 tres need to fold it 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.940
 twice then tres try on a row of ringlets 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.289
 which tres will sew and 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.960
 cut it exactly enough to 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.180
 from first to last was enough 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.580
 special thread for this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.970
 Need to thread the needle with thread in tres 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.580
 and then the bottom under the ring then how 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.280
 can crack up the ring more tightly 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.550
 repeat the same until burst 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.319
 You can start to sew completely with any 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.970
 the edges of the row of rings 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.910
 the rest of the cod will sew 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 to the next row 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.709
 special attention should be paid to the temples 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.400
 as it is very important that in this part 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.040
 press absolutely could not see exactly that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.260
 let you do high hair for 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 it needs to be properly separated marginal 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.830
 line from the temple 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.800
 and the rest is no different from 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.840
 previous rows having finished building 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.420
 need to adapt increments 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.700
 hair to client's hair for example it 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.280
 can be done with the ironing or 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.140
 profiling hair ends to 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.190
 transition from own and extensions 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.000
 no hair was visible 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.530
 and also give the desired shape to the hair 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.600
 hair so extended 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.090
 undergo all sorts of cosmetic 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.560
 curling dyeing procedures 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.019
 curler curlers 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.950
 styling and so on you can just 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.069
 take and give yourself a long thick 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.069
 luxurious curls
