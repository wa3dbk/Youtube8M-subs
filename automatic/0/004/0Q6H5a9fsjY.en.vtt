00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
and it really showed me that at any

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.960 
and it really showed me that at any
moment<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:38.849> can<00:02:39.849> flip<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.690> and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.449 

really<00:02:44.970> game<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.349> mean<00:02:46.650> he<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:47.129> game<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:49.459> so

what I decided to do was I did feel a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.540 
what I decided to do was I did feel a
little<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.340> control<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:54.239> felt<00:02:54.599> like<00:02:54.840> I

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550

wasn't able to get it under control and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.390 
wasn't able to get it under control and
I<00:02:59.670> decided<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.720> was<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
I decided that I was going to do the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.000 
I decided that I was going to do the
five<00:03:02.640> day<00:03:02.940> sleeve<00:03:03.420> test<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:04.620> called<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
five day sleeve test it's called the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.809 
five day sleeve test it's called the
pouch<00:03:05.190> test<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> call<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.200> sleep<00:03:07.620> test<00:03:08.750> and

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
pouch test that I call it sleep test and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.440 
pouch test that I call it sleep test and
just<00:03:11.819> kind<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.209> get<00:03:12.510> my<00:03:13.049> tool<00:03:13.349> back<00:03:14.450> working

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
just kind of get my tool back working

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.220 
just kind of get my tool back working
and<00:03:16.049> get<00:03:16.709> my<00:03:16.860> mind<00:03:17.130> back<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.970> right<00:03:18.230> you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
and get my mind back on the right you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.580 
and get my mind back on the right you
know

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
know

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.520

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
what the five day sleep test is the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.130 
what the five day sleep test is the
first<00:03:25.709> two<00:03:25.920> days<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.489> liquids<00:03:26.989> second<00:03:27.989> day

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
first two days is all liquids second day

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.680 
first two days is all liquids second day
or<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> third<00:03:28.709> day<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.430> soft<00:03:29.730> protein<00:03:30.239> such<00:03:30.540> as

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
or the third day is soft protein such as

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.819 
or the third day is soft protein such as
tuna<00:03:31.170> chicken<00:03:31.709> eggs<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:33.660> kind<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.900> thing<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
tuna chicken eggs that kind of thing the

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.449 
tuna chicken eggs that kind of thing the
fourth<00:03:35.069> day<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:36.290> some<00:03:37.290> form<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.890> proteins<00:03:38.310> that

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
fourth day is some form of proteins that

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.339 
fourth day is some form of proteins that
ground<00:03:38.819> meat<00:03:39.030> ground<00:03:39.480> chicken<00:03:39.750> ground<00:03:39.900> turkey

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
ground meat ground chicken ground turkey

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:48.170 
ground meat ground chicken ground turkey
and<00:03:42.140> then<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.530> fifth<00:03:44.010> day<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:45.290> four<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:47.180> solid

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and then the fifth day is four is solid

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.729 
and then the fifth day is four is solid
protein<00:03:48.569> like<00:03:49.019> chicken<00:03:49.200> breast<00:03:51.739> turkey

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
protein like chicken breast turkey

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.770 
protein like chicken breast turkey
breast<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.910> kind<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.209> stuff<00:03:56.209> today<00:03:57.209> was<00:03:57.569> day

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
breast that kind of stuff today was day

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.170 
breast that kind of stuff today was day
one<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:59.329> I'm<00:04:00.329> tired<00:04:01.190> being<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.400> liquids<00:04:02.819> like

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
one and I'm tired being on liquids like

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
one and I'm tired being on liquids like
that<00:04:03.420> all<00:04:03.600> day<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:05.239> exhausting<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.569> wasn't<00:04:07.019> as

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
that all day is exhausting it wasn't as

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.360 
that all day is exhausting it wasn't as
hard<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.980> got<00:04:08.220> hard<00:04:08.459> at<00:04:08.579> night<00:04:09.380> but<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.980> wasn't

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
hard it got hard at night but it wasn't

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.400 
hard it got hard at night but it wasn't
as<00:04:11.519> hard<00:04:11.819> as<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.480> was<00:04:12.660> before<00:04:12.959> surgery

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
as hard as it was before surgery

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.340 
as hard as it was before surgery
definitely<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.519> mean<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.940> could<00:04:15.180> stay<00:04:15.870> focused

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
definitely I mean I could stay focused

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.860 
definitely I mean I could stay focused
and<00:04:16.530> I'm<00:04:16.650> not<00:04:16.829> hungry<00:04:17.100> all<00:04:17.459> day<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.139> I<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:21.630> don't

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
and I'm not hungry all day and I I don't

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.159 
and I'm not hungry all day and I I don't
like<00:04:22.560> it's<00:04:22.800> it's<00:04:23.070> not<00:04:23.310> as<00:04:23.490> hard<00:04:23.760> as<00:04:24.240> like<00:04:24.870> the

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
like it's it's not as hard as like the

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.080 
like it's it's not as hard as like the
pre-op<00:04:25.919> liquid<00:04:26.700> diet<00:04:26.910> was<00:04:27.180> but<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:29.430> still<00:04:29.849> is

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
pre-op liquid diet was but it still is

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.180 
pre-op liquid diet was but it still is
is<00:04:30.389> hard<00:04:30.870> especially<00:04:31.200> when<00:04:31.770> you're<00:04:32.160> under

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
is hard especially when you're under

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.400 
is hard especially when you're under
stressful<00:04:32.700> situations<00:04:33.060> where<00:04:33.780> you've<00:04:34.020> kind

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
there was ones you can buy in the bottle

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.780 
there was ones you can buy in the bottle
and<00:05:15.630> then<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.690> had<00:05:17.050> some<00:05:17.560> tea<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.330> then<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:20.800> had<00:05:21.190> a

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
jello I just feel like I need to crunch

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.200 
jello I just feel like I need to crunch
on<00:05:30.970> something<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.930> so<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:32.590> had<00:05:32.950> some<00:05:32.980> ice<00:05:33.580> and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
shoot on the ice and then I also chewed

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.470 
shoot on the ice and then I also chewed
on<00:05:37.120> pickle<00:05:38.580> you're<00:05:39.580> not<00:05:39.730> really<00:05:39.970> supposed<00:05:40.360> to

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480
