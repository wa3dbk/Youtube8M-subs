 action unleashed a campaign in melbourne another profession sweetness 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.630
 there is no substance different from other campaigns with tattoo artists 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.040
 other professions 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.680
 at that very moment contours particularly perverse and revolting

 your legs and the Portuguese in school life 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.710
 this time it was with this tactic the songs that tried to return to Cuba 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.170
 are bruises 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 the arrival of cooperation that he consulted in March in an attempt to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.710
 desperate to vote on the lawsuits 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.670
 few words are used 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300
 approved vehicles have not been applied 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.760
 all and will be in the sanitary resignation of the current ministerial tripod 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.200
 and just as the singer also the understanding of all time 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.210
 since as the visa stated a government spokesman 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.630
 any attack against bases of education deemed to be with the government in the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.610
 your set 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.530
 but nothing the educational reform with stone sector I keep government of Socrates 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.020
 if this stone was thrown 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.599
 everything I did for hardware 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.260
 until November - the government can keep the cut on the finger from there until the contrary 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.389
 if I do not see why it will be presented it can only fulfill 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.289
 we are consider one of the prices commented its heavy 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.859
 in the elections due 2009 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.649
 and not only has television counted on capable political opportunism and everything can be 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.349
 possible to create your own 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.279
 the current fight spoke games and took defense 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.009
 among them practiced acts 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.419
 before assuming the 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.889
 is the dimension an important political battle for a democratic citizenship 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.539
 and promises public action against 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.849
 in this way 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.939
 however these the government will print consul clash the courses 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.809
 I'm almost leaving isolated 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.939
 in a fight that is not just his 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.639
 but throughout the Portuguese people 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.199
 in the percent quote 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.370
 is an exception an active attitude of the southern state 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.829
 when all the others 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.840
 I grant the adult indeclinable duty of the Portuguese trade union movement 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.909
 investigation of society's actions 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.889
 in which it supposes the policies of the present government 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.089
 in a form perhaps involuntary 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:23.030
 the courses because the little affair encounters of him and the comparsa face much per day 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.749
 and should have been barred the port this way 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.989
 The problem is that the government of José Sócrates 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.230
 a so-called socialist government 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.940
 completely closed 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.629
 when the great capital is internally and externally 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.330
 democratic legitimacy at the first moment 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.030
 practice 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.820
 with the most voted Portuguese projects 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.670
 a poem compartment event from here I kind of like that three years ago presented to 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.999
 election suffrage 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.789
 let's not have illusions 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.409
 3- partners have been protocolized yarn course 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.359
 are not points each 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.979
 but it is not just the starting point 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.559
 made a lot of people with action 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.430
 and action will always be suspended services the Swiss Alps 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.769
 in these battles 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.159
 tactical concepts of translation and therefore
