00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.720
 let's prepare stewed cheeks 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.120
 with mushrooms the ingredients that 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.000
 we need a kilo of cheeks 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.550
 of veal 500 grams of assorted mushrooms 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.250
 to taste 5 garlic cloves 2 chillies 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.580
 small or hot chili pepper 1 teaspoon 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.050
 paprika 200 milliliters of white wine 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.130
 200 water and a little broth 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.940
 concentrated oil salt pepper and 30 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.670
 grams of breadcrumbs 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.790
 and we're going to start by taking our 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.930
 mushrooms that we already have clean and we're going 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.540
 to cut roughly or in pieces 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.120
 thick better said 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.980
 as you see we have chosen a 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.240
 variety of mushrooms that is quite easy 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.210
 to find 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.460
 it's mushroom mushrooms thistle and 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.580
 mushrooms shiitake but you can put the ones 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 more you like, let's take our pot 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:02.080
 express and we're going to cover the fund with a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.010
 little oil and we are going to chop all the 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.010
 garlic cloves 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 and we are going to throw the dry bulbs 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.390
 and we 're going to start heating everything with 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.160
 very careful that garlic does not burn 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.890
 immediately we will add the cheeks 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.130
 chopped and we're going to take a little 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130
 Salt 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.090
 and a little pepper 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.299
 and we are going to move it so that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.810
 cheeks are doing for all 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.810
 parts 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.900
 once we see that the meat is white 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:49.050
 let's add the paprika 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.050
 and then we incorporate the mushrooms 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.940
 we move everything well 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.950
 and as for the mushrooms begin to 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.950
 moistening we add the wine 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.070
 we put the nose to see if the wine is 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 it has evaporated and we will add the pastillita 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.050
 of broth concentrated in this case or 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.970
 We can also use if we have broth 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.990
 meat directly that we have already 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.260
 made in substitution of water 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.400
 we add the water and close the pot and the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.860
 let's have about 25 medium heat 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.320
 minutes 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.840
 once the ring of the pot has been lowered and 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.510
 we can open it we reheat a 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.690
 moment to add the bread crumbs the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.890
 which is a special grace because it remains with 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.020
 a very nice thickness and ready what 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.240
 We serve with some chips in 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.760
 our case with a little salad 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.770
 and we already have our cheeks with 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.140
 mushrooms that you see is a very dish 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.060
 quick and very simple that also 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.340
 we can do if we do not want to use this 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.190
 type of meat with normal beef for 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.890
 cheat and as you see now that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.500
 it is still cold the body thanks it 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.500
 a lot because it's delicious
