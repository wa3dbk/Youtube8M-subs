00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
the tires and when you're when you're

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
the tires and when you're when you're
checking<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.850> tires<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.510> want<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> Jack<00:00:18.990> the

tubeless tires commonly something can go

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.120 
tubeless tires commonly something can go
in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> tire<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> stays<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> tire

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
in the tire and if it stays in the tire

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.380 
in the tire and if it stays in the tire
it'll<00:00:29.340> stay<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.820> that's<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it'll stay up that's one of the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
it'll stay up that's one of the
advantages<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> tubeless<00:00:31.320> tires<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.489> other

advantages of tubeless tires the other

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.690 
advantages of tubeless tires the other
thing<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.090> air<00:00:33.600> pressure<00:00:33.960> air<00:00:34.890> pressure<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.640> a

in the back or say when this one is in
2x4<00:00:53.039> versus<00:00:53.489> turf<00:00:53.730> mode<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> problem<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> if

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
2x4 versus turf mode the problem is if

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
2x4 versus turf mode the problem is if
the<00:00:56.430> tires<00:00:56.670> aren't<00:00:57.059> exactly<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> rights<00:00:58.109> are

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the tires aren't exactly the rights are

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.760 
the tires aren't exactly the rights are
the<00:00:58.410> same<00:00:58.829> circumference<00:00:59.750> which<00:01:00.750> usually<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the same circumference which usually is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670 
the same circumference which usually is
a<00:01:01.800> function<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.820> tire<00:01:03.059> pressure<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
a function of tire pressure then the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
a function of tire pressure then the
larger<00:01:05.100> tire<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> be

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
larger tire is going to is going to be

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
larger tire is going to is going to be
the<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.590> forceful<00:01:07.920> tire<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the more forceful tire and it's going to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.149 
the more forceful tire and it's going to
try<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> make<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.479> veer<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> left<00:01:10.710> tire<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
try to make it veer say the left tire is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
try to make it veer say the left tire is
slightly<00:01:11.490> larger<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.150> diameter<00:01:12.299> due<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
slightly larger in diameter due to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
slightly larger in diameter due to
having<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.470> pressure<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.430> gonna

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
having more pressure in it it's gonna

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.969 
having more pressure in it it's gonna
make<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.030> pull<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.740> left

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
make it pull to the right if the left

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
make it pull to the right if the left
tire<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.430> larger<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.030> diameter<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.960> gonna

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
tire is larger than diameter it's gonna

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.160 
tire is larger than diameter it's gonna
make<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> pull<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> left<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> then

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
make it pull to the left and then

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.980 
make it pull to the left and then
sometimes<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.400> both<00:01:23.850> tires<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> exact

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
sometimes if both tires have the exact

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
sometimes if both tires have the exact
pressure<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.640> tires<00:01:26.880> they

pressure on these kind of tires they

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
pressure on these kind of tires they
won't<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.570> exactly<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> same<00:01:28.259> diameter<00:01:28.770> and

won't be exactly the same diameter and
in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> past<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:30.780> true<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
in the past the only true way to know is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
in the past the only true way to know is
to<00:01:32.210> run<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> tape<00:01:33.479> measure<00:01:33.750> around<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> outside

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to run a tape measure around the outside

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
to run a tape measure around the outside
if<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.340> person<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.850> not<00:01:35.880> having<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.390> problem<00:01:36.630> with

it they both have nine pounds in and it
drives<00:01:38.850> okay<00:01:39.119> you're<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:39.930> having<00:01:40.140> an

drives okay you're not really having an
issue<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.939> nine<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.540> ordinarily<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
issue then the nine then ordinarily it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
issue then the nine then ordinarily it
wouldn't<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> deal<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.720> having

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
wouldn't be a deal but if you are having

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
wouldn't be a deal but if you are having
problems<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.640> suspect<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
problems like that and you suspect that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
problems like that and you suspect that
that<00:01:48.540> could<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> issue<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> only<00:01:50.159> way

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that could be the issue and the only way

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
that could be the issue and the only way
to<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.579> tell<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> tape<00:01:51.540> measure

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to really tell is to put a tape measure

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
to really tell is to put a tape measure
around<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.229> entire<00:01:52.560> outside<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> wheel

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
around the entire outside of the wheel

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
around the entire outside of the wheel
and<00:01:53.909> compare<00:01:54.450> both<00:01:54.630> wheels<00:01:54.930> together<00:01:55.170> because

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and compare both wheels together because

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.310 
and compare both wheels together because
sometimes<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.579> tires<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:58.140> will

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
sometimes these tires will one will

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.709 
sometimes these tires will one will
swell<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> other

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
swell up a little more than the other

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
swell up a little more than the other
also<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.829> alignment<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
also the other thing with alignment is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.450 
also the other thing with alignment is
checking<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> front<00:02:03.719> end<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> Polaris<00:02:04.500> when

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
checking the front end on a Polaris when

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.280 
checking the front end on a Polaris when
the<00:02:05.549> handlebars<00:02:05.939> are<00:02:06.119> sitting<00:02:06.390> straight<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the handlebars are sitting straight the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.979 
the handlebars are sitting straight the
most<00:02:07.649> phalaris<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.700> front<00:02:09.270> end<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
most phalaris is the front end the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.300 
most phalaris is the front end the
handlebars<00:02:10.709> would<00:02:11.069> be

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
handlebars would be

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.699 
handlebars would be
the<00:02:11.480> front<00:02:12.480> wheels<00:02:12.660> would<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:13.020> towed<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.470> 1/2

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the front wheels would be towed out 1/2

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.830 
the front wheels would be towed out 1/2
an<00:02:13.920> inch<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.310> 1/4<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.120> an<00:02:15.270> inch<00:02:15.360> each<00:02:15.630> way

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

an inch which is 1/4 of an inch each way
from<00:02:16.200> straight<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.510> those<00:02:18.510> are<00:02:18.720> those<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

they<00:02:46.500> shouldn't<00:02:46.769> have<00:02:46.830> problems<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.850> you

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
they shouldn't have problems and you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.370 
they shouldn't have problems and you
should<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.299> able<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> take<00:02:48.900> your<00:02:49.019> hand<00:02:49.200> off<00:02:49.350> the
