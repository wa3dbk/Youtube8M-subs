faculty here at musicians to Institute
in<00:00:21.660> Hollywood<00:00:22.170> California<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.460> lesson

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
in Hollywood California in this lesson

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.370 
in Hollywood California in this lesson
I'm<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.300> talk<00:00:24.450> about<00:00:24.630> reading<00:00:25.200> music

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'm going to talk about reading music

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
I'm going to talk about reading music
and<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.100> system<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.460> I've<00:00:26.640> developed<00:00:26.880> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and a system that I've developed that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
and a system that I've developed that
seems<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.020> help<00:00:28.169> a<00:00:28.529> lot<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.130> students<00:00:29.579> when

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
seems to help a lot of students when

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.269 
seems to help a lot of students when
things<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.079> quite<00:00:31.560> clicking<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
things are not quite clicking and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
things are not quite clicking and
creates<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.970> little<00:00:33.120> bit<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.300> an<00:00:33.450> aha<00:00:33.840> moment

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
creates a little bit of an aha moment

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.630 
creates a little bit of an aha moment
that<00:00:34.770> I've<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.130> happen<00:00:35.520> numerous<00:00:36.239> times<00:00:36.590> so

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
that I've had happen numerous times so

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
that I've had happen numerous times so
this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.239> someone<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.540> has<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> basic

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
this is for someone that has a basic

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
this is for someone that has a basic
understanding<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.980> music<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.489> has<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
understanding of music that has that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.480 
understanding of music that has that
understands<00:00:42.899> time<00:00:43.230> signature<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:44.250> know

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
understands time signature they know

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.520 
understands time signature they know
what<00:00:45.090> quarter<00:00:45.510> notes<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.960> eighth<00:00:46.110> notes<00:00:46.380> I'm

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
what quarter notes and eighth notes I'm

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.960 
what quarter notes and eighth notes I'm
not<00:00:46.650> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.830> go<00:00:46.950> into<00:00:47.100> detail<00:00:47.940> about

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
not going to go into detail about

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.020 
not going to go into detail about
starting<00:00:48.720> from<00:00:48.930> total<00:00:49.290> scratch<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.400> they

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
starting from total scratch but they

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.670 
starting from total scratch but they
have<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> basic<00:00:51.660> understanding<00:00:51.720> of<00:00:52.200> music<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
have a basic understanding of music and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.070 
have a basic understanding of music and
so<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.850> happens<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.330> lot<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> times<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
so what happens a lot of times is that

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.200 
so what happens a lot of times is that
students<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.220> of<00:00:56.340> understand<00:00:56.760> what's<00:00:56.940> going

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
students kind of understand what's going

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.120 
students kind of understand what's going
on<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.900> they<00:00:57.990> don't<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.470> know<00:00:58.860> how<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
on but they don't really know how to

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.550 
on but they don't really know how to
read<00:00:59.400> music<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.630> I<00:01:00.660> mean<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
read music and what I mean by that is

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.130 
read music and what I mean by that is
they<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:03.150> quarter<00:01:03.510> notes<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.900> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they know what quarter notes are and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.200 
they know what quarter notes are and
they<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.009> quarter<00:01:05.430> note<00:01:05.580> rest<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.150> they

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
they know a quarter note rest and they

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
they know a quarter note rest and they
understand<00:01:06.659> eighth<00:01:06.840> notes<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.280> pattern

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
understand eighth notes and on a pattern

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
understand eighth notes and on a pattern
like<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:10.320> could<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.860> right

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
like this they could do all right

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
like this they could do all right
they've<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> ask<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.509> read<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
they've if you ask them to read this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.359 
they've if you ask them to read this
they<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.350> probably<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.829> it<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.220> they

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
they would probably get it because they

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.210 
they would probably get it because they
understand<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.570> each<00:01:15.810> beat<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:17.100> go

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
understand that on each beat as they go

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.000 
understand that on each beat as they go
through<00:01:17.550> they<00:01:18.300> understand<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.470> they

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
through they understand that they

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.680 
through they understand that they
understand<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.750> three<00:01:22.530> four<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.909> rest

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
understand one two three four one rest

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.590 
understand one two three four one rest
three<00:01:25.409> four<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.370> right<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.120> understand

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
three four and right they understand

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.430 
three four and right they understand
that<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.560> where<00:01:28.800> things<00:01:29.130> fall<00:01:29.909> apart<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.690> that

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
that but where things fall apart is that

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.680 
that but where things fall apart is that
they<00:01:31.950> don't<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.460> why<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
they don't really know why it is that

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.420 
they don't really know why it is that
they<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
they just know that that's what it is

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
they just know that that's what it is
but<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.000> know<00:01:36.270> why<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.170> works<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
but they don't know why it works that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.190 
but they don't know why it works that
way<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.340> having<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.729> basic<00:01:39.300> vague

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
way so having a basic vague

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.890 
way so having a basic vague
understanding<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:41.190> how<00:01:41.460> notes<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> rest<00:01:42.630> work

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
understanding of how notes and rest work

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.560 
understanding of how notes and rest work
might<00:01:43.440> work<00:01:43.650> for<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:43.920> last<00:01:44.159> example<00:01:44.729> but

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
might work for that last example but

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
might work for that last example but
where<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:45.960> falls<00:01:46.170> apart<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.010> have

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
where it falls apart is when we have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.280 
where it falls apart is when we have
something<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.049> an

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
something like this when we have an

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.130 
something like this when we have an
eighth<00:01:49.530> note<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:50.040> b1<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.810> quarter

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
eighth note on b1 and we have quarter

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
eighth note on b1 and we have quarter
notes<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.650> ends<00:01:53.190> all<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> sudden

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
notes on the ends all of a sudden

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
notes on the ends all of a sudden
students<00:01:54.930> usually<00:01:55.320> fall<00:01:55.500> apart<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:55.890> they

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
students usually fall apart because they

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
students usually fall apart because they
don't<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.369> understand<00:01:57.030> how<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.390> read<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
don't really understand how to read this

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.160 
don't really understand how to read this
and<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> tell<00:01:59.400> them<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.810> there's<00:02:00.810> two

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and what I tell them is there's two

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.680 
and what I tell them is there's two
things<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.159> any<00:02:02.430> note<00:02:02.940> or<00:02:03.180> rests<00:02:03.510> are<00:02:03.570> going

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
things that any note or rests are going

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.910 
things that any note or rests are going
to<00:02:03.750> tell<00:02:03.930> us<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.260> talking<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to tell us and I'm talking about at the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
to tell us and I'm talking about at the
basic<00:02:05.369> level<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.729> reading<00:02:05.970> rhythms<00:02:06.210> there's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
basic level of reading rhythms there's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.270 
basic level of reading rhythms there's
only<00:02:06.990> two<00:02:07.260> things<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.950> concerned

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
only two things you have to be concerned

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.910 
only two things you have to be concerned
with<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.149> first<00:02:09.390> thing<00:02:09.629> do<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:10.200> make<00:02:10.439> a<00:02:10.619> sound

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
with the first thing do we make a sound

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.850 
with the first thing do we make a sound
or<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.879> make<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> sound<00:02:12.500> making<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.650> sound

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
or we do not make a sound making a sound

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.130 
or we do not make a sound making a sound
would<00:02:14.099> be<00:02:14.129> any<00:02:14.459> note<00:02:14.670> value<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.930> make<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
would be any note value don't make a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.580 
would be any note value don't make a
sound<00:02:16.439> is<00:02:16.739> any<00:02:17.099> rest<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.349> first

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
sound is any rest right that's the first

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.309 
sound is any rest right that's the first
step<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.550> second<00:02:20.970> thing<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.750> note<00:02:22.110> or

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
step the second thing that a note or

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.750 
step the second thing that a note or
arrest<00:02:22.680> tells<00:02:22.950> us

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
arrest tells us

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.199 
arrest tells us
is<00:02:24.230> what's<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.439> value<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:26.069> where<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.909> we<00:02:27.030> look

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
is what's the value or where do we look

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.390 
is what's the value or where do we look
for<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.569> next<00:02:27.840> piece<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.260> information<00:02:28.560> okay

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
for the next piece of information okay

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
for the next piece of information okay
so<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.269> I'm<00:02:30.360> talking<00:02:30.569> about<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.780> value<00:02:31.079> I'm

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so what I'm talking about the value I'm

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.490 
so what I'm talking about the value I'm
talking<00:02:31.409> about<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> note<00:02:31.860> length<00:02:32.329> okay<00:02:33.329> so<00:02:34.170> in

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
talking about the note length okay so in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.460 
talking about the note length okay so in
that<00:02:35.370> example<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:36.269> would<00:02:36.810> talk<00:02:37.079> through<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.409> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
that example I would talk through with a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.649 
that example I would talk through with a
student<00:02:37.860> all<00:02:38.189> we're<00:02:38.519> doing<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.150> getting<00:02:39.390> two

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
student all we're doing is getting two

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.360 
student all we're doing is getting two
pieces<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.049> information<00:02:40.409> from<00:02:40.829> each<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.280> these

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
pieces of information from each of these

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.729 
pieces of information from each of these
things<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.510> always<00:02:42.720> start<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.290> beat<00:02:43.470> one

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
things and we always start on beat one

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.030 
things and we always start on beat one
okay<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:45.690> start<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:45.989> beat<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.379> what<00:02:46.950> is

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
okay so we start on beat one what is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.520 
okay so we start on beat one what is
that<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.909> an<00:02:48.060> eighth<00:02:48.180> note<00:02:48.209> do<00:02:49.079> we<00:02:49.200> make<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that it's an eighth note do we make a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.640 
that it's an eighth note do we make a
sound<00:02:49.799> or<00:02:50.010> not<00:02:50.099> yes<00:02:50.519> we<00:02:50.670> make<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> sound<00:02:51.470> okay<00:02:52.470> an

half a beat to beat four make a sound

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.369 
half a beat to beat four make a sound
now<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.599> worth<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.840> quarter<00:03:37.049> note<00:03:37.260> which

now this is worth a quarter note which

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.990 
now this is worth a quarter note which
pushes<00:03:37.829> us<00:03:37.949> all<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.220> way<00:03:38.280> over<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.579> beat<00:03:38.730> one

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
pushes us all the way over to beat one

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.059 
pushes us all the way over to beat one
and<00:03:39.299> if<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.959> takes<00:03:40.169> us<00:03:40.290> back<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.650> beat<00:03:40.829> one

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
and if it takes us back to beat one

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.879 
and if it takes us back to beat one
evenly<00:03:41.669> at<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.940> end<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:42.870> know<00:03:43.079> then

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
evenly at the end then we know then

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.460 
evenly at the end then we know then
we've<00:03:44.010> been<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:44.579> track<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:45.510> if<00:03:46.169> they

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
we've been on the right track so if they

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.860 
we've been on the right track so if they
can<00:03:46.680> understand<00:03:47.280> that's<00:03:47.849> all<00:03:48.180> reading<00:03:48.660> is

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
can understand that's all reading is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.199 
can understand that's all reading is
reading<00:03:49.590> rhythms<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.639> telling<00:03:50.940> us<00:03:51.000> two

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
reading rhythms that it's telling us two

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.300 
reading rhythms that it's telling us two
pieces<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.569> information<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.799> really

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
pieces of information it really

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.189 
pieces of information it really
simplifies<00:03:53.699> it<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.540> also<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.930> actually

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
simplifies it and it also is actually

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.229 
simplifies it and it also is actually
telling<00:03:55.410> them<00:03:55.590> how<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.190> connect<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.060> these

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
telling them how to connect to these

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.610 
telling them how to connect to these
things<00:03:57.480> together<00:03:57.690> which<00:03:58.049> i<00:03:58.169> think<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.500> the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
things together which i think is the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.420 
things together which i think is the
thing<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.030> so<00:04:00.030> many<00:04:00.060> times<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.569> overlooked

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
thing that so many times is overlooked

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.609 
thing that so many times is overlooked
thanks<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.489> lot
