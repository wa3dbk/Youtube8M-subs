grass that I got half price after Easter
I'm<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.359> go<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.539> with<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> little

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I'm just going to go in with a little

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.099 
I'm just going to go in with a little
hot<00:00:34.289> glue<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.300> put<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.449> in<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:39.660> decorate

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
hot glue and put it in here to decorate

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.899 
hot glue and put it in here to decorate
this<00:00:40.739> part<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.710> an<00:00:44.010> exact

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
this part of it and it's not an exact

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.270 
this part of it and it's not an exact
science<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.929> kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.829> push<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.159> in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
science you just kind of push it in

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
science you just kind of push it in
there<00:00:48.620> just<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.800> add<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.949> little<00:00:50.629> little<00:00:51.629> color

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
there just to add a little little color

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
there just to add a little little color
little<00:00:52.409> texture

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.819 

and<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.420> term<00:01:06.659> away<00:01:06.960> any<00:01:07.289> excess<00:01:12.829> which

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
and you can term away any excess which

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:21.859 
and you can term away any excess which
is<00:01:14.009> what<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:14.729> now

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.910 

kind<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:22.960> like<00:01:23.109> you<00:01:23.289> would<00:01:23.409> trim<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.649> real

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
kind of like you would trim a real

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:43.590 
kind of like you would trim a real
topiary

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.830 

it's<00:01:44.600> just<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.930> fun<00:01:45.320> way<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.530> hide<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.490> foam

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it's just a fun way to hide the foam

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.420 
it's just a fun way to hide the foam
that's<00:01:47.840> underneath<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.799> stick<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.219> wire

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
that's underneath it you stick the wire

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.669 
that's underneath it you stick the wire
in<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:51.409> give<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.920> little<00:01:52.189> bit<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:53.350> color<00:01:54.350> and

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
in and give it a little bit of color and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.419 
in and give it a little bit of color and
dimension<00:01:55.810> now<00:01:56.810> I'm<00:01:56.990> going<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.409> take<00:01:57.679> these

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
dimension now I'm going to take these

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.020 
dimension now I'm going to take these
glittery<00:01:59.030> little<00:01:59.450> pom-poms<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.850> glue<00:02:01.850> them

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
glittery little pom-poms and glue them

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
glittery little pom-poms and glue them
on<00:02:06.189> it's<00:02:07.189> probably<00:02:07.549> best<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:11.590> use<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:14.620> white

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
on it's probably best to use a white

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.400 
on it's probably best to use a white
glue<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.040> part<00:02:21.880> because<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.410> styrofoam

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
glue for this part because the styrofoam

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.309 
glue for this part because the styrofoam
tends<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:25.130> melt<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.269> little<00:02:26.299> bit<00:02:26.690> from<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.959> heat

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
tends to melt a little bit from the heat

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.670 
tends to melt a little bit from the heat
but<00:02:28.160> as<00:02:28.340> long<00:02:28.519> as<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.760> hold<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.120> gently<00:02:29.680> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
but as long as you hold it gently it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.780 
but as long as you hold it gently it
really<00:02:30.890> shouldn't<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> problem<00:02:33.579> I'm<00:02:34.579> going

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
really shouldn't be a problem I'm going

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.460 
really shouldn't be a problem I'm going
to<00:02:34.849> go<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.630> just<00:02:36.319> add<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> bunch<00:02:36.829> of<00:02:36.980> colors

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
to go in and just add a bunch of colors

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.500 
to go in and just add a bunch of colors
that<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.530> like<00:02:41.230> building<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:43.489> ball<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.390> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that I like building up this ball so the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.979 
that I like building up this ball so the
whole<00:02:44.660> thing<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.959> covered<00:02:49.510> they<00:02:50.510> dry<00:02:50.720> pretty

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
whole thing is covered they dry pretty

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.490 
whole thing is covered they dry pretty
quickly<00:02:51.109> so<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:53.630> not<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> problem

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.710 

you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.460> do<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.700> in<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.910> pattern<00:03:00.150> if<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.600> would

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
you can do it in a pattern if you would

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:19.130 
you can do it in a pattern if you would
like<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.800> can<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.190> randomly

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.230 

and<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.069> go<00:03:20.310> ahead<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.610> cover<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
and you just go ahead and cover the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.590 
and you just go ahead and cover the
whole<00:03:21.420> thing<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:23.880> big<00:03:24.090> puffy
