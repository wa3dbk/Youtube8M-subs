that<00:00:30.730> traditionally<00:00:31.689> baltic<00:00:32.230> porters<00:00:32.590> were

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
that traditionally baltic porters were

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.740 
that traditionally baltic porters were
fermented<00:00:33.070> with<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.399> lager<00:00:33.880> yeast<00:00:34.000> strain<00:00:34.540> at

fermented with a lager yeast strain at

fermented with a lager yeast strain at
colder<00:00:35.140> temperatures<00:00:36.359> this<00:00:37.359> was<00:00:37.570> basically

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
colder temperatures this was basically

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.139 
colder temperatures this was basically
due<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.739> original<00:00:39.250> route<00:00:39.430> of<00:00:39.579> travel<00:00:39.850> it

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
due to the original route of travel it

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.209 
due to the original route of travel it
got<00:00:40.269> colder<00:00:40.719> and<00:00:41.500> this<00:00:41.649> is<00:00:41.769> what<00:00:41.890> they<00:00:42.010> needed

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
got colder and this is what they needed

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.810 
got colder and this is what they needed
to<00:00:42.340> do<00:00:42.609> based<00:00:43.510> on<00:00:43.719> that<00:00:44.230> most<00:00:45.010> breweries<00:00:45.550> today

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
to do based on that most breweries today

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.360 
to do based on that most breweries today
who<00:00:46.090> brew<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.390> baltic<00:00:46.960> porter<00:00:46.989> are<00:00:47.500> not<00:00:47.859> using<00:00:48.160> a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
who brew a baltic porter are not using a

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.340 
who brew a baltic porter are not using a
lager<00:00:48.579> yeast<00:00:48.730> there<00:00:49.090> are<00:00:49.179> still<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.719> few<00:00:49.780> that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
lager yeast there are still a few that

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.979 
lager yeast there are still a few that
do<00:00:50.559> jack<00:00:51.010> Savi's<00:00:51.429> come<00:00:51.640> mine<00:00:51.850> obviously<00:00:52.149> but

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
do jack Savi's come mine obviously but

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.270 
do jack Savi's come mine obviously but
most<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.320> them<00:00:53.410> just<00:00:53.620> kind<00:00:53.800> of<00:00:53.859> fake<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:54.219> a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
most of them just kind of fake it a

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.520 
most of them just kind of fake it a
little<00:00:54.399> bit<00:00:54.579> this<00:00:55.149> one<00:00:55.449> actually<00:00:55.660> sounds<00:00:56.410> like

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
little bit this one actually sounds like

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.869 
little bit this one actually sounds like
they<00:00:56.649> are<00:00:56.769> actually<00:00:56.980> using<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.550> lager<00:00:57.760> yeast

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
they are actually using a lager yeast

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.029 
they are actually using a lager yeast
because<00:00:58.300> they<00:00:58.420> talk<00:00:58.660> about<00:00:58.690> cold<00:00:59.589> aging<00:00:59.949> it

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
because they talk about cold aging it

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.529 
because they talk about cold aging it
for<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.249> few<00:01:00.489> months<00:01:00.670> which<00:01:00.999> is<00:01:01.149> what<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.390> do

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
for a few months which is what you do

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.149 
for a few months which is what you do
traditionally<00:01:02.050> with<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.199> lager<00:01:02.499> yeast<00:01:02.679> so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
traditionally with a lager yeast so

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.649 
traditionally with a lager yeast so
looking<00:01:03.760> forward<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.120> one<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:04.420> really
