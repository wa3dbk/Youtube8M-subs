life<00:01:07.470> issues<00:01:07.939> but<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.030> i<00:01:09.119> said<00:01:09.150> i<00:01:09.330> believe

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
life issues but like i said i believe

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130 
life issues but like i said i believe

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this is my sixth jumbo card so i really

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.580 
this is my sixth jumbo card so i really
don't<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> many<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> yeah<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.140> think

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
don't have that many so yeah I think

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
don't have that many so yeah I think
it's<00:01:16.920> pretty<00:01:17.070> cool<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> uh<00:01:17.570> regigigas<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it's pretty cool and uh regigigas is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's pretty cool and uh regigigas is
actually<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:19.560> decent<00:01:19.830> duck<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.490> right

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.990 
actually a pretty decent duck out right
now<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:22.380> hoping<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.520> pack<00:01:23.820> right

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
now so I'm hoping that this pack right
