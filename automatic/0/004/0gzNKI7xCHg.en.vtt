 [Music] 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.559
 today you are going to learn how to do 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.890
 very cool balls with just one 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.090
 bag of balloons and boot very well 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.040
 [Music] 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.250
 [Applause] 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.980
 [Music] 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:30.770
 a bag of balloons more or less like 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:33.200
 100 pieces and scissors stuffed with 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.600
 very little water a balloon more or less 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.610
 as the size shown and is more 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.800
 or less the size of the spheres of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.400
 Crystal for you to compare or give yourself a 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.910
 idea you cut this what was left over and you're 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.250
 you save them to make the layers 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.960
 let's cut out those little tubes of the globe 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.469
 and as I say we are going to keep them 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.630
 the other part is the one used to 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.020
 do the layers have to stretch it very 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.420
 well before and after placing the balloon 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.309
 inside if it came to be like a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.530
 mouth of his tail as well as mine 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.390
 they just cut him until he adapts 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.640
 the globe but that we will only spend 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.940
 initial 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.110
 continues in the process a layer after 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.620
 other 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.700
 always stretching and covering the globe 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.670
 completely 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.610
 Yes and as matter who hurt them the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.829
 Hand cream cures everything 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 we continue the process until it is 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.090
 as of a considerable size I was not 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 are going to perform as the tenth layer 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.100
 until your fingers beg for mercy 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.220
 Until then you leave her if you liked this 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 design you're going to cut out three layers of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.560
 same color 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.540
 and they're going to make the final color of what 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.360
 you will want in my case is this as 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.150
 bluish green then you take three 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.190
 colors of the globe and you will put them as 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.640
 layers so that it is not transparent in 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.390
 other colors below and that is the color 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.210
 predominant 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.780
 since you have put the three layers you are going to 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 take the last one and you will make it light 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.260
 cuts that will work as 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.150
 circulitos at the end so they will see 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.430
 try to have something separated not 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.430
 together that stay the same size 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 and in different areas of the globe 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.000
 [Music] 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.040
 since you have finished this last layer 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.310
 we will place it as we did with 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.270
 the others then we stretch it and the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:45.830
 we place on our main ball 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.830
 with patience, honey, and so on, 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.870
 you adapt it to all a taste the good thing about 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.810
 balloon is that it is very flexible then 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.270
 There you can see how you like and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.790
 ready the first design of 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.250
 ball now we go with the second one that does not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.440
 Staff is my favorite 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.170
 for this design we are going to use the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.490
 parts that we had separated 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.180
 before that these are like little tubes 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.850
 and we started trimming these little ones 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.860
 small pieces that are going to be like licit 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.280
 they are going to put the skin to the ball 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.200
 in the end 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.660
 you're just going to cut out those of the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.060
 sticks or the excess parts of the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.500
 colors that you want for your final ball 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 in this case they are orange yellow and red 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.630
 you're just going to make the lists of your 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.930
 colors then you take these little ones 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.270
 chubs that we cut previously and 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.760
 roll them up until it's like a 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.360
 little league and then you're going to help 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.290
 with your thumb to place it on 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.690
 the ball is just the first 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.030
 hold on because you have so many missing 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.180
 bases 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.980
 so that it looks varied and compensated 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.710
 At the end it is advisable that you go 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.490
 alternating turquoise strong blue colors 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.920
 [Music] 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.020
 if you get it up for some like 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.570
 nothing happens here, you just take it off and 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.850
 you put the joke or the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.760
 science of this is that they have to go very 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.010
 well distributed so that it does not walk 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.950
 happening that way it will be you but 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.400
 We have all these rolls 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.410
 cover should not be seen and in fact you're going to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.440
 finish when they can no longer see each other and see 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.770
 of pure league background 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.140
 continue until all your ball is left 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.210
 full of pure leagues and do not see the 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.940
 background pretty much like that 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.440
 and so and wait until you see how they vote 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.280
 wonderful 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.210
 here is the highest test 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:00.370
 and that's it, that was all 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:03.370
 [Music]
