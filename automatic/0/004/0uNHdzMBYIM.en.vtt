about<00:00:57.030> making<00:00:57.629> forms<00:00:58.079> using<00:00:58.440> these<00:00:58.530> foam

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
about making forms using these foam

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.369 
about making forms using these foam
stamps<00:00:59.460> most<00:01:00.120> people<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> thicker<00:01:00.989> bar<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
stamps most people like a thicker bar of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
stamps most people like a thicker bar of
soap<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.760> two

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
soap so you're going to need to take two

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.870 
soap so you're going to need to take two
identical<00:01:03.290> stamps<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> together<00:01:05.460> will<00:01:05.700> make

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
identical stamps that together will make

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
identical stamps that together will make
one<00:01:06.180> form<00:01:07.220> remove<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> design<00:01:08.670> from<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
one form remove the design from one of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.789 
one form remove the design from one of
the<00:01:09.240> stamps<00:01:09.540> you'll<00:01:10.049> find<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> removes

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the stamps you'll find that it removes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.460 
the stamps you'll find that it removes
fairly<00:01:11.250> easily<00:01:11.570> you'll<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.780> take<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> two

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
fairly easily you'll then take the two

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.520 
fairly easily you'll then take the two
pieces<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.340> hot<00:01:14.640> glue<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.060> together

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
pieces and hot glue them together

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.719 
pieces and hot glue them together
that'll<00:01:16.530> give<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> depth<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> an<00:01:17.430> ideal

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that'll give you the depth of an ideal

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.480 
that'll give you the depth of an ideal
bar<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.119> soap<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> stamp<00:01:19.890> has<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> hang<00:01:20.460> tag

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
bar of soap if the stamp has a hang tag

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.800 
bar of soap if the stamp has a hang tag
now's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> great<00:01:21.330> time<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.689> trim<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:23.810> here

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
now's a great time to trim that off here

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
now's a great time to trim that off here
I've<00:01:24.960> done<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> foot<00:01:25.740> stamp<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> hot

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I've done that with a foot stamp and hot

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
I've done that with a foot stamp and hot
glued<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.150> together<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.810> give<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.200> thick

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
glued them together to give a nice thick

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.130 
glued them together to give a nice thick

for<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.270> rectangle<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.079> like<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.950> because<00:02:03.250> it

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
for the rectangle I like it because it

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.190 
for the rectangle I like it because it
allows<00:02:03.670> for<00:02:04.000> about<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> quarter<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.689> an<00:02:04.869> inch<00:02:04.960> of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
I like this deli container but it's too

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.080 
I like this deli container but it's too
tall<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:10.989> I've<00:02:11.140> cut<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.590> down<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.489> you'll<00:02:12.849> see

into B what matters is that you have

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:56.920 
into B what matters is that you have
equal<00:03:48.370> parts<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.150> B

now I'm going to add Part A to Part B
you<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.210> see<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:12.660> much<00:04:12.870> thinner<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you can see that it's much thinner and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.189 
the two parts don't naturally mix
together<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:28.000> you'll<00:04:28.150> want<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.389> stir<00:04:28.750> until<00:04:28.780> a

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199
