strength some of it's been tough again

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.689 
strength some of it's been tough again
with<00:00:21.169> the<00:00:21.259> training<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:22.039> there's<00:00:22.399> certainly

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
with the training and there's certainly

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:23.950 
with the training and there's certainly
a<00:00:22.759> point<00:00:22.939> in<00:00:23.179> the<00:00:23.239> middle<00:00:23.390> of<00:00:23.479> this<00:00:23.539> week<00:00:23.779> where

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
a point in the middle of this week where

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960 
a point in the middle of this week where
I<00:00:23.989> just<00:00:24.109> sort<00:00:24.439> of<00:00:24.499> crashed<00:00:25.310> out<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.729> was<00:00:25.819> that

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
I just sort of crashed out and was that

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.939 
I just sort of crashed out and was that
certainly<00:00:26.269> exhausted<00:00:26.809> but<00:00:27.019> I<00:00:27.559> kept<00:00:27.859> going

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
certainly exhausted but I kept going

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.109 
certainly exhausted but I kept going
enough<00:00:28.279> sort<00:00:28.519> of<00:00:28.579> picked<00:00:28.729> it<00:00:28.789> back<00:00:28.880> up<00:00:28.939> again

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
enough sort of picked it back up again

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.269 
enough sort of picked it back up again
now<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:29.599> been<00:00:29.720> sort<00:00:29.929> of<00:00:30.099> doing<00:00:31.099> more

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
now it's been sort of doing more

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.950 
now it's been sort of doing more
repetition<00:00:31.819> and<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.180> whole<00:00:32.390> variety<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.780> new

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
repetition and a whole variety of new

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.599 
repetition and a whole variety of new
exercises<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:33.800> it's<00:00:33.920> really<00:00:34.129> sort<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.370> stepped

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:34.609 
exercises so it's really sort of stepped

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.580 
exercises so it's really sort of stepped
up<00:00:34.760> again<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.269> but<00:00:35.929> I'm<00:00:36.019> really<00:00:36.199> exciting<00:00:36.530> to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
up again and but I'm really exciting to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.529 
up again and but I'm really exciting to
see<00:00:36.679> the<00:00:36.800> difference<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.219> I<00:00:37.280> can<00:00:37.309> see<00:00:37.609> how

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
see the difference and I can see how

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.240 
see the difference and I can see how
much<00:00:38.660> more<00:00:38.929> I<00:00:38.960> can<00:00:39.050> do<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> exercises<00:00:40.100> and

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
much more I can do of the exercises and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.979 
much more I can do of the exercises and
how<00:00:40.339> much<00:00:40.489> more<00:00:40.699> weight<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:40.879> can<00:00:41.030> lift<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:41.690> even

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
how much more weight I can lift and even

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:42.790 
how much more weight I can lift and even
in<00:00:42.079> just<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.320> few<00:00:42.440> weeks

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
in just a few weeks

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.750 
in just a few weeks
last<00:00:43.399> week<00:00:43.609> was<00:00:44.210> particularly<00:00:44.719> hard

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
last week was particularly hard

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.150 
last week was particularly hard
motivation<00:00:46.760> levels<00:00:47.089> were<00:00:47.839> fairly<00:00:48.530> fairly<00:00:48.829> low

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
motivation levels were fairly fairly low

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.239 
motivation levels were fairly fairly low
and<00:00:49.429> fully<00:00:50.239> expected<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:51.109> mean<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:51.499> sort<00:00:52.159> of

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
and fully expected I mean it's sort of

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.200 
and fully expected I mean it's sort of
middle<00:00:52.969> group<00:00:53.149> middle<00:00:53.449> middle<00:00:53.629> week<00:00:53.899> and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
middle group middle middle week and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.020 
middle group middle middle week and
really<00:00:56.210> really<00:00:56.359> tough<00:00:56.920> but<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:58.219> pulled<00:00:58.609> out<00:00:58.969> all

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
really really tough but I pulled out all

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.709 
really really tough but I pulled out all
the<00:00:59.269> stops

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
the stops

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.110 
the stops
steps<00:01:00.440> up<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.649> training<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.309> been<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:01.969> let

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120

steps up the training and been to let
Maria<00:01:02.390> give<00:01:02.600> up<00:01:02.719> a<00:01:02.809> tool<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:03.230> definitely<00:01:03.859> try

isn't an issue we've obviously got to a

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.990 
isn't an issue we've obviously got to a
point<00:01:32.960> now<00:01:33.140> where<00:01:33.170> Maria<00:01:34.159> is<00:01:34.340> maintaining<00:01:34.880> her

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
point now where Maria is maintaining her

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.429 
point now where Maria is maintaining her
lean<00:01:35.180> muscle<00:01:35.479> mass<00:01:35.600> which<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:35.810> exactly<00:01:36.259> what

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
lean muscle mass which is exactly what

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.620 
lean muscle mass which is exactly what
we<00:01:36.560> want<00:01:36.740> because<00:01:36.950> more<00:01:37.340> lean<00:01:37.549> muscle<00:01:37.630> equals

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
we want because more lean muscle equals

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.080 
we want because more lean muscle equals
more<00:01:38.810> fat<00:01:39.020> burn<00:01:39.200> okay<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:39.649> that's<00:01:39.979> perfect<00:01:40.490> we

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
more fat burn okay so that's perfect we

eight<00:01:58.670> percent<00:01:58.820> body<00:01:59.270> fat<00:01:59.390> which<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
eight percent body fat which is the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.660 
eight percent body fat which is the
biggest<00:02:01.280> loss<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.840> far<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:04.399> just

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
biggest loss so far and it's just

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.819 
biggest loss so far and it's just
showing<00:02:04.820> there<00:02:05.149> obviously<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.109> training

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829

Maria's<00:02:07.579> efforts<00:02:07.939> are<00:02:08.330> really<00:02:08.750> paying<00:02:08.990> off

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
Maria's efforts are really paying off

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.800 
Maria's efforts are really paying off
when<00:02:09.650> you<00:02:09.740> starting<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.100> see<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.340> result

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
when you starting to see the result

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.860 
when you starting to see the result
it<00:02:10.899> sort<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> makes<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.590> all<00:02:11.680> seem<00:02:11.860> worthwhile

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it sort of makes it all seem worthwhile

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.150 
it sort of makes it all seem worthwhile
for<00:02:13.870> when<00:02:14.050> there's<00:02:14.230> hard<00:02:14.410> days<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.860> stuff<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
for when there's hard days and stuff the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.350 
for when there's hard days and stuff the
fact<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.370> you're<00:02:15.520> actually<00:02:15.640> being<00:02:16.000> up<00:02:16.180> there

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
you can see that progress so quickly and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.430 
you can see that progress so quickly and
makes<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.670> big<00:02:18.790> difference<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:20.050> always<00:02:20.260> hard

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.270 
as well and I think the two hand-in-hand
play<00:03:48.880> part<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:50.260> development<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
play part in the development and the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.490 
play part in the development and the
further<00:03:51.519> push<00:03:51.819> every<00:03:52.389> week<00:03:52.569> I<00:03:52.840> really<00:03:53.290> enjoyed

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
further push every week I really enjoyed

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.199 
further push every week I really enjoyed
the<00:03:53.650> boxing<00:03:53.950> session<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.880> think<00:03:55.120> it's

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
the boxing session and I think it's

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.129 
the boxing session and I think it's
probably<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.510> closest<00:03:55.840> thing<00:03:55.930> we<00:03:56.019> do

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
probably the closest thing we do

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.420 
probably the closest thing we do
directly<00:03:56.530> being<00:03:57.040> able<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.220> get<00:03:57.310> some

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
directly being able to get some

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.580 
directly being able to get some
aggression<00:03:57.700> out<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.150> good<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.200> be<00:03:59.230> able<00:03:59.319> to

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
aggression out so good to be able to

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.559 
aggression out so good to be able to
yeah<00:03:59.859> give<00:04:00.280> Steve<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.519> bit<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.790> punch<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.450> pay
