giant fans right on top the PCB bulling
cool<00:04:01.780> air<00:04:01.989> onto<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.530> keep<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.860> cool<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
cool air onto it to keep it cool and

underneath this - even though you can't
see<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.230> are<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> bunch<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.860> heat<00:04:06.100> pipes<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:07.030> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
see it are a bunch of heat pipes so the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.150 
see it are a bunch of heat pipes so the
heat<00:04:07.660> pipes<00:04:07.959> help<00:04:08.290> dissipate<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.890> heat<00:04:08.920> away

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
heat pipes help dissipate the heat away

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.550 
heat pipes help dissipate the heat away

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
cool air on dissipate the heat even

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.910 
cool air on dissipate the heat even
farther<00:04:13.690> away<00:04:13.959> from<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.440> car

this card requires - eight pin power
connectors<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:22.350> for<00:04:23.350> some<00:04:23.530> reason<00:04:23.919> those<00:04:24.340> are

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
connectors and for some reason those are

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.540 
connectors and for some reason those are
not<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> box<00:04:25.419> here<00:04:26.280> which<00:04:27.280> means<00:04:27.430> that

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
not in the box here which means that

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.969 
not in the box here which means that
some<00:04:27.789> reviewers<00:04:28.090> somewhere<00:04:28.650> receivers<00:04:29.650> up<00:04:29.830> if

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
some reviewers somewhere receivers up if

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.560 
some reviewers somewhere receivers up if
you're<00:04:30.130> watching<00:04:30.280> this<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> tank<00:04:31.360> think

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
you're watching this so the tank think

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.880 
you're watching this so the tank think
back<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.810> sapphire<00:04:31.990> because<00:04:32.380> they're<00:04:32.590> missing

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
back to sapphire because they're missing

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.190 
back to sapphire because they're missing
so<00:04:33.550> we<00:04:34.030> don't<00:04:34.210> have<00:04:34.300> those<00:04:34.510> but<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.840> does<00:04:34.960> take

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
so we don't have those but it does take

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.050 
so we don't have those but it does take
