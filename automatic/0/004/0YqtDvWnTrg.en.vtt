the whole idea for the possibility of a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.660 
the whole idea for the possibility of a
frozen<00:04:04.019> -<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.920> calling<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.760> red<00:04:06.299> winter<00:04:06.690> and

it's<00:04:14.130> all<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.579> mocking<00:04:15.239> but<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:16.350> I

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
it's all just mocking but like I

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.440 
it's all just mocking but like I
mentioned<00:04:16.829> earlier<00:04:17.100> all<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.209> just

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
mentioned earlier all of this is just

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.479 
mentioned earlier all of this is just
systemic<00:04:19.079> programming<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.919> they're<00:04:20.160> using

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
systemic programming and they're using

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.909 
systemic programming and they're using
frozen<00:04:20.790> because<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.540> song<00:04:21.900> let<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.500> go<00:04:22.620> was

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
frozen because that song let it go was

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.700 
frozen because that song let it go was
so<00:04:23.280> popular<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.750> many<00:04:24.930> kids<00:04:25.140> saying<00:04:25.530> it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
so popular and so many kids saying it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.260 
so popular and so many kids saying it
it's<00:04:25.830> sort<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.130> commentary<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:26.820> and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
it's sort of a commentary on that and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.330 
it's sort of a commentary on that and
trying<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.930> make<00:04:28.050> fun<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.650> idea<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.130> like

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
trying to make fun of the idea of like

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.310 
trying to make fun of the idea of like
hey<00:04:29.789> there's<00:04:30.030> probably<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.479> spell<00:04:30.960> on<00:04:30.990> that

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
hey there's probably a spell on that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.020 
hey there's probably a spell on that
song<00:04:31.530> because<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.039> many<00:04:32.130> people<00:04:32.490> listen<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:32.789> it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030

and<00:04:33.180> yeah<00:04:33.570> it's<00:04:33.750> true<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.020> then<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.890> spin<00:04:35.220> it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
and yeah it's true but then to spin it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.310 
and yeah it's true but then to spin it
and<00:04:35.490> say<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.060> mark<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.510> beast'<00:04:36.690> thing<00:04:37.080> is

part<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.039> perhaps<00:04:38.789> part<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.120> this

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
part of it and perhaps part of this

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.900 
part of it and perhaps part of this
whole<00:04:39.390> occult<00:04:39.780> system<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.680> joke<00:04:41.280> about<00:04:41.520> it

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
whole occult system and joke about it

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.520 
whole occult system and joke about it
that's<00:04:42.360> where<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:42.690> conditioning<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.229> taking

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
that's where the conditioning is taking

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.589 
that's where the conditioning is taking
place<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.400> I'm<00:04:44.550> now<00:04:44.700> surprised<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.330> see<00:04:45.450> this

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
place so I'm now surprised to see this

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:46.339 
place so I'm now surprised to see this
kind<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:45.900> stuff

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
kind of stuff

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.900 
kind of stuff

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
but I do want to point it out this is

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.969 
but I do want to point it out this is
the<00:04:48.060> stuff<00:04:48.450> that's<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:48.810> there<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.260> lot<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.800> your

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
the stuff that's out there a lot of your

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.010 
the stuff that's out there a lot of your
teenagers<00:04:50.580> probably<00:04:51.120> kids<00:04:51.330> in<00:04:51.450> their<00:04:51.570> 20s<00:04:51.960> and

teenagers probably kids in their 20s and
stuff<00:04:52.229> like<00:04:52.349> that<00:04:52.530> they<00:04:52.740> probably<00:04:53.190> watch<00:04:53.430> this

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
stuff like that they probably watch this

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.310 
stuff like that they probably watch this
they<00:04:53.849> probably<00:04:54.090> share<00:04:54.570> videos<00:04:54.960> like<00:04:55.140> this

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
they probably share videos like this

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.960 
they probably share videos like this
because<00:04:55.590> they<00:04:55.740> think<00:04:55.800> it's<00:04:56.070> funny<00:04:56.310> but<00:04:56.640> really

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
because they think it's funny but really

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.820 
because they think it's funny but really
what's<00:04:57.150> happening<00:04:57.539> is<00:04:57.720> programming<00:04:58.620> it's

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
what's happening is programming it's

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.440 
what's happening is programming it's
mind<00:04:59.190> control<00:04:59.870> MKULTRA<00:05:00.870> style<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:02.700> enemy

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
mind control MKULTRA style and the enemy

mind control MKULTRA style and the enemy
is<00:05:03.599> really<00:05:03.990> ramping<00:05:04.410> up<00:05:04.530> they're<00:05:04.830> really

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
is really ramping up they're really

trying<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.640> bring<00:05:06.630> this<00:05:07.620> idea<00:05:07.860> into<00:05:08.430> culture

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
trying to bring this idea into culture

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.490 
trying to bring this idea into culture
in<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.090> specific<00:05:09.330> way<00:05:09.840> so<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.349> young

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
in a specific way so that the young

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.830 
in a specific way so that the young
people<00:05:10.890> will<00:05:11.130> accept<00:05:11.669> certain<00:05:12.090> aspects<00:05:12.630> of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
people will accept certain aspects of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.360 
people will accept certain aspects of
technologies<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.830> things<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.099> are<00:05:14.250> coming

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
technologies and things that are coming

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.490 
technologies and things that are coming
out<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.940> even<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.660> occult<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.140> mean<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:16.349> is

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
out and even the occult I mean this is

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500 
out and even the occult I mean this is
portrayed<00:05:16.830> as<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:17.070> cult<00:05:17.430> as<00:05:17.580> evil<00:05:18.030> but<00:05:18.300> at<00:05:18.419> the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
portrayed as a cult as evil but at the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.450 
portrayed as a cult as evil but at the
same<00:05:18.660> time<00:05:18.870> it's<00:05:19.020> not<00:05:19.080> real<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:20.430> know

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
same time it's not real and you know

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.370 
same time it's not real and you know
this<00:05:20.729> whole<00:05:21.030> thing<00:05:21.270> speaks<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:21.960> idea<00:05:22.260> of

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
this whole thing speaks to that idea of

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.740 
this whole thing speaks to that idea of
the<00:05:23.070> greatest<00:05:23.370> trick<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.910> devil<00:05:24.030> ever<00:05:24.360> pulled

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.839 
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.590> convince<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.130> world<00:05:26.250> he<00:05:26.490> didn't

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
was to convince the world he didn't

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:27.529 
was to convince the world he didn't
exist

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
exist

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.390 
exist
and<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:28.320> think<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.680> lot<00:05:28.800> of<00:05:28.919> that<00:05:29.039> is<00:05:29.220> what's

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
and I think a lot of that is what's

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.580 
and I think a lot of that is what's
happening<00:05:29.490> with<00:05:29.910> these<00:05:30.120> cartoons<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.380> little

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
happening with these cartoons and little

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.409 
happening with these cartoons and little
flashy<00:05:31.860> animations<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.550> are<00:05:32.729> mocking

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
flashy animations that are mocking

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.810 
flashy animations that are mocking
they've<00:05:33.870> cult<00:05:34.260> mocking<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.220> idea<00:05:35.490> of<00:05:35.669> the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
they've cult mocking the idea of the

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.040 
they've cult mocking the idea of the
mark<00:05:36.030> of<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.240> beast<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.539> things<00:05:36.750> like<00:05:36.900> that

mark of the beast and things like that

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.260
