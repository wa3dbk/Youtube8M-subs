 little bit of pepper on the inside 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.750
 breast meat and then roll up 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.740
 the flesh on itself wrapping 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.549
 completely 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.549
 the filling 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.600
 when it is well wrapped 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.890
 We insure it with chopsticks and these 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.729
 chopsticks we take them out 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.729
 when cooking 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.369
 place a pan on the fire with a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.369
 poquitico de aceite 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.740
 and over we put the constitution 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.690
 are to study it cure the fate of the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.330
 and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.840
 so they cook with all this 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.840
 event 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.290
 the golden cappa makes us half an hour 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.249
 we turn it around 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.110
 here 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.260
 i 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.830
 to prepare the sauce to the virus we chop 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.860
 in pictures six prisoners maturity a 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.890
 peach and two plums we removed the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.210
 first shells the frozen plums 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.850
 we put a piece of ginger 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.070
 we add the sugar plus or minus one 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.230
 spoonful of brown sugar and a quarter 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.520
 water deposit we place it in the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.870
 fire until they soften 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.630
 consign to low heat 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.920
 soft 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.310
 three quarters of base 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.890
 of orange juice 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.590
 an intel spoon 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 the story and a teaspoon of vinegar 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.950
 White 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.200
 we mix we add 1 tablespoon of 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.200
 honey bee 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.440
 we mix everything very well 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.800
 and we deduce 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.230
 you were mixed where the sauce for 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.930
 leave it blue the idea is that the sarthe 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.910
 it was bittersweet 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.370
 you decide if you want it more sour 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.730
 or harder in this case I'm going to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.150
 leave sweeter 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.620
 and they want blood 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.620
 a little orange flow 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.040
 or demi moore 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:41.280
 for the end of the sauce cooking 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.300
 we open all the fire and let it boil 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.669
 reduce less about 5 minutes 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.180
 and we can go mixing 50 and withdrawing 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.180
 the foam 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.170
 when the sauce has this consistency 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.240
 we put out the fire we remove the ginger 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.690
 and we take them to cool 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.950
 to know if the breast is already cooked 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.330
 we introduce the points of a knife 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.060
 and it comes out easy 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.060
 and when doing saline blood pressure 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.449
 we put out the fire we let it rest so 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.930
 least 10 minutes before cutting when 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.340
 let's go serve 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.340
 we cut the breast 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.300
 yes this easy regime 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.330
 the filling 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.510
 in a follow-up 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.319
 in the dish it is born without 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.879
 accompaniments that we were going to serve and the 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.310
 we can accompany with a sauce 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.050
 bittersweet 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.960
 and we can place at the goal in the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.880
 sauceboat 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.880
 and add a poquitico 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.250
 just a little bit because not everyone 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.250
 he likes to knead 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.930
 then it is better that each person 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.669
 cheerful 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.669
 the amount that s 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.490
 and this list is not breast 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.660
 update our breast stuffed with 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.660
 Ham and cheese
