 you hi to all people it's xenon 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.279
 I hope you are well 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.500
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.730
 small video so exceptional so who 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.079
 will be the second wireless of the week 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.510
 I said I would post qd one by 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.410
 week of the blow there it will be the second 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.820
 I explain to you immediately why 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.460
 not because I have some stuff 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 to tell you is that this low gameplay in 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.550
 big I was playing I 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.570
 was doing the sea I said good I 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.030
 will stop filming because I have 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.020
 not want to recharge my pc and you 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.399
 what am I going to go on battlefield 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.350
 after I did one last part and 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.079
 I find myself here at 103.2 on 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.250
 yemen to the vector so good I had a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.300
 little bit of the blow this gameplay 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.160
 studio mode that's why I want you 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.399
 watch like that I hope he will you 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.870
 will please anyway if not there you 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.210
 go see that on this part I'm 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.909
 on a new account so the no ab to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.320
 genoa beautiful what as subscribers it tells 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.240
 I've created is not worth 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.799
 add an I tell you right now 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.210
 tells that I created that for when I 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.520
 will do special events between 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.219
 quotation marks so you are special lobbys 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.569
 subscribers and that's one anyway I 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.700
 will notify you for sale via twitter 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.819
 by the way, go and follow me 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.959
 on twitter if it's not already done because 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.249
 that this is where I will communicate the 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.719
 more and you can also send 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.079
 messages that I'm trying to answer to a 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.060
 maximum 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.159
 so here's an account that I created for 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.560
 for lobbies for sure this gameplay 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.119
 down I was maybe grade 38 or 39 a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.670
 bullshit like that so no 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.639
 different district ghosts that makes a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.349
 little variety in quotation marks 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.429
 change some of the gameplay dogs and 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.649
 blablabli and blablabla 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.889
 I hope you'll like it anyway 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.119
 despite being in studio mode 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.189
 otherwise what else did I have 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.959
 to tell you yes that's the level of 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.219
 tutorials so I think I'm going 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.789
 start the tutorials from the 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.950
 next week 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.139
 it was very much asked of me especially 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.270
 at the level of displacements so I you 

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.819
 say I think I'll do some tutorials 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.399
 displacement but also by arm so in 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.630
 do it will not hurt and I will take in 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.520
 same time tears I'm on the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.250
 gameplay to introduce you a little 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.560
 tear 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.030
 tell you a little bit the stuff that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 I avoid doing because there is 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.970
 function of guns kind rifles 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.040
 Assault must avoid finding oneself 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.450
 all the time too the melee 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.520
 submachine guns too far you see these 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.540
 cdd must adapt his movements 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.680
 function of his weapon in fact so 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.760
 I try to explain it a bit 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.930
 something else too 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.310
 so not necessarily the challenges but 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.330
 to diversify a little the gameplay that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.800
 you will see on my channel which I 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.580
 thought was starting to do a little bit of 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.650
 nuclear gun 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.750
 so I tried two days during 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.850
 two hours of time at nose a bit of 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.890
 go to the gun and try on you 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.239
 make nuclear like that suddenly I 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.920
 I am strong the first two parts 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.450
 I do not hide from you that I started 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.950
 rage and I thought damn it's from 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.500
 shit this challenge ever I would get there 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 and the parts after I started to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.820
 go up to serial I made a 24 25 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.650
 26 when I did it a lot of times 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.180
 near the neck 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.209
 I think that finally low age can one 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.040
 settle in realize quite often and he 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.500
 I just have to fuck myself a little 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.570
 bah suddenly tell me if you 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.860
 find it cool if you want to see it 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.160
 I try to make you there is no 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.100
 of problem so that's it 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.360
 to help nuclear to the gun 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.250
 one last thing too I hope that 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.380
 you enjoyed the little intro between 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.450
 quotes end not the intro but the clip 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.340
 that I put you before the intro so 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.510
 I try to do that to you not necessarily 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.459
 every video because it's a risk 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.989
 to be hot but to make you pretty 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.370
 often little things like that I 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.709
 go to the beginning of the video I you 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.660
 put a 5.6-second clip with 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.950
 the music behind or an excerpt from 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.780
 pretty stylish movie there it was 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.519
 the quoted extract 300 ha for that one 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.930
 therefore recognizes that in the era of really 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.799
 a great movie that besides I'm going 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.450
 surely see them tonight 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.950
 So you tell me all this in the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.049
 comments if you want to see more than 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.079
 100 kilograms or more of nuclear power at 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.549
 gun is you who choose so 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.200
 besides this weekend I'm going to 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.810
 surely post my biggest gameplay 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.220
 on blackhawks 2 so for now a 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.810
 gameplay in China as elsewhere 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.100
 I was quite surprised to do as much 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.510
 that he with a chic man finally brief 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.890
 age besides I go it's from 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.049
 send it side by side that I hope they 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.360
 will accept at once I hope he 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.310
 you will like this gameplay the key to 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.690
 its end so a small 103.2 for 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.100
 someone who was playing badly those days 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.650
 so it's pretty good 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.120
 on this I wish you all a good 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.419
 end of the day and I tell you to the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.419
 next
