man Sadler wasn't buying me from the
start<00:03:53.900> even<00:03:54.650> though<00:03:54.740> I<00:03:54.770> succeeded<00:03:55.220> in

kidnapping<00:03:55.640> Ashley<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.300> sort<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.750> sensed<00:03:57.080> this

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
kidnapping Ashley I sort of sensed this

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.930

when Sadler didn't completely let me in
the<00:03:59.090> loop<00:03:59.300> under<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> circumstances<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:01.040> had

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
the loop under the circumstances I had

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.620 
the loop under the circumstances I had
no<00:04:01.280> other<00:04:01.430> alternative<00:04:02.000> but<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.150> call<00:04:02.390> for<00:04:02.540> her

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
no other alternative but to call for her

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.600 
no other alternative but to call for her
assistance<00:04:02.920> perhaps<00:04:03.920> she<00:04:04.070> knew<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.340> was<00:04:04.490> the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
assistance perhaps she knew this was the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.040 
assistance perhaps she knew this was the
way<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:04.850> was<00:04:04.880> going<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.300> turn<00:04:05.450> out<00:04:05.600> all<00:04:05.780> along

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
way it was going to turn out all along

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.200 
way it was going to turn out all along
my<00:04:06.800> guess<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.250> her<00:04:07.370> ultimate<00:04:07.790> goal<00:04:07.850> might

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
my guess is that her ultimate goal might

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.210 
my guess is that her ultimate goal might
be<00:04:08.240> different<00:04:08.750> from<00:04:08.840> Wesker's<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.440> mind<00:04:09.680> this

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
be different from Wesker's in mind this

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.650 
be different from Wesker's in mind this
is<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.670> perfect<00:04:10.850> opportunity<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.570> find

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
is just the perfect opportunity to find

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.660 
is just the perfect opportunity to find
