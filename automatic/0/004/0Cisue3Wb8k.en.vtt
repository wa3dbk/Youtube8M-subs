flow we're jelling and ideas are flowing
really<00:00:28.050> things<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.439> happening<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.519> want

it<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> disrupt<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> flow<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it can disrupt the flow of a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
it can disrupt the flow of a
conversation<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> create

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
conversation so we want to create

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
conversation so we want to create
technology<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.239> ultimately<00:00:36.600> enables

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
technology that ultimately enables

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.619 
technology that ultimately enables
groups<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.649> productive<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.280> possible

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
groups to be as productive as possible

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.729 
groups to be as productive as possible
and<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.809> we've<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.110> couple<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.469> different

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

that they plug in first and then and
that<00:03:00.860> means<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.129> somebody<00:03:01.430> else<00:03:01.519> was<00:03:01.640> to

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
that means that somebody else was to

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.460 
that means that somebody else was to

process<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.580> we're<00:03:04.730> really<00:03:04.909> trying<00:03:05.060> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
process so we're really trying to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.330 
process so we're really trying to
simplify<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.690> as<00:03:05.810> much<00:03:05.959> as<00:03:05.989> possible<00:03:06.340> with

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
simplify that as much as possible with

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.010 
simplify that as much as possible with
our<00:03:07.489> experience

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.880 

so<00:03:13.620> from<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:13.920> surface<00:03:14.250> right<00:03:14.430> here

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.010 

with<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.640> couple<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:18.060> taps<00:03:18.240> I<00:03:18.569> can<00:03:18.900> bring

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
with just a couple of taps I can bring

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.050 
with just a couple of taps I can bring
content<00:03:19.470> onto<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.800> screen<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:20.850> here<00:03:21.030> is

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
content onto the screen this one here is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.790 
content onto the screen this one here is
connected<00:03:21.480> wired<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:22.319> can<00:03:22.440> also<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:22.770> it

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
connected wired you can also do it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.559 
connected wired you can also do it
wirelessly<00:03:23.010> using<00:03:23.400> your<00:03:23.760> class<00:03:23.970> technology

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
wirelessly using your class technology

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:25.699 
wirelessly using your class technology
which<00:03:24.930> means<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.200> don't<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.530> fumble

so<00:05:22.509> we<00:05:22.630> built<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:23.020> weighted<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.530> walk<00:05:23.919> away<00:05:24.160> with

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
so we built a weighted to walk away with

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.120 
so we built a weighted to walk away with
confidence<00:05:24.750> with<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> single<00:05:26.139> tap<00:05:26.350> we<00:05:26.740> can<00:05:26.889> end

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
confidence with a single tap we can end
