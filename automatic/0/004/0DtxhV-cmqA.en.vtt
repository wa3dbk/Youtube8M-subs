 I really am such a simple person 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.920
 so simple that from home I'm 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 doing these basic things 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.579
 really because I do not have any kind 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 of preparation or study simply the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.380
 experience of the years and go testing 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 new things and trying to do things 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.160
 new are the ones that I try to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 convey to you for the people 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.570
 who are starting in the kitchen to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 People who like cooking and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.800
 they do not know or have not had time to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 experience little things with my recipes 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.729
 because they have been able to do I'm super 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.130
 happy super excited how I'm not going to

 get excited with so many people that follow me 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.140
 throughout the world if they are 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 because I could name some countries 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.990
 specifically but I'm not going to do it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.179
 because they are so many parts of the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.759
 world that they write to me that they comment to me 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.770
 that they greet me that they put good wave 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.289
 that throw me such good energy both 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.020
 honey , I'm really grateful 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.729
 of god and of the life that he has put in 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.399
 my 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.709
 the desire and the desire to make this channel 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.899
 and have this wonderful contact with 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.079
 all really and with all my heart are the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.500
 I appreciate very much then this video 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.000
 is to thank you for talking about 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.159
 a draw that I'm going to do in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 thanks a very simple raffle 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.479
 but I know that you will like it and also 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.969
 to give you some little tips 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.860
 advice and recommendations on 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.829
 channel and also give them a small 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.810
 good information I 'm going to start 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.619
 recommending and telling them that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.069
 favor 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.170
 the recipes when they do them without doing 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.209
 measures and quantities that I tell you already 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.980
 the approximate times 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.249
 they are always approximate because each 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.409
 oven is a world every kitchen the fires 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:22.560
 they are a world is not the same to cook in 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.299
 a micro that cook gas then one 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.370
 everyone knows the kitchen that has 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.510
 then I all the times that I give 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.060
 the degrees I give in the oven and all 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.040
 are approximate one has to occupy the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.819
 common sense I do not have studies 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.609
 I do not have any proper technique 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.109
 simply the technique that gives you the 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.540
 experience the and trying new things 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.250
 the mistake to try again is 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.169
 go wrong again the third time 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.840
 that you get that technique in which I have 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.819
 me common sense and that's what 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.150
 you also have to occupy if not 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.580
 they are students nor obviously I do not think 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.240
 that a chef is watching my channel 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.370
 but well that's the common sense that 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.290
 we have each one to see our things 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.230
 when I tell them cups they always think 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.330
 I'm talking about measuring cups 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.850
 can go to any store of the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.070
 Chinese to any store where they sell 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.840
 little things jars and things like that or 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.060
 Same supermarkets usually sell 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.310
 these measuring cups that are super 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.410
 super economic are plastic if not 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.020
 they have access to that buy a jug 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.700
 of these plastics or glass that bring 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.800
 the measures that are everywhere 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.100
 those jugs where they usually bring the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.570
 grams and the 2 millimeters then well 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.250
 It will be very easy for you to follow the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.220
 recipes there are also spoons 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.620
 meters where one can go from one 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.890
 half a tablespoon spoonful and he puts the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.840
 grams too and if they have more and more 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.570
 great to have custom recipes 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.200
 You can also buy a dumbbell 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.850
 heavy type scale or a digital scale 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.950
 already then those are like 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.790
 recommendations when I tell them they are 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.860
 rates 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.810
 You know why they ask me and they tell me 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.719
 can be cup of coffee can be cup 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.000
 tea then in a bowl are measuring rates 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:11.340
 as I have shown them in what they 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.590
 I wanted to tell you is that I think I'll start 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.390
 if you let me know in your 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 comments when I buy things 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.859
 implements for the kitchen no matter 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.199
 the value of what I am simply 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.500
 things that I will acquire whatever 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.750
 a blender a blender whatever 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 for the kitchen show them put together the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.099
 complete cooking and show you to 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.990
 you this so that for you 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.490
 also have ideas many times one does not 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.870
 he knows when he is newly above all 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.820
 starting in the kitchen what things 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.180
 buy that beater the beater 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.190
 balloon in a bowl I know many things 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 then go showing a little what 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.750
 I'm acquiring little by little 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.080
 also improve my tools in the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.259
 kitchen good good and now the third 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.310
 step that is what I wanted to tell you 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.410
 that is also what has me the most 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.270
 happy and it's this draw I'm going to make a 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.669
 draw in which I will give a single 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.460
 prize but I do it with all my love 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.669
 with all my heart 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.690
 I'm going to draw is this digital weight this 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.789
 digital kitchen scale since this is the 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.000
 mine but it's going to be one like this one 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:20.449
 equal to this one which is going to be drawn 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.569
 for some lucky ones you have to 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.620
 take this I know that many of you 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.620
 they will have it but many of you 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.300
 neither do men have women 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.509
 girls those guys because they are still many 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:38.449
 men too and well this is so in 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:40.190
 that little bag there has the on off and good 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.280
 They do not know how much you can serve 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.169
 this in the kitchen especially for the 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.139
 part of pastry for quantities 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.720
 that this takes you out of trouble and this 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.030
 it helps you a lot there are many recipes the 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.530
 most of the recipes in that in the 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.840
 pastry the quantities are very 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.419
 exact and you have to stick to the grammages 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.229
 and this is going to take you out but a lot 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.630
 so much trouble then I hope that you 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.980
