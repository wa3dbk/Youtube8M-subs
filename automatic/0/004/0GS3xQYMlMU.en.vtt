00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 with 1 0 the lead for the beautiful on Kiez the 1 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.940
 Songwriter game actually made the big difference in the world's first litter of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.979
 Away 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.889
 clearly further right with another because the ball hits the ball 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.409
 try to play pants as long as possible 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.069
 he sees the cases react significantly more violently and significantly more than 

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:23.230
 caught up 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.319
 Well, that's it, so I see 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.460
 to stop as soon as possible 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.989
 if now the opponent 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.320
 not the chance 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.790
 but they give as we have seen in the quarterfinals results 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.800
 or how would you have mentioned 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.790
 That's exactly why this quarter-final encounter was so exciting 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 so hardly compensated one 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.860
 the guided in two play passes each with the men at 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.660
 the ladies 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.810
 there were already some that wants to have pulled through in two games 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.250
 such as 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.930
 the two finalists will make Zetsche 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 the speech that the quarterfinal match the sheet 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.560
 With two to zero wins both could win in those semifinal matches 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.180
 times 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.010
 we went over the full distance 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.980
 Hadamar 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.850
 it was his last victory 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.440
 clapping and against Nadine Geißler company against Christian Pelli 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.550
 from the UK foreign countries 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.220
 So, the change has really made the change possible 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770
 Schottern sued 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.509
 You can stand with very strong smoke reaction even if doctors are ten species 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.270
 For me, more adjustments may still be necessary 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 Bits to go right 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.920
 even if you may not want to believe that as Larry the winning goal 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.160
 spectacular from Lennep so much new touches but 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.490
 that's really the condition that's great for us 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.860
 the ball has to be in there so Haltiner countries are on it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.079
 Taking into account conditions for this could be a novelty in the winter 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.110
 r 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.189
 she is her too 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.120
 clearly too far left 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.080
 More has to be done both in the countryside and on the head this has to do everything 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 seems to do 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.369
 all the same problems so both times both before the first leg 1 2 on the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.779
 longer height as well now on the short side 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.949
 she has the problem that of her design 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.469
 Right at the gate passes 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.559
 many kick 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.339
 Of course you have to say so now 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.169
 the Latvian throws a new ball so they played on the Center Court 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.619
 possible that one can also make no question at the ball has automatically 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.919
 The length does not testify to cooperation too much and too early empties 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.409
 but then I really have to go much further to the right 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.549
 play and 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.090
 that did not make it at the moment that it is certainly made in games before 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.729
 to have 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.289
 and maybe it has come now 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.249
 the culprits probably just that 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.339
 where she does not feel completely confident and New Year 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.859
 now it's getting slow time is now starting to the middle of the second 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.069
 Finalspiels Orchester Spur Tel 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.919
 Well, Harnik, she does not spring out of the USA, she's doing the game right now 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.269
 also exciting again 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.349
 Oliver 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.959
 there is the open freeman 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.760
 the five-door 6 and 3 and Verviers 80 meters 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.919
 but whatever puzzle Janko has definitely delivered to us so far 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:20.749
 Aalen the beautiful rheumatism Barça again forced to these beautiful spaces too 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:21.679
 play 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:22.929
 barbarians 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.950
 there were already some right 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.729
 Nice Bernard work 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.729
 Fariñas says she has just got the chance to win again 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.900
 throws the catastrophic accusation but over the want we want or 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.319
 do not philosophize Roos 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.819
 Oliver so a draw 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.229
 I hardly say what% and Luber something is in the rushes com, you use something 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.109
 it goes into the rush so we look like this finale 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.000
 has gone on 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.220
 the Christopher Hogbin to maybe a little bit weaker 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.560
 too much reacted in the yard before that was too thin Petersburg directly on the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.809
 Thrown campus and worry so much about Iran 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.809
 but at least safely cleared 8 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.979
 which seems really confused now 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.629
 he ran completely wrong 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.039
 Aachen RPO 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.759
 Matthias loved her 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.759
 there will be some catching up to be criticized 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.759
 8th 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.050
 The Allgäu finally got a mess 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.889
 yes maybe it will come back 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.300
 Although already almost 20 pence behind but that's not much 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.779
 then again bad reputation of Nonnenmacher 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.080
 it will be tight again that year 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.150
 even so what did not get the fight and 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.900
 the Latvians with the double name 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.900
 Kansai 10-residue already significantly shorten 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.270
 if you're getting a lot of power but that's miles away 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.479
 yachts 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.479
 people in Bohlingen are talking units of measure 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.669
 definitely the problem of keeping water 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.669
 plays right 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.949
 there must already be place 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.909
 that everything else than really will be convincing on the Sport Oil 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.550
 this moment 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.039
 but 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.369
 but as long as no one capital out of it with Maria at that time two three 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:51.369
 really good consistent throws in a row 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.879
 everyone could say that 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.819
 he does not secure their chemical opponent their Finnish counterparts 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.869
 to put pressure on her as she plays » 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:06.219
 whenever there is no smoke of a bacterium in the Finns 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.809
 not a wrong code r 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.809
 decent refill and exploit that 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.469
 and so all 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.469
 before the last severe Wieser I think I already eaten 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.119
 Farmer 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:26.169
 Anette has eaten it now 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.330
 ca 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.070
 Pinilla can do a maximum of 100 78 Cermak and Chris is here now with this strike 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.159
 do you still need 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.569
 whole 5 pence with two litters 978 to have 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.619
 so what are you on 6 4-win 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:43.059
 May back 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:44.619
 there is done 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:46.430
 9 scored 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.430
 so that is missing the 18 bands gave to Finland this year 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.439
 b 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.930
 so Birk and accept the congratulations because 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.910
 after winning game one with 237 to 187 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:22.369
 she also has gold in game number two, namely at 8 81 

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:26.119
 to book Dirk 67 will help us 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:29.899
 therefore the last ones 

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:33.919
 Although second place announces an excellent result for the Lohrer 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.860
 Bohlen 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.120
 Hardly anyone is going to be too good at the government before this tournament 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.419
 That's what I wanted him to do, and of course Nadine's third place too 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.319
 Geißler not forget the findings 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:47.319
 very strong idea of ​​her 

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:52.360
 and she says goodbye to Bilstein, as the saying goes 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.870
 below 83 to a hundred 67 the end result 2 back the smooth and distinct 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.669
 Result in the women's final 

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:04.939
 Ankara AFP is the name of the 33 at 33 million tons 

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:09.750
 Winner of the Ladies Christa Thöle Nm from the spring topic a short pause 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.629
 back from there 

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:11.639
 with the comb finale
