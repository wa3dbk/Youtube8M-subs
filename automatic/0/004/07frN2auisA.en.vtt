00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
this is the initial test going to do

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.539 
this is the initial test going to do
much<00:04:20.139> more<00:04:20.320> tests<00:04:20.590> on<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.949> but<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.130> just<00:04:21.220> want<00:04:21.489> to

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
much more tests on it but I just want to

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.990 
much more tests on it but I just want to
turn<00:04:21.729> both<00:04:21.970> machines<00:04:22.240> on<00:04:23.400> scan<00:04:24.400> them<00:04:24.639> ground

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
turn both machines on scan them ground

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.170 
turn both machines on scan them ground
balance<00:04:25.449> them<00:04:25.660> put<00:04:26.020> them<00:04:26.139> on<00:04:26.260> normal<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.180> run

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
balance them put them on normal and run

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.580 
balance them put them on normal and run
it<00:04:28.300> over<00:04:28.419> these<00:04:28.630> three<00:04:28.810> nuggets<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:31.590> pretty

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
it over these three nuggets and pretty

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.370 
it over these three nuggets and pretty
cool<00:04:32.860> conclusion<00:04:33.490> huh<00:04:33.669> I<00:04:33.960> would<00:04:34.960> do<00:04:35.080> some<00:04:35.229> more

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
cool conclusion huh I would do some more

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.010 
cool conclusion huh I would do some more
tests<00:04:35.620> later<00:04:35.860> on
