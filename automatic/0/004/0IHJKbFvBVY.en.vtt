00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
found two pairs on the clearance rack

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and the reason they were on the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.430 
and the reason they were on the
clearance<00:02:32.580> rack<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.940> because<00:02:33.270> they're<00:02:33.630> long

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440
