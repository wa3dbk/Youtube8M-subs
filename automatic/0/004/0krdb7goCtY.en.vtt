00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.510
 nice guys who carbon design by 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.529
 gamers no limits 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.400
 I'm here for this video and introducing you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.290
 nuclear made in three minutes the mode 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.830
 of play and then team station 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.830
 multiple 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.030
 this match was made by ours 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.450
 Tempini 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.300
 I thank him thank you very much for 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.690
 having shot this gameplay that much 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.160
 good and class then the classic 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.500
 used as you can see ha 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 used as a main weapon 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.100
 pleasure and as an accessory has 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.370
 used the silencer charger 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.179
 quick and the specialties you use 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.440
 instead they are inflexible and phantom well 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.770
 flexible 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.570
 you know what it takes to get them 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.040
 rewards kills faster 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.010
 so with less phantom points for not 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 to be seen therefore also this is 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.250
 essential in my opinion to make me create 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 absolutely essential for jackal 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.750
 do nuclear here too if you want to do it 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.850
 with the same weapon then and you must have it 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.670
 for strength jackal and dexterity then 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.370
 also used the c4 obviously 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.380
 and while as a reward he kills and 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.820
 you see that used web counterattack 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.390
 one had advanced 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.850
 so all reward kills that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 go to support the team and 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.820
 support crisis itself of course 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.650
 no kids the game you see here 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.280
 so thank you again tenchini and now 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.870

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.269
