the<00:00:45.539> most<00:00:45.719> part<00:00:45.899> generally<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.770> worth

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the most part generally are worth

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
the most part generally are worth

well so again if the b-line trauma is
probably<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.930> best<00:02:56.109> one<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.409> could<00:02:56.560> pick<00:02:56.680> up

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
probably the best one you could pick up

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.830 
probably the best one you could pick up
the<00:02:57.310> hand<00:02:57.549> cannon<00:02:57.909> is<00:02:58.000> pretty<00:02:58.239> good<00:02:58.419> too<00:02:58.480> it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
the hand cannon is pretty good too it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.110 
the hand cannon is pretty good too it
kind<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.379> it<00:03:00.010> kind<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.250> plays<00:03:00.400> out<00:03:00.669> like<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
kind of it kind of plays out like the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.550 
kind of it kind of plays out like the
Fate<00:03:01.359> bringer<00:03:01.659> would<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.260> double<00:03:02.469> you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
Fate bringer would or the double you

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.050 
Fate bringer would or the double you
know<00:03:02.769> or<00:03:03.069> something<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.549> just<00:03:03.730> kind<00:03:04.030> of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
know or something like that just kind of

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.280 
know or something like that just kind of
an<00:03:04.180> upgraded<00:03:04.629> version<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.139> with<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
an upgraded version of it with the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.890 
an upgraded version of it with the
higher<00:03:05.469> damage<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.000> an<00:03:07.120> incredible<00:03:07.569> 12

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
higher damage but it's an incredible 12

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.330 
higher damage but it's an incredible 12
and<00:03:08.109> again<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.439> Mulligan<00:03:08.799> on<00:03:08.889> it<00:03:09.040> makes<00:03:09.189> it<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
and again the Mulligan on it makes it a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.220 
and again the Mulligan on it makes it a
great<00:03:09.459> thing<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.909> enhanced<00:03:10.450> amo<00:03:10.659> capacity<00:03:11.139> is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
great thing the enhanced amo capacity is

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.050 
great thing the enhanced amo capacity is
good<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.159> first<00:03:12.370> ability<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.790> don't<00:03:12.969> know

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
good to the first ability I don't know

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.339 
good to the first ability I don't know
if<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.209> just<00:03:13.269> broken<00:03:13.540> or<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:13.900> I'm<00:03:13.989> not<00:03:14.139> using

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
if it's just broken or if I'm not using

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.959 
if it's just broken or if I'm not using
it<00:03:14.530> right<00:03:14.680> or<00:03:14.829> what<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.159> but<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.489> almost<00:03:15.669> any

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:15.969 
it right or what it is but in almost any

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.250 
it right or what it is but in almost any
situation<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.419> I<00:03:16.540> use<00:03:16.659> the<00:03:16.780> gun<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.079> didn't

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
situation that I use the gun it didn't

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.960 
situation that I use the gun it didn't
replenish<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.739> mo<00:03:17.979> so<00:03:18.400> when<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.609> return<00:03:18.849> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
replenish the mo so when the return to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.939 
replenish the mo so when the return to
Center<00:03:19.180> actually<00:03:19.510> comes<00:03:19.720> into<00:03:19.959> play<00:03:20.139> or<00:03:20.440> maybe

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
Center actually comes into play or maybe

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.140 
Center actually comes into play or maybe
you<00:03:21.040> guess<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.220> tell<00:03:21.370> me<00:03:21.459> how<00:03:21.579> or<00:03:21.879> what<00:03:22.030> I'm

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
you guess you tell me how or what I'm

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.629 
you guess you tell me how or what I'm

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
doing wrong that should just make that

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.520 
doing wrong that should just make that
gun<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:24.940> much<00:03:25.060> more<00:03:25.269> important<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.139> don't

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
gun that much more important I don't

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.050 
gun that much more important I don't
know<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.919> could<00:03:26.949> just<00:03:27.129> be<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.310> PVE<00:03:27.579> thing<00:03:27.879> I<00:03:27.970> have

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
know it could just be a PVE thing I have

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.179 
know it could just be a PVE thing I have
no<00:03:28.150> clue<00:03:28.299> um<00:03:28.629> be<00:03:29.229> weird<00:03:29.470> because<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:29.949> all<00:03:30.069> by

just<00:04:21.940> worth<00:04:22.210> passing<00:04:22.389> on<00:04:22.659> for<00:04:22.840> PvE<00:04:23.110> because

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
just worth passing on for PvE because

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.540
