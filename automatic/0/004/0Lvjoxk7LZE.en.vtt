how<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.740> design<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.700> new<00:00:06.120> landscape<00:00:07.730> well<00:00:08.730> we<00:00:09.630> go

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
how to design a new landscape well we go

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.169 
how to design a new landscape well we go
crazy<00:00:10.139> with<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
crazy with that because it's like a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.200 
crazy with that because it's like a
blank<00:00:12.630> canvas<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.370> anything<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
blank canvas you can do anything and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.849 
blank canvas you can do anything and
everything<00:00:17.539> some<00:00:18.539> key<00:00:18.779> points<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.439> remember

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
everything some key points to remember

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
everything some key points to remember
as<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.150> approach<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.020> project<00:00:23.660> look<00:00:24.660> at

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
as you approach this project look at

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.439 
as you approach this project look at
your<00:00:24.990> sunlight<00:00:25.289> conditions<00:00:26.160> where<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.090> full

is full shade that's going to determine

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.869 
is full shade that's going to determine
where<00:00:35.460> grass<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.579> what<00:00:38.579> type<00:00:38.850> of

it study it because you will change it
you're<00:01:24.360> gonna<00:01:24.540> change<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> again<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:26.670> draw

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you're gonna change it again but draw

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.410 
you're gonna change it again but draw
something<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.150> an<00:01:30.299> idea

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
something out like this to get an idea

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.609 
something out like this to get an idea
of<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.170> you've<00:01:31.409> got

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
garden hoses to outline areas as you see

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.450 
garden hoses to outline areas as you see
them<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.570> your<00:01:42.990> property<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
them on your property so you get a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
them on your property so you get a
visual<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.590> may<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:49.009> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
visual as to what it may look like the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.569 
visual as to what it may look like the
other<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.140> consider<00:01:52.579> when

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
other thing that you would consider when

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.160 
other thing that you would consider when
you're<00:01:53.729> doing<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:54.180> bed<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:55.170> an<00:01:55.560> area<00:01:56.990> don't<00:01:57.990> make

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you're doing a bed or an area don't make

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.850 
you're doing a bed or an area don't make
it<00:01:58.350> square<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.070> 90<00:01:59.460> degrees<00:02:00.680> put<00:02:01.680> some

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it square and 90 degrees put some

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.370 
it square and 90 degrees put some
character<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:03.380> corners<00:02:04.380> bins<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:06.380> things

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
character into corners bins and things

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.930 
character into corners bins and things
of<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.590> nature<00:02:09.440> grass<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.370> good<00:02:11.520> thing

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
of that nature grass is a good thing

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
of that nature grass is a good thing
because<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
because it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.280 
because it
turns<00:02:13.740> car<00:02:14.070> binocs<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.820> oxide<00:02:15.330> into<00:02:15.870> oxygen

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
turns car binocs the oxide into oxygen

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.860 
turns car binocs the oxide into oxygen
so<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:17.010> something<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.580> breathe<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
so we have something to breathe so you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.130 
so we have something to breathe so you
want<00:02:19.200> some<00:02:19.440> grass<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> don't<00:02:21.840> need<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
want some grass but you don't need to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.590 
want some grass but you don't need to
have<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> lot<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.280> therefore<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
have a lot of it and therefore you can

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.860 
have a lot of it and therefore you can
fill<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.920> some<00:02:26.130> other<00:02:26.310> things<00:02:26.870> thus

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
fill it in with some other things thus

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.800 
fill it in with some other things thus
taking<00:02:28.530> away<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.130> problem<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.970> keeping<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
taking away the problem of keeping the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.110 
taking away the problem of keeping the
grass<00:02:31.050> growing<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.730> South

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
Central Texas maintaining lawns is a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.600 
Central Texas maintaining lawns is a
real<00:02:37.980> challenge<00:02:38.250> at<00:02:38.640> times<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:41.100> basic

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
real challenge at times this basic

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.500 
real challenge at times this basic
design<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:42.890> would<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> walkway<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
design here would put a walkway in to a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.710 
design here would put a walkway in to a
patio<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.850> walkway<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> big<00:02:48.330> turnaround

that's<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.170> good<00:03:34.350> thing<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.830> put<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.670> a
