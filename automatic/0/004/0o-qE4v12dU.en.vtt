00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
device no geography and it'll reset the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
device no geography and it'll reset the
device<00:00:41.940> automatically<00:00:42.660> after<00:00:42.809> 10<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> 12

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
device automatically after 10 to 12

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
device automatically after 10 to 12
seconds<00:00:44.309> ok<00:00:45.270> once<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.350> going

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
seconds ok once you do that it's going

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
seconds ok once you do that it's going
to<00:00:46.590> install<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.370> comm<00:00:47.969> port<00:00:48.180> driver<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> once

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to install a comm port driver so once

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
to install a comm port driver so once
you've<00:00:50.969> completed<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you've completed that and you see in the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
you've completed that and you see in the
list<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> drivers<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.460> says<00:00:53.640> comport<00:00:54.120> then

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
list of drivers that says comport then

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200 
list of drivers that says comport then
we<00:00:54.510> move<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.079> part<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:56.149> ok<00:00:57.149> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we move on to this part right here ok so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
we move on to this part right here ok so
we<00:00:57.570> need<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> find<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.230> comport<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> is

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
we need to find out what comport it is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619 
we need to find out what comport it is
usually<00:00:59.430> it'll<00:00:59.609> save<00:00:59.910> writing<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> driver

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
usually it'll save writing the driver

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.130 
usually it'll save writing the driver
list<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.559> comport<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.219> 13<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.699> whatever

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
list that is comport like 13 or whatever

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.479 
list that is comport like 13 or whatever
ok<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> say<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.250> comp

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
ok so we're going to say that it's comp

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.240 
ok so we're going to say that it's comp
or<00:01:05.760> six<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.770> anyways<00:01:09.560> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> can't<00:01:10.890> find<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
or six but anyways if you can't find it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.719 
or six but anyways if you can't find it
you<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> go<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> devices<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.630> printers

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.510 

ddd<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> hit<00:01:18.180> LG<00:01:18.600> android<00:01:18.840> net<00:01:19.369> hardware<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
ddd and hit LG android net hardware and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.030 
ddd and hit LG android net hardware and
it<00:01:23.520> doesn't<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:25.040> some

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it doesn't have it here because some

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.510 
it doesn't have it here because some
reason<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.850> activated<00:01:27.540> immediately<00:01:28.520> or

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
reason is not activated immediately or

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
reason is not activated immediately or
after<00:01:29.880> after<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> certain<00:01:30.630> point<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.200> spin<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
after after a certain point your spin it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.289 
after after a certain point your spin it
just<00:01:31.860> goes<00:01:32.189> away<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.460> guess<00:01:32.850> you'll<00:01:33.060> you'll

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
just goes away i guess you'll you'll

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.280 
just goes away i guess you'll you'll
you'll<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:33.930> talking<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.170> here

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you'll see what I'm talking about here

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.550 
you'll see what I'm talking about here
in<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> second<00:01:34.939> anyways<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> let's<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.530> ahead

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in a second anyways so let's go ahead

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:47.499 
in a second anyways so let's go ahead
and<00:01:37.770> hold<00:01:38.040> volume<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.930> +<00:01:39.930> power<00:01:41.390> 10<00:01:42.390> seconds

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.120 

now<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:50.369> don't<00:01:50.579> need<00:01:50.640> qpst<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:52.829> doesn't

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
now you don't need qpst but it doesn't

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
now you don't need qpst but it doesn't
hurt<00:01:53.189> anything<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:55.229> notice<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.770> surf

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
hurt anything you notice that the surf

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.880 
hurt anything you notice that the surf
606<00:01:56.790> 25<00:01:57.350> ok<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.100> Montcalm<00:01:59.520> 13<00:02:00.710> now<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.770> gonna

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
606 25 ok so Montcalm 13 now I'm gonna

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.510 
606 25 ok so Montcalm 13 now I'm gonna
open<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.189> cdma<00:02:02.640> workshop

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.800 

and<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.700> got<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.970> do<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.209> really<00:02:08.450> quickly

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and I got to do this really quickly

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.070 
and I got to do this really quickly
because<00:02:09.050> if<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.410> watch<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.950> right<00:02:10.160> here

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
because if you watch this right here

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.930 
because if you watch this right here
it'll<00:02:12.080> eventually<00:02:12.380> disappear<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.760> need<00:02:13.880> to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
it'll eventually disappear so we need to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.600 
it'll eventually disappear so we need to
go<00:02:14.090> into<00:02:14.360> comp<00:02:15.080> 13<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.830> hit<00:02:16.790> connect<00:02:18.610> security

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
go into comp 13 and hit connect security

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.390 
go into comp 13 and hit connect security
up<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.370> gone<00:02:22.640> now<00:02:23.950> okay<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.310> we're

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
up now it's gone now okay so what we're

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.979 
up now it's gone now okay so what we're
