00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
to go through and do this quickly

because<00:00:16.750> there<00:00:17.140> are<00:00:17.290> a<00:00:17.320> couple<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.770> updates

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980

i'm<00:00:18.310> going<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.490> square<00:00:18.849> share<00:00:19.630> my<00:00:19.840> screen<00:00:19.900> here

this<00:00:25.779> will<00:00:25.960> be<00:00:26.079> good<00:00:26.200> because<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:26.680> has<00:00:26.829> been<00:00:27.009> a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
this will be good because it has been a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
point for in the Philippines so what I

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.590 
point for in the Philippines so what I
would<00:01:37.450> like<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.810> ask<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:39.000> website<00:01:40.000> members<00:01:40.390> if

would like to ask is website members if

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.200 
would like to ask is website members if
you<00:01:40.750> feel<00:01:41.110> like<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.530> are<00:01:41.560> really<00:01:42.010> up<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:42.880> on

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
you feel like you are really up to it on

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.450 
you feel like you are really up to it on
not<00:01:43.420> just<00:01:43.720> what<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.470> have<00:01:44.710> been<00:01:44.890> using<00:01:44.950> for

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
not just what we have been using for

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.510 
not just what we have been using for
earthquake<00:01:45.970> factors<00:01:46.480> but<00:01:46.750> also<00:01:47.110> what<00:01:47.830> dr.<00:01:48.280> Koo

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520
