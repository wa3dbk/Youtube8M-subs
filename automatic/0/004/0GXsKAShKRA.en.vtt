you're introducing a new version of the
proline<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> fusion<00:00:20.910> what's<00:00:21.300> new<00:00:21.539> about

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
proline it's the fusion what's new about

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
proline it's the fusion what's new about
proline<00:00:22.199> fusion<00:00:22.619> well<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> proline<00:00:24.060> fusion

to<00:00:36.950> give<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> pilot<00:00:38.610> quick<00:00:38.790> access<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to give the pilot quick access to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.680 
to give the pilot quick access to
information<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.980> lastly<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.969> the

provides<00:00:44.570> let's<00:00:45.570> talk<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> little<00:00:45.960> bit<00:00:46.079> about

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
provides let's talk a little bit about

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
provides let's talk a little bit about
that<00:00:46.350> situational<00:00:47.010> awareness<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.670> what

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that situational awareness because what

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
that situational awareness because what
that<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.149> giving<00:00:48.480> pilots<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.289> head-up

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that is giving pilots is a head-up

very first-ever synthetic vision on a
head-up<00:00:59.190> display<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.730> what's<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.809> key

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
head-up display so what's really key

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
head-up display so what's really key
about<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> allows<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.250> pilot<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
about that is it allows the pilot to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
about that is it allows the pilot to
keep<00:01:02.820> his<00:01:03.000> eyes<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> window<00:01:03.960> while<00:01:04.680> he's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
keep his eyes out the window while he's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.429 
keep his eyes out the window while he's
viewing<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> synthetic<00:01:05.939> vision<00:01:06.090> world<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
viewing the synthetic vision world we

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.840 
viewing the synthetic vision world we
looked<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.860> video<00:01:08.010> during<00:01:08.729> your

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
looked at a video during your

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
looked at a video during your
presentation<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.810> saw<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.229> very

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
presentation and I saw some very

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
presentation and I saw some very
interesting<00:01:11.119> representations<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
interesting representations of that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.350 
interesting representations of that
synthetic<00:01:13.229> vision<00:01:13.670> what<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.790> different<00:01:15.299> about

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
synthetic vision what is different about

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.160 
synthetic vision what is different about
it<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:15.930> does<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.729> Rockwell<00:01:17.729> Collins

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it and how does the Rockwell Collins

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.960 
it and how does the Rockwell Collins
synthetic<00:01:19.170> vision<00:01:19.320> compare<00:01:20.009> what's<00:01:20.700> unique

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
synthetic vision compare what's unique

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330 
synthetic vision compare what's unique
about<00:01:21.060> our<00:01:21.330> synthetic<00:01:21.840> vision<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> couple

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
about our synthetic vision is a couple

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
about our synthetic vision is a couple
things<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.420> high<00:01:24.600> resolution

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
things one is it's very high resolution

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
things one is it's very high resolution
because<00:01:25.290> we're<00:01:25.500> using<00:01:25.650> three<00:01:25.890> arcsecond

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
because we're using three arcsecond

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
because we're using three arcsecond
databases<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> highest

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
databases which is the highest

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.010 
databases which is the highest
resolution<00:01:28.259> database<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.520> industry<00:01:30.210> but

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
resolution database in the industry but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.859 
resolution database in the industry but
number<00:01:31.259> two<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.950> patented<00:01:32.869> airport

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
number two we have a patented airport

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
number two we have a patented airport
identifier<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.430> dome<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.909> shows

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
identifier it's a little dome that shows

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
identifier it's a little dome that shows
up<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.420> top<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> airport<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.320> their<00:01:37.500> pilots

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
up on top of the airport as their pilots

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
up on top of the airport as their pilots
are<00:01:37.920> approaching<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> airport<00:01:38.520> gives<00:01:39.210> very

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
are approaching the airport gives very

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
are approaching the airport gives very
rapid<00:01:39.990> realization<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> pilots

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
rapid realization of where the pilots

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
rapid realization of where the pilots
flying<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.930> dome<00:01:43.140> slowly<00:01:43.710> fades

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
flying to and that dome slowly fades

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710 
flying to and that dome slowly fades
away<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:44.820> approaches<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.210> airport
