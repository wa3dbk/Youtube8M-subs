00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.660 
way deep inside Sasha's uh I think he
fits<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.319> game<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:50.830> well<00:03:51.040> because<00:03:51.280> he

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
fits in with the game so well because he

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.940 
fits in with the game so well because he
really<00:03:51.940> is<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.060> product<00:03:52.420> of<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.860> environment

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
really is a product of the environment

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.620 
really is a product of the environment
that<00:03:54.700> he's<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.360> this<00:03:56.080> is<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.230> guy<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:57.540> like<00:03:58.540> I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
that he's in this is a guy that like I

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.449 
that he's in this is a guy that like I
say<00:03:58.810> some<00:03:59.110> place<00:03:59.319> deep<00:03:59.530> inside<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.010> think<00:04:00.340> he

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
say some place deep inside I think he

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.780 
say some place deep inside I think he
there's<00:04:01.030> something<00:04:01.269> good<00:04:01.569> about<00:04:01.630> him<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:03.310> he

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there's something good about him but he

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.300 
there's something good about him but he
knows<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.660> if<00:04:04.810> he's<00:04:04.959> gonna<00:04:05.140> survive<00:04:05.590> it's

just what his role is but when we
included<00:04:51.460> Tosh<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.910> storyline<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:53.680> trick

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.130 
included Tosh in the storyline the trick
is<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.310> lot<00:04:54.430> of<00:04:54.490> ways<00:04:54.700> Tosh<00:04:55.450> counters<00:04:55.930> a

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
is in a lot of ways Tosh counters a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.690 
is in a lot of ways Tosh counters a
character<00:04:56.560> named<00:04:56.680> Matt<00:04:56.830> Horner<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.580> the
