is very important very vital and what I
believe<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.580> book<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:29.909> best<00:05:30.060> represents<00:05:30.509> it

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
believe the book that best represents it

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.950 
believe the book that best represents it
is<00:05:30.720> Frankenstein<00:05:34.070> mostly<00:05:35.070> because<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.789> lot<00:05:36.630> of

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
is Frankenstein mostly because a lot of

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.990 
is Frankenstein mostly because a lot of
the<00:05:37.050> conversation<00:05:37.860> revolves<00:05:38.520> around<00:05:38.639> rather

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
the conversation revolves around rather

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.860 
the conversation revolves around rather
Frankenstein<00:05:39.599> is<00:05:40.169> risen<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.740> monster<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.870> is

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
Frankenstein is risen a monster and is

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.499 
Frankenstein is risen a monster and is
he<00:05:43.139> human<00:05:43.349> and<00:05:43.770> if<00:05:44.400> he<00:05:44.580> is<00:05:44.639> human<00:05:44.969> what<00:05:45.300> makes

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
he human and if he is human what makes

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.570 
he human and if he is human what makes
him<00:05:45.659> human<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:46.710> believe<00:05:46.979> that<00:05:47.009> the<00:05:47.400> monster

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
him human and I believe that the monster

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.800 
him human and I believe that the monster
was<00:05:48.169> human<00:05:49.169> because<00:05:49.800> of<00:05:49.949> my<00:05:50.039> eyes<00:05:50.219> he<00:05:50.430> had

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
was human because of my eyes he had

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.430 
was human because of my eyes he had
emotions<00:05:51.810> he<00:05:52.530> had<00:05:52.699> faint<00:05:53.699> of<00:05:54.000> fear<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.080> pain

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
emotions he had faint of fear and pain

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.600 
emotions he had faint of fear and pain
and<00:05:56.780> he<00:05:57.780> lost<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.440> lot<00:05:58.469> when<00:05:59.159> Frankenstein<00:06:00.120> left

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
and he lost a lot when Frankenstein left

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.610 
and he lost a lot when Frankenstein left
and<00:06:00.819> I<00:06:01.449> believe<00:06:01.509> Frank<00:06:01.990> aside<00:06:02.259> was<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.500> one

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
and I believe Frank aside was the one

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.290 
and I believe Frank aside was the one
that<00:06:02.740> was<00:06:02.800> inhumane<00:06:03.310> because<00:06:03.669> he<00:06:03.789> simply<00:06:03.939> made

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
that was inhumane because he simply made

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.350 
that was inhumane because he simply made
him<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:04.659> like<00:06:04.840> left<00:06:05.169> him<00:06:05.349> and<00:06:05.969> he<00:06:06.969> didn't<00:06:07.270> even

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
him and like left him and he didn't even

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.899 
him and like left him and he didn't even
try<00:06:07.719> to<00:06:07.930> take<00:06:08.409> care<00:06:08.620> of<00:06:08.680> him<00:06:08.889> and<00:06:09.099> that's<00:06:09.550> why

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
try to take care of him and that's why

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.179 
try to take care of him and that's why
the<00:06:10.330> monster<00:06:10.479> became<00:06:10.960> Indian<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.830> monster

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
the monster became Indian a monster

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.920 
the monster became Indian a monster
because<00:06:12.310> Frankenstein<00:06:13.090> didn't<00:06:13.810> take

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
because Frankenstein didn't take

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:29.770 
because Frankenstein didn't take
responsibility<00:06:14.759> so<00:06:15.900> yes
