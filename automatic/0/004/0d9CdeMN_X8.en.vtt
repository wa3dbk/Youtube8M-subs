00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.699
 and they manage to make an object for the first time 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.410
 completely invisible layers of 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.949
 invisibility existing so far 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.860
 they reflected the incident light scientists 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.810
 of duke university in usa achieve 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 for the first time the total invisibility 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.250
 of an object to the microwaves what 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.020
 they got thanks to a device in 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.760
 diamond shape and a new goal 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.340
 material that could revolutionize the 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.069
 transmission of light and waves and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.229
 in 2006 several researchers of that 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.659
 university presented a device 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.460
 of invisibility however the 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.100
 results of that experiment do not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.229
 they were the expected ones thanks to a design 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.030
 improved scientists seem to have 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.179
 invented the invisibility cloak 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.280
 perfect so researchers managed 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.559
 create a metamaterial capable of guiding the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.359
 electromagnetic waves around a 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.370
 object so that they emerge in the 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.400
 another side as if they had happened to 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.810
 through an empty volume of space 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.390
 camouflaging or making invisible said 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.190
 element in the experiment they achieved 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.540
 make the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.900
 microwave an object 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.690
 75 centimeters wide and 1 high 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.790
 also this time they got that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.650
 there was no kind of reflection a 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.080
 failure that did occur in attempts 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.780
 previous the responsible researcher 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.060
 of work nate and land and noted that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.950
 in the tests conducted in 2006 the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.810
 problem was the loss of waves due 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.790
 to the reflections in the limits of 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.190
 device and instead of hiding a 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.960
 object completely the phenomenon was 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.790
 similar to what happens when you look at 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.530
 through a glass even though it 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.240
 can see through it the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.550
 viewer is aware that the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.830
 glass exists due to reflected light 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.690
 on its surface in the recent 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.060
 experiment published in the magazine 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.190
 'nature materials' has been reduced 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 appearance of said reflexes through the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.729
 use of the new metamaterial that adds 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.000
 copper strips to the layer created makes 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.040
 six years the new layer divides the light into 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.110
 two waves traveling around a 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.180
 object in the center and emerge as a 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.820
 only wave with a minimal loss for the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.500
 reflection points to the cndh and the team 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.080
 has planned to apply the knowledge 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.070
 obtained in layers of invisibility of 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.070
 three dimensions
