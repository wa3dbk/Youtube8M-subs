00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
right here I'm just going to do the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:30.570 
right here I'm just going to do the
center<00:01:15.450> areas<00:01:16.190> very<00:01:17.190> lightly

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.810

once I have this to this point I'm going
to<00:01:33.910> raise<00:01:34.630> my<00:01:34.840> air<00:01:35.080> pressure<00:01:35.440> up<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.720> about

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
to raise my air pressure up to about

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.030 
to raise my air pressure up to about
maybe<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.580> out<00:01:39.730> 18<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:41.230> pull<00:01:41.560> an<00:01:41.650> airbrush

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
maybe you out 18 and pull an airbrush

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.220 
maybe you out 18 and pull an airbrush
fact<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.520> little<00:01:42.820> bit<00:01:42.970> further<00:01:43.180> I'm<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.110> to

fact a little bit further I'm going to
open<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.920> little<00:01:45.100> bit<00:01:45.370> i'm<00:01:45.580> just<00:01:46.000> going

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
open it up a little bit i'm just going

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.740 
open it up a little bit i'm just going
to<00:01:46.180> spray<00:01:47.140> over<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.770> entire<00:01:48.100> Park<00:01:48.750> blending

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
in all the areas this was the top part

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.590 
in all the areas this was the top part
and<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.390> quickly<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:56.730> that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.320 

I'm<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> blend<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.250> these<00:02:02.430> areas<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:03.030> so

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
I'm going to blend all these areas in so

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.890 
I'm going to blend all these areas in so
that<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.189> nice<00:02:05.189> subtle<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:06.270> shading

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
that I have a nice subtle little shading

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.400 
that I have a nice subtle little shading
on<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.950> piece

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.720 

it's<00:02:14.410> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.650> turn<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.040> around<00:02:15.250> making

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
it's going to turn this around making

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.330 
it's going to turn this around making
sure<00:02:16.319> everything<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.349> uniform<00:02:17.530> around<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
sure everything is uniform around the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.380 
sure everything is uniform around the
park

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.140 

and<00:02:26.960> then<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.200> have<00:02:27.230> it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
and then we have it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.650 
and then we have it
you<00:02:29.720> see<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.079> edges<00:02:30.409> are<00:02:30.530> shaded

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you see the edges are shaded

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.080 
you see the edges are shaded
and<00:02:33.500> areas<00:02:33.920> around<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.280> lines<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.700> our

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and areas around the lines of our

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.350 
and areas around the lines of our
slightly<00:02:35.570> shaded

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.380 

I've<00:02:38.840> got<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:39.830> bit<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.490> blue<00:02:40.700> tint<00:02:41.000> and
