00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
probably around twenty-five to thirty

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
probably around twenty-five to thirty
percent<00:01:14.850> better<00:01:15.060> than<00:01:15.330> any<00:01:15.570> other<00:01:15.930> run<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
percent better than any other run that I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
percent better than any other run that I

I<00:01:28.799> start<00:01:28.890> saying<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.340> few<00:01:29.369> words<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.000> raise<00:01:30.210> up

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
I start saying a few words and raise up

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
I start saying a few words and raise up
a<00:01:30.540> bridge<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> which<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.890> cross

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
a bridge for you which you can cross

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
a bridge for you which you can cross
over<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> festering<00:01:33.090> woods<00:01:33.360> now

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
over into the festering woods now

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.969 
over into the festering woods now
festering<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> probably<00:01:34.740> been<00:01:34.860> here

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
festering would you probably been here

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
festering would you probably been here
before<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.490> you've<00:01:35.850> done<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.060> question

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
before and you've done this question

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
before and you've done this question
million<00:01:36.630> times<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.259> there's<00:01:37.799> two<00:01:38.070> parts<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
million times but there's two parts to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
million times but there's two parts to
it<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.090> Warriors<00:01:39.540> rest<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> decrypted

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it is the Warriors rest and decrypted

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
it is the Warriors rest and decrypted
the<00:01:40.799> ancients<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.299> said<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.540> did

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the ancients now like I said I did

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
the ancients now like I said I did
extensive<00:01:43.079> testing<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.710> tested<00:01:44.130> both<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.460> these

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
extensive testing I tested both of these

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
extensive testing I tested both of these
areas<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.299> same<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.810> cryptid<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> interest

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
areas the same and cryptid the interest

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.889 
areas the same and cryptid the interest
actually<00:01:47.399> proved<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.780> like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
actually proved to be I think like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.330 
actually proved to be I think like
fifteen<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.439> twenty<00:01:49.649> percent<00:01:49.890> better<00:01:50.070> than

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
fifteen to twenty percent better than

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280 
fifteen to twenty percent better than
the<00:01:50.490> Warriors<00:01:50.820> wrist<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.360> definitely<00:01:52.049> give<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the Warriors wrist so definitely give it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
the Warriors wrist so definitely give it
a<00:01:52.350> try<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.070> awesome<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
a try it is really awesome now how it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060 
a try it is really awesome now how it
works<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> once<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.590> into<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> crypt

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
works out is once you get into the crypt

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.380 
works out is once you get into the crypt
of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> Ancients<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.880> actually<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
of the Ancients you actually get a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.690 
of the Ancients you actually get a
checkpoint<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.530> every<00:01:58.950> time<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.310> leave<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
checkpoint so every time you leave the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
checkpoint so every time you leave the
game<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.600> finish<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.200> quest<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
game if you don't finish this quest and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
game if you don't finish this quest and
rejoin<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.850> resumed<00:02:03.299> game<00:02:03.570> you're<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
rejoin it resumed game you're going to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.389 
rejoin it resumed game you're going to
be<00:02:04.290> right<00:02:04.500> back<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> waypoint

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
be right back here you have a waypoint

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.370 
be right back here you have a waypoint
to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> crypt<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> Ancients<00:02:06.630> every<00:02:07.110> time

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to the crypt of the Ancients every time

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.139 
to the crypt of the Ancients every time
which<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.250> nice<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.489> pretty<00:02:08.849> much<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
which is really nice and pretty much the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.839 
which is really nice and pretty much the
key<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> making<00:02:09.750> these<00:02:09.959> runs<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.470> quick<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.950> i

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
key to making these runs so quick as i

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.050 
key to making these runs so quick as i
get<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.390> minute

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
get about a minute

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970 
get about a minute
run<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.349> take<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> little<00:02:14.680> bit<00:02:14.800> longer

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
run so if you take a little bit longer

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.040 
run so if you take a little bit longer
try<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.400> lower<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.030> MP<00:02:16.300> level<00:02:16.630> maybe<00:02:16.810> try<00:02:16.989> to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
try to lower your MP level maybe try to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.270 
try to lower your MP level maybe try to
get<00:02:17.140> little<00:02:17.290> bit<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.470> damage<00:02:17.860> maybe<00:02:18.040> run

get little bit more damage maybe run

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.070 
get little bit more damage maybe run
some<00:02:18.459> with<00:02:18.940> some<00:02:19.060> friends<00:02:19.450> or<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.989> know

some with some friends or you know
whatever<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> case<00:02:20.560> may<00:02:20.739> be<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:21.010> try<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.280> get

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
whatever the case may be to try to get

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.130 
whatever the case may be to try to get
it<00:02:21.550> at<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.849> one<00:02:22.060> minute<00:02:22.330> marker<00:02:22.630> under<00:02:22.989> as

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
it at that one minute marker under as

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.900 
it at that one minute marker under as
that<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> most<00:02:23.980> effective<00:02:24.250> way<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.610> found

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
that is the most effective way I found

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.970 
that is the most effective way I found
this<00:02:25.030> run<00:02:25.209> works<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.810> how<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> actually<00:02:26.800> works

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
this run works and how it actually works

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.040 
this run works and how it actually works
is<00:02:27.340> as<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.730> go<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.360> literally<00:02:28.720> pick

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
is as you go in and you literally pick

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.800 
is as you go in and you literally pick
up<00:02:29.200> everything<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.940> pick<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.390> tones<00:02:31.630> of

part<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.730> set<00:02:52.269> currency<00:02:52.810> that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
part it is a really set currency that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.180 
part it is a really set currency that
you're<00:02:53.019> going<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.260> getting<00:02:53.530> from<00:02:53.680> these<00:02:53.860> so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
you're going to be getting from these so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.340 
you're going to be getting from these so
you<00:02:54.400> know<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.030> really<00:02:55.299> worth<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.959> pick

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
you know it is really worth it to pick

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.780 
you know it is really worth it to pick
up<00:02:56.500> these<00:02:56.620> items<00:02:56.830> especially<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.430> these<00:02:57.549> runs

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
up these items especially on these runs

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.229 
up these items especially on these runs
here<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:59.349> did<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.160> runs<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.730> took<00:03:00.880> me<00:03:01.030> about

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
here as I did for runs it took me about

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.059 
here as I did for runs it took me about
four<00:03:01.630> minutes<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.080> did<00:03:02.230> die<00:03:02.410> at<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> last<00:03:02.890> run

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
four minutes I did die at the last run

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.710 
four minutes I did die at the last run
so<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.060> know<00:03:04.090> took<00:03:04.330> out<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.599> that

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
so I kind of you know took out of that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.900 
so I kind of you know took out of that
but<00:03:05.170> my<00:03:05.349> average<00:03:05.620> runs<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.370> was<00:03:06.519> under<00:03:06.880> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
but my average runs it was under a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.000 
but my average runs it was under a
minute<00:03:07.180> per<00:03:07.420> run<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:07.930> for<00:03:08.170> four<00:03:08.349> minutes<00:03:08.590> it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
minute per run so for four minutes it

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.199 
minute per run so for four minutes it
would<00:03:09.370> be<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:09.790> know<00:03:09.910> about<00:03:10.150> 15<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.590> know<00:03:12.209> runs

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
would be you know about 15 you know runs

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.849 
would be you know about 15 you know runs
of<00:03:13.569> these<00:03:14.319> sets<00:03:14.739> per<00:03:15.370> hour<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.239> was<00:03:16.360> getting

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
of these sets per hour and I was getting

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.099 
of these sets per hour and I was getting
58,000<00:03:17.859> gold<00:03:18.070> /<00:03:18.609> 4<00:03:18.880> minutes<00:03:19.269> now<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.810> might<00:03:19.989> be

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
58,000 gold / 4 minutes now you might be

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.750 
58,000 gold / 4 minutes now you might be
thinking<00:03:20.140> yourself<00:03:20.519> 58,000<00:03:21.519> gold<00:03:21.640> that's

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
thinking yourself 58,000 gold that's

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360 
thinking yourself 58,000 gold that's
really<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.239> much<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.530> all<00:03:24.070> ends

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
really not that much but in all ends

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.449 
really not that much but in all ends
like<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.609> said<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.620> 58,000<00:03:26.620> every<00:03:27.130> four

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
like I said this is 58,000 every four

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.680 
like I said this is 58,000 every four
minutes<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.060> take<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.600> you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
minutes so you take that and you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.599 
minutes so you take that and you
multiply<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.140> by<00:03:29.200> 15<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.980> get<00:03:30.069> your<00:03:30.220> hourly

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
multiply it by 15 to get your hourly

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.000 
multiply it by 15 to get your hourly
basis<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.329> it<00:03:31.870> comes<00:03:32.079> out<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.440> almost<00:03:32.739> eight

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
basis and it comes out to almost eight

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.130 
basis and it comes out to almost eight
hundred<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.700> seventy<00:03:34.299> thousand<00:03:35.019> gold

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
hundred and seventy thousand gold

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.949 
hundred and seventy thousand gold
everybody<00:03:36.000> 870,000<00:03:37.000> gold<00:03:37.120> now<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.630> might<00:03:37.810> be

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
everybody 870,000 gold now you might be

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.449 
everybody 870,000 gold now you might be
thinking<00:03:37.989> yourself<00:03:38.290> per<00:03:38.769> hour<00:03:38.950> that's<00:03:39.190> really

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
thinking yourself per hour that's really

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.340 
thinking yourself per hour that's really
not<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.850> great<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.359> let<00:03:40.690> me<00:03:40.720> add<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.140> though

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
not that great but let me add in though

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.440 
not that great but let me add in though
this<00:03:41.859> run<00:03:42.130> right<00:03:42.340> here<00:03:42.549> was<00:03:42.850> actually<00:03:43.299> one<00:03:43.420> of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
this run right here was actually one of

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.199 
this run right here was actually one of
my<00:03:43.569> lower<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.139> runs<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:44.760> kind<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.790> started<00:03:46.060> off

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
my lower and runs it kind of started off

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.080 
my lower and runs it kind of started off
where<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.450> was<00:03:46.569> getting<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.870> range<00:03:47.350> from<00:03:48.090> 750,000

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
where I was getting a range from 750,000

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.020 
where I was getting a range from 750,000
gold<00:03:49.239> anywhere<00:03:49.870> up<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.170> two<00:03:50.680> million<00:03:51.310> gold<00:03:51.760> per

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
gold anywhere up to two million gold per

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.690 
gold anywhere up to two million gold per
hour<00:03:52.209> doing<00:03:52.569> this<00:03:52.810> run<00:03:53.079> now<00:03:53.739> does<00:03:54.340> kind<00:03:54.639> of

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
hour doing this run now does kind of

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.699 
hour doing this run now does kind of
take<00:03:54.819> in<00:03:55.150> some<00:03:55.299> factors<00:03:55.690> which<00:03:55.870> would<00:03:56.079> be<00:03:56.260> your

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
take in some factors which would be your

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.250 
take in some factors which would be your
damage<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.549> know<00:03:57.910> what<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.359> MP<00:03:58.840> level<00:03:59.139> you

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
damage so you know what a MP level you

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.879 
damage so you know what a MP level you
can<00:03:59.440> do<00:03:59.560> as<00:03:59.829> MP<00:04:00.280> level<00:04:00.579> gives<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.970> more<00:04:01.889> magic

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
can do as MP level gives you more magic

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.830 
can do as MP level gives you more magic
fine<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.370> magic<00:04:03.910> fine<00:04:04.060> definitely<00:04:04.450> takes<00:04:04.690> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
fine and magic fine definitely takes a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.240 
fine and magic fine definitely takes a
huge<00:04:05.109> part<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.410> this<00:04:05.530> game<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.769> lot<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.160> people

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
huge part in this game a lot of people

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.650 
huge part in this game a lot of people
didn't<00:04:06.549> think<00:04:06.579> so<00:04:06.880> at<00:04:06.910> first<00:04:07.030> but<00:04:07.480> it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
didn't think so at first but it

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.690 
didn't think so at first but it
definitely<00:04:08.079> plays<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.500> huge<00:04:08.769> role<00:04:08.889> so<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.549> more
