our new house look at that that is a 50
by<00:01:41.759> 50<00:01:41.840> blocks<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.000> forever

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
by 50 blocks it's going to take forever

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.139 
by 50 blocks it's going to take forever
to<00:01:45.540> actually<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.310> 50<00:01:47.670> blocks<00:01:47.880> by

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to actually get it but it's 50 blocks by

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.249 
to actually get it but it's 50 blocks by
50<00:01:48.420> blocks<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:48.960> 40<00:01:49.500> blocks<00:01:49.920> high<00:01:50.399> on

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
50 blocks and it's 40 blocks high on

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
50 blocks and it's 40 blocks high on
inside<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.549> another<00:01:53.790> like

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
inside and I think we have another like

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
inside and I think we have another like

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
right now we've been playing this for a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.320 
right now we've been playing this for a
while<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.270> time<00:02:34.480> played<00:02:34.870> that's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
while if you see the time played that's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.500 
while if you see the time played that's
22,000<00:02:37.350> seconds<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.670> that's<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.760> lot<00:02:40.000> I'm<00:02:40.330> not

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
22,000 seconds and that's a lot I'm not

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.790 
22,000 seconds and that's a lot I'm not
sure<00:02:40.570> exactly<00:02:41.050> how<00:02:41.170> many<00:02:41.260> minutes<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.770> is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
sure exactly how many minutes that is

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.080 
sure exactly how many minutes that is
but<00:02:42.550> there's<00:02:42.910> 60<00:02:43.240> seconds<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.840> minute<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
but there's 60 seconds in a minute and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.970 
but there's 60 seconds in a minute and
they're<00:02:46.090> 60<00:02:46.510> minutes<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.870> an<00:02:46.930> hour<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.530> 6<00:02:47.920> times

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
they're 60 minutes in an hour so 6 times

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.710 
they're 60 minutes in an hour so 6 times
6<00:02:49.620> 240<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.950> right<00:02:51.750> 60<00:02:53.190> maybe<00:02:54.330> 2040<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.420> an<00:02:55.540> hour

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
6 240 so right 60 maybe 2040 is an hour

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.570
