00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.119
 Hello 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.349
 a mother drove a time that represents 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:32.829
 is very easy and so jo 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:37.480
 from the side of the churches 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.980
 that 's why i go to the stopwatches in 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.949
 main menu on the stopwatches and 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:50.050
 sensors structures I choose over 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:53.379
 plus sign a new structure templar 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.199
 that was one too many now I'm going up 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:03.250
 I describe the key as a motor 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 clock so I know what I later 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.210
 have made 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:26.410
 at the same time is good with it 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 I have the city I leave free 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.820
 that's standard now we have to choose 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.200
 on which switches and the clock 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.840
 will react if so now 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.650
 be switched on or gas nipples 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.409
 I like that on the box I will have 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.200
 the guest apple here 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 as you can see that even right now 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.830
 was hit because he is idle 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.510
 tick and full throttle is tick 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.370
 So one could if one 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.680
 He makes breakfast here over the white 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:04.690
 that change but that fits that way now 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:09.399
 okay that would be this min and now where 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.030
 we already have that in the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.030
 amount 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.150
 advanced settings sticks switch 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.920
 so that we can adjust here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.980
 way the clock should run and then 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.840
 not now i see this is a price 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.480
 It's not my donor then I talk 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.530
 about this fall the notrad my 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.079
 host 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.280
 that he is there that I can check 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.280
 I wanted to move now I go up 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.269
 the beam one echoed 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.870
 because I want it here that's nice 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.540
 100 percent namely that's the clock 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.940
 So always in every position is quasi 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.700
 the one condition is echoed in and out 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.379
 the second condition when that is off 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.629
 that is, these two bars determine 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:08.750
 the one bar is for a whole 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:11.159
 gone and the other banks left short here 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.730
 moment neither can I do it now 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:18.260
 please is 20 forward who 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.760
 One hundred percent missing here a bit 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 What I 'm doing at the moment , I turn 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.359
 at about so if the girl 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.699
 So 84 percent of that disappears 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.739
 about 8mm or how much like me 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:36.109
 I'm used to that then that I am not 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.780
 gas has that is ok to press 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.639
 and the clock is set up now 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.769
 if i can make it out of a menu 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:48.989
 I can check that the clock is running 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:51.419
 yes you can see it and you can stand in 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.400
 the tons on other functions 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:57.120
 still set but that next time 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.220
 Video 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.220
 I thank you, she tells me
