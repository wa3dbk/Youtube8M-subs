we're<00:00:05.979> gonna<00:00:06.100> do<00:00:06.279> a<00:00:06.310> quick<00:00:06.490> comparison<00:00:06.700> here

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.510 
we're gonna do a quick comparison here

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.129 
we're gonna do a quick comparison here
of<00:00:07.720> five<00:00:08.050> millimeter<00:00:08.680> m5<00:00:09.429> and<00:00:09.820> c6<00:00:10.510> LED

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
of five millimeter m5 and c6 LED

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.820 
of five millimeter m5 and c6 LED
Christmas<00:00:11.589> lights<00:00:11.650> trance<00:00:13.230> first<00:00:14.230> off<00:00:14.410> is<00:00:14.709> the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
Christmas lights trance first off is the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.140 
Christmas lights trance first off is the
5<00:00:15.039> millimeter<00:00:15.339> strand<00:00:17.790> that's<00:00:18.790> just<00:00:19.060> a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
5 millimeter strand that's just a

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.540 
5 millimeter strand that's just a
5-minute<00:00:19.900> LED<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:25.000> then<00:00:25.150> of<00:00:25.240> course<00:00:25.270> we<00:00:25.720> have

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
5-minute LED and then of course we have

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.849 
5-minute LED and then of course we have
the<00:00:27.550> m5<00:00:28.030> and<00:00:29.430> our<00:00:30.430> strands<00:00:30.760> are<00:00:30.970> faceted<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
the m5 and our strands are faceted and

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.270 
the m5 and our strands are faceted and
then<00:00:35.859> the<00:00:36.039> c6<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:38.559> is<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.739> little<00:00:38.949> bit<00:00:39.070> bigger

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
then the c6 which is a little bit bigger

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000 
then the c6 which is a little bit bigger
bulb<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.600> we'll<00:00:41.019> see<00:00:41.320> if<00:00:41.379> we<00:00:41.469> can<00:00:41.679> get<00:00:41.859> all

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
bulb and we'll see if we can get all

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.229 
bulb and we'll see if we can get all
these<00:00:43.320> great<00:00:44.320> side<00:00:44.739> by<00:00:44.949> side<00:00:45.309> here<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:45.879> a<00:00:45.909> quick

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
these great side by side here is a quick

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.169 
these great side by side here is a quick
look<00:00:46.870> now<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.649> can<00:00:50.769> see<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.039> c6<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.789> m5

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
look now you can see the c6 and the m5

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.450 
look now you can see the c6 and the m5
pretty<00:00:53.019> much<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.379> same<00:00:53.620> as<00:00:53.800> far<00:00:54.039> as<00:00:54.190> length

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
pretty much the same as far as length

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.809 
pretty much the same as far as length
you<00:00:54.789> just<00:00:54.999> have<00:00:55.149> a<00:00:55.179> bigger<00:00:56.609> plastic<00:00:57.609> cover

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
you just have a bigger plastic cover

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.700 
you just have a bigger plastic cover
with<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.120> LED<00:00:58.449> all<00:00:58.690> three<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.199> these<00:00:59.289> strands

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
with the LED all three of these strands

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.680 
with the LED all three of these strands
use<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.190> same<00:01:00.429> LED<00:01:00.969> they<00:01:01.359> just<00:01:01.569> have

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
use the same LED they just have

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.980 
use the same LED they just have
different<00:01:01.719> covers<00:01:02.469> over

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.360 

all<00:01:10.990> right<00:01:11.140> all<00:01:11.260> lit<00:01:11.470> up<00:01:11.500> here<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.160> can<00:01:12.340> see

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
all right all lit up here you can see

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.690 
all right all lit up here you can see
that<00:01:12.910> the<00:01:13.570> five<00:01:13.750> millimeter<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:15.460> just<00:01:15.610> a

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
that the five millimeter it's just a

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.310 
that the five millimeter it's just a
little<00:01:15.850> bit<00:01:16.060> sharper<00:01:16.360> point<00:01:16.810> there's<00:01:17.140> not<00:01:17.260> a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
little bit sharper point there's not a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.220 
little bit sharper point there's not a
lot<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.560> lens<00:01:17.860> there<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.280> diffuse<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.820> light

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
lot of lens there to diffuse the light

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.930 
lot of lens there to diffuse the light
and<00:01:20.230> then<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.830> m5<00:01:21.400> by<00:01:21.730> it

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.000 

so<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.180> side<00:01:25.420> by<00:01:25.450> side<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:26.110> course<00:01:26.320> has<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> lens

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
so you side by side of course has a lens

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.780 
so you side by side of course has a lens
in<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.550> kind<00:01:27.730> of<00:01:27.790> diffuse<00:01:28.090> your<00:01:28.330> light<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
in it to kind of diffuse your light and

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.280 
in it to kind of diffuse your light and
then<00:01:31.060> even<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.420> bigger<00:01:31.660> light<00:01:33.120> with<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.240> c6

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.500 

just<00:01:38.290> spreads<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:38.800> little<00:01:38.980> bit<00:01:39.100> more<00:01:39.510> let's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
just spreads it a little bit more let's

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.480 
just spreads it a little bit more let's
go<00:01:40.660> ahead<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.990> take<00:01:41.140> these<00:01:41.290> outside<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.130> get

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
go ahead and take these outside and get

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.070 
go ahead and take these outside and get
them<00:01:42.580> installed<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.450> can<00:01:43.600> see<00:01:43.900> them<00:01:44.050> a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
them installed so you can see them a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.149 
them installed so you can see them a
little<00:01:45.070> bit<00:01:45.310> more<00:01:45.340> real<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.300> puce

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.090 

all<00:01:54.159> right<00:01:54.460> now<00:01:54.670> we're<00:01:54.820> shooting<00:01:55.150> outside<00:01:55.299> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
all right now we're shooting outside and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.890 
all right now we're shooting outside and
on<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.310> right<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.759> five-millimeter<00:01:58.360> and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
on the right is a five-millimeter and

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.210 
on the right is a five-millimeter and
the<00:01:58.960> center<00:01:59.409> is<00:01:59.439> the<00:02:00.390> m5<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.420> I'm<00:02:01.899> on<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.979> left

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
the center is the m5 and I'm on the left

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:16.160 
the center is the m5 and I'm on the left
is<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.520> c6<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.569> these<00:02:10.750> are<00:02:10.899> all<00:02:11.050> warm<00:02:11.350> white

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.259 

you<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.350> see<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.620> course<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.130> c6<00:02:18.670> does<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.239> a

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
you can see of course the c6 does have a

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.559 
you can see of course the c6 does have a
little<00:02:19.480> bit<00:02:20.310> bigger<00:02:21.310> bright<00:02:21.700> spot<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.450> of

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
little bit bigger bright spot and of

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.150 
little bit bigger bright spot and of
course<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> bright<00:02:23.110> spot<00:02:23.380> gets<00:02:23.650> smaller<00:02:23.920> as

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
course the bright spot gets smaller as

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
course the bright spot gets smaller as
you<00:02:24.220> go<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.850> 5<00:02:25.630> millimeter<00:02:26.850> walk<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.090> on

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
you go to the 5 millimeter walk it on

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:38.819 
you go to the 5 millimeter walk it on
these<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.920> 5<00:02:33.190> millimeter

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:51.330 

go<00:02:39.829> halves<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.280> em<00:02:40.459> thighs<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:44.620> see<00:02:45.620> sixes

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:01.190 

back<00:02:52.340> crossed<00:02:52.909> here

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.740 

then<00:03:02.200> I'll<00:03:02.470> take<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.740> few<00:03:03.010> steps<00:03:03.280> back<00:03:03.460> here

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.980 

take<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> closer<00:03:11.110> look<00:03:11.350> from<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.770> distance
