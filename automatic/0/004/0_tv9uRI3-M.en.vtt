00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that there's actually bad and so I am

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
that there's actually bad and so I am
here<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.920> my<00:00:17.039> main<00:00:17.220> rig<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:18.270> seven<00:00:18.630> eight

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
here on my main rig my seven eight

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.859 
here on my main rig my seven eight

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
seventy with hyper-threading disabled

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.730 
seventy with hyper-threading disabled

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
and at four gigahertz and one plane

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.189 
and at four gigahertz and one plane
supposed<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.920> one<00:00:29.070> point<00:00:29.340> one<00:00:29.490> eight<00:00:29.519> volts

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
supposed to be one point one eight volts

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.720 
supposed to be one point one eight volts
but<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.380> fluctuating<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.160> bit<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.399> have

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
but it's fluctuating a bit and so I have

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940 
but it's fluctuating a bit and so I have
that<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.420> also<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.930> five<00:00:37.170> seven<00:00:37.559> fifty

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that and I also have I five seven fifty

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.450 
that and I also have I five seven fifty

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
at the same clock speed with the nhd 14
on<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.250> wanted<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:45.350> show<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.410> guys

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
on it and so I wanted to show you guys

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
on it and so I wanted to show you guys
the<00:00:46.739> difference<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.190> temps

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the difference in temps

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
the difference in temps
did<00:00:50.059> some<00:00:51.059> prime<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:53.750> want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> do

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
did some prime but I just want to do

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.619 
did some prime but I just want to do
this<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> show<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> guys<00:00:55.770> proof<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.420> just

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
this to show you guys proof so I'm just

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.060 
this to show you guys proof so I'm just
gonna<00:00:57.809> keep<00:00:57.960> my<00:00:58.079> idols<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.739> those<00:00:58.859> aren't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
gonna keep my idols because those aren't

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.310 
gonna keep my idols because those aren't
gonna<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.579> any<00:00:59.820> more<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:01.430> here<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.320> 56

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
gonna go down any more but here it is 56

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.060 
gonna go down any more but here it is 56
35<00:01:04.920> 35<00:01:05.309> 35<00:01:05.600> some<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.720> main<00:01:06.930> rig<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:07.890> water

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
35 35 35 some on main rig with my water

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.940 
35 35 35 some on main rig with my water
cooling<00:01:08.780> average<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.960> 35.2<00:01:10.380> 5<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:12.049> time<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.620 

329<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.299> under

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
329 so we're going to get this under

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.420 
329 so we're going to get this under
prime

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.400 

and<00:01:24.610> I'm<00:01:25.330> gonna<00:01:25.480> go<00:01:25.660> ahead<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:25.870> hit<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
and I'm gonna go ahead and hit the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.300 
and I'm gonna go ahead and hit the
button<00:01:26.710> on<00:01:27.040> my<00:01:27.220> KVM<00:01:27.790> switch<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:29.040> now<00:01:30.040> we<00:01:30.100> are

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
button on my KVM switch and now we are

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.470 
button on my KVM switch and now we are
over<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.820> my<00:01:31.030> LAN<00:01:31.180> rig<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.090> can<00:01:34.240> see<00:01:34.420> is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
over to my LAN rig which you can see is

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.740 
over to my LAN rig which you can see is
an<00:01:34.720> i5<00:01:35.110> 750<00:01:35.970> slightly<00:01:36.970> about<00:01:37.180> 4<00:01:37.390> gigahertz

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
an i5 750 slightly about 4 gigahertz

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.440 
an i5 750 slightly about 4 gigahertz
there's<00:01:38.170> nothing<00:01:38.410> I<00:01:38.500> can<00:01:38.650> do<00:01:38.740> about<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.160> it's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
there's nothing I can do about that it's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.710 
there's nothing I can do about that it's
my<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:42.250> board<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:45.040> V<00:01:45.400> group<00:01:45.580> control<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.660> a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
my my board and the V group control is a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.960 
my my board and the V group control is a
lot<00:01:47.050> better<00:01:47.260> on<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.470> board<00:01:47.740> as<00:01:48.550> you<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.760> see

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
lot better on this board as you can see

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.520 
lot better on this board as you can see
it's<00:01:49.120> staying<00:01:49.420> at<00:01:49.540> one<00:01:49.660> point<00:01:49.870> two<00:01:50.110> oh<00:01:50.140> eight

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
it's staying at one point two oh eight

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.970 
it's staying at one point two oh eight
volts<00:01:50.800> putting<00:01:51.790> my<00:01:51.880> four<00:01:52.120> cores<00:01:52.440> that's<00:01:53.440> it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
volts putting my four cores that's it

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.630 
volts putting my four cores that's it
here's<00:01:54.640> my<00:01:54.790> minimums<00:01:55.240> at<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> Noctua<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.280 

Saturday<00:02:00.640> calculated<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.960> can<00:02:02.110> see

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
Saturday calculated that so you can see

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.720 
Saturday calculated that so you can see
that<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:03.100> uh<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:04.630> worse<00:02:04.870> but<00:02:05.620> so<00:02:06.430> I'm<00:02:06.640> gonna

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
that it's uh it's worse but so I'm gonna

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.450 
that it's uh it's worse but so I'm gonna
get<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.150> under<00:02:07.420> load<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.990> it's<00:02:08.350> at<00:02:08.470> 3:30<00:02:09.040> so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
get this under load and it's at 3:30 so

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.860 
get this under load and it's at 3:30 so
I'll<00:02:09.790> catch<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.119> guys<00:02:10.240> back<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.869> ten<00:02:11.380> minutes

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
I'll catch you guys back in ten minutes

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.420 

all<00:02:14.349> right<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.739> been<00:02:14.769> about<00:02:14.890> 10<00:02:15.250> minutes

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
all right so it's been about 10 minutes

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.940 
all right so it's been about 10 minutes
and<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.170> guy<00:02:17.290> 7

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
and this is the guy 7

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.080 
and this is the guy 7
there's<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.450> load<00:02:19.720> volts<00:02:20.310> 4<00:02:21.310> gigahertz<00:02:21.640> still

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
there's the load volts 4 gigahertz still

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.309 
there's the load volts 4 gigahertz still
and<00:02:22.590> there's<00:02:23.590> our<00:02:23.739> temps<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.519> let<00:02:24.819> me<00:02:25.319> punch

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
and there's our temps so let me punch

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:41.990 
and there's our temps so let me punch
the<00:02:26.530> maxes<00:02:27.010> into<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> calculator<00:02:27.730> real<00:02:27.970> fast

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.680 

all<00:02:42.480> right<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.840> our<00:02:42.990> load<00:02:43.200> temps<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.190> 64<00:02:44.940> now

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
all right so our load temps are 64 now

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.059 
all right so our load temps are 64 now
let's<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.080> over<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> i-5

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.220 

and<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:54.849> can<00:02:55.000> just<00:02:55.269> see<00:02:55.599> off<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:55.719> back<00:02:55.989> there

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
and we can just see off the back there

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:09.370 
and we can just see off the back there
much<00:02:56.469> higher

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.430 

and<00:03:10.160> then<00:03:10.520> there<00:03:10.940> are<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.600> evil<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.260> they're

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
and then there are the evil so they're

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.130 
and then there are the evil so they're
actually<00:03:12.560> lower<00:03:13.330> than<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.620> i7s<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.870> think

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
actually lower than the i7s so I think

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.260 
actually lower than the i7s so I think
it<00:03:18.230> was<00:03:18.380> 74<00:03:20.920> 64<00:03:22.360> 277<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.100> almost<00:03:25.100> 14<00:03:25.970> degrees

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
it was 74 64 277 so almost 14 degrees

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.600 
it was 74 64 277 so almost 14 degrees
hotter<00:03:26.710> now<00:03:27.710> I<00:03:27.740> know<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:28.130> doesn't<00:03:28.310> sound

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
hotter now I know that doesn't sound

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.760 
hotter now I know that doesn't sound
like<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:29.030> lot<00:03:29.210> and<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:30.020> agree<00:03:30.350> doesn't<00:03:30.620> sound

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
like a lot and I agree doesn't sound

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.500 
like a lot and I agree doesn't sound
like<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:31.010> lot<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.370> am<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:32.030> little<00:03:32.360> bit

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
like a lot I am a little bit

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.820 
like a lot I am a little bit
disappointed<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:33.140> wish<00:03:33.260> front<00:03:33.440> water<00:03:33.560> cooling

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
disappointed I wish front water cooling

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.740 
disappointed I wish front water cooling
was<00:03:33.980> better<00:03:34.220> but<00:03:34.520> I've<00:03:34.790> read<00:03:35.000> online<00:03:35.150> everyone

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
was better but I've read online everyone

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.200 
was better but I've read online everyone
says<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.320> water<00:03:36.620> cooling<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.400> horrible

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
says that water cooling is horrible

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.040 
says that water cooling is horrible
during<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.540> summer<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.790> mean<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.540> that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
during the summer so I mean and that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.270 
during the summer so I mean and that
that<00:03:42.230> kind<00:03:42.350> of<00:03:42.470> makes<00:03:42.620> sense<00:03:42.680> too<00:03:43.070> because

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
that kind of makes sense too because

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.010 
that kind of makes sense too because
when<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.430> first<00:03:43.730> got<00:03:43.940> my<00:03:44.000> water<00:03:44.420> cooling<00:03:44.660> loop<00:03:44.870> I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
when I first got my water cooling loop I

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.220 
when I first got my water cooling loop I
do<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.160> temps<00:03:46.550> were<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.870> bigger<00:03:48.800> gap<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:50.230> this

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
do the temps were a bigger gap so this

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
do the temps were a bigger gap so this
is<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.470> guess<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.040> update<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:52.760> haters<00:03:52.970> of

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
is a guess and update to the haters of

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.150 
is a guess and update to the haters of
my<00:03:53.540> water<00:03:53.750> clearly<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.440> mean<00:03:54.620> it's<00:03:54.800> not<00:03:54.980> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
my water clearly I mean it's not the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.120 
my water clearly I mean it's not the
best<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:55.640> it's<00:03:55.820> not<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.120> worst<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:57.200> um<00:03:57.470> yeah<00:03:58.100> I

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
best but it's not the worst so um yeah I

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.500 
best but it's not the worst so um yeah I
guess<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.520> catch<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.850> guys<00:03:58.970> later<00:03:59.030> when<00:03:59.480> I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
guess to catch you guys later when I

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.150 
guess to catch you guys later when I
actually<00:03:59.750> make<00:04:00.050> some<00:04:00.320> progress<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:01.070> my

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
actually make some progress on my

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.610 
actually make some progress on my
computer
