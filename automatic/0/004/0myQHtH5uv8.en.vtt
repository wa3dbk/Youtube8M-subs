00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello my dear, today we cook 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.750
 less today we make a delicious 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.820
 tiramisu all recipe things and ingredients 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.099
 As always, you can find it in the bottom 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.289
 infobox and we start cooking 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.630
 Espresso you know that I the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.609
 have and nespresso coffee because 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 I take a delicious strong 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.660
 espresso coffee and makes so half 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.789
 Three quarter cup as I have them in there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 I have video but you need about 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.510
 Eight to nine tablespoons of cold coffee 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 It's hotter too, I got it for you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.880
 Hot uses equally well on everyone 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 case we can start then 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 I still had a residual debt 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 from my egg liqueur and baileys willi 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.460
 video and I simply tilt with it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 in a little bit too 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.510
 flavor but you can also have one 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.460
 Italian liquors then accept 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.949
 I bought these spoonfuls 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.350
 By the way, they are super packed four 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.539
 units so you do not get everything right away 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 I have to travel with each other 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.440
 today 1 because that's just a whole 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.199
 light dessert this afternoon at 30 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 be in the shade and a little one 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.320
 refreshing cold from the fridge and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.360
 That's where it starts 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 First, I take my tupperware 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 blackboard pearl I bought myself 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.369
 and not sponsored and put the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.409
 easy with spoonfuls and 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.290
 devil there's a bit of coffee over it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.830
 then it goes to the mascarpone cream the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.780
 just just 250 grams 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.350
 mascarpone unfortunately I did not have 500 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.869
 gram 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.390
 you can of course also 500 grams 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.670
 take no role and 2 to 3 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.890
 egg yolk then you mull that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 just take a mixer I have 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.310
 I was heavy today I was really too 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 lazy to take the mix out of the closet 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.759
 That's why I just enter 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 whisk did not take sugar 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.630
 forget about three 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.340
 tablespoon sugar makes it quiet pi times 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.320
 thumb that does not matter if one 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 you are little too much or too little 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.579
 know yes cooking is chaotic at the same time 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 me and then everything with the whisk 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.130
 stir 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.689
 next, I have a great one 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.640
 bitter chocolate and please take 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.159
 really a good chocolate from 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.920
 sarotti that does not cost the world 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.110
 melts the two minutes at 450 watts 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the microwave as well as hers from me 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.720
 knows 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 that's totally easy after the two 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.560
 It does not guarantee anything 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.480
 burned on and you can still do it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.690
 times with so mini whisk the whole 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.240
 stir and then you have a delicious 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.240
 delicious filling you will be the same 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.310
 See how I look at this video then 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.020
 have chocolate and now you go 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.120
 just with the whisk again 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.580
 pure and it blends into one 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.940
 wonderful creamy chocolate mass 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.750
 together and then you give the whole 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.390
 over your soaked spoon biscuits as 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.220
 nice delicious filling if you want 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.860
 can you at this point also one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.420
 give a little orange liqueur about it completely 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.420
 as you want and according to taste 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.580
 the next step is totally easy 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.010
 you just take your mascarpone 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.290
 cream and give the or better said 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.330
 that tilts over everything I have 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.250
 namely in the case also made the 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.110
 simply slips out of the bowl 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.990
 and you can do it well 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.540
 pour totally easy and then you are 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.700
 I'm almost done next 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.820
 from the sarotti chocolate a rib 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.470
 picked up and take there a sharp one 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.450
 knife and just have a few 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.790
 chocolate chips off it 's totally easy 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.500
 it will be even easier with one 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.780
 whole chalkboard chocolate but I was 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.100
 just too lazy to open a new blackboard 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.989
 what would I have then too 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.000
 of course you can do that 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.410
 pick up chocolate and that was today 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.140
 quite a piggish was mine 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.060
 That's why the fingers were very warm 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.800
 immediately melted but no problem 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.090
 i still had rasp of chocolate in it 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.080
 I simply have a container 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.300
 given over it 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.310
 yes okay with jamie oliver sees the whole 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.620
 something decorative but chocolate 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.360
 It's chocolate and if you like one 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.709
 flat black pearl like me then 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.120
 can you take the lid and the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.430
 comfortable on it 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.020
 and because the bowl is so flat 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.360
 probably fits in everyone 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.580
 refrigerator pure or her place 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.530
 an empty barrel around the bowl in the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.850
 to place the fridge let that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.000
 whole another two hours 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.180
 pull through and then enjoy enjoying 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.489
 with an ice-cold ice cream parlor, for example 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.289
