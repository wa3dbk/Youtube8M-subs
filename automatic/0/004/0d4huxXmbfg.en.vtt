predicting<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:43.980> earthquake<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.910> did

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
predicting my earthquake which I did

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
predicting my earthquake which I did
therefore<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
therefore because I'm not going to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
therefore because I'm not going to
predict<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> second<00:00:47.700> turn<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> game<00:00:48.210> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
predict the second turn in the game but

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.740

obviously Michael does so I know how he

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.340 
obviously Michael does so I know how he
plays<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.489> extremely<00:00:53.489> predictive<00:00:54.030> he<00:00:54.690> wants

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
plays it's extremely predictive he wants

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.520 
plays it's extremely predictive he wants

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
out switches out as I went he predicted

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.619 
out switches out as I went he predicted
the<00:01:02.280> head<00:01:02.520> smashed<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.030> term<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> went
