00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.170
 too excited with this from another 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.170
 lifetime 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.970
 on my way 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.330
 besides we have where to take if 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.030
 we are in a pokemon information x 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.350
 I have three new news today apart 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.830
 of the title as you see I have three so 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.870
 I start now let's go with it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.559
 the first news would be like the one they're going 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.449
 the pokemon bank the pokemon bank 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 basically it's a new application that 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.300
 have created the nintendo to be 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.899
 as in the cloud certain boxes are 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.690
 100 boxes that you have was at your 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.350
 disposition to save the few that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.230
 you want the editions that you get 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 this project is worth this application 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 worth money or is it annual payment per year 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.960
 they said 500 yen in japan what they are 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.710
 four eat 131 euros but I have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 targeted and quini 5,600 26 dollars 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 Americans then that already comes to an 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 cosica we can have it for free 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020
 called the pocket transfers that is for 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
 to be able to move from our editions 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.760
 black and white and black white 2d at 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.230
 from the little center of our game to the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.110
 Bank 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.680
 it's free that 's free but the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.010
 little bank is not annual 500 yen 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.410
 moment until now and the other is the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.590
 special case the one who has called 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.270
 to everything incredible, because what it is is 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.400
 that will give us to squirt the charm 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.680
 under and vulva south in this new game 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.730
 when we get to the luminaire that is the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 big city that we talked about in the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.210
 previous video will give us one of those and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.400
 here I see a problem 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.520
 squirt he is my favorite of the first 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.069
 generation and cold here is my favorite the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.590
 sixth I can not have two water I'm going 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.800
 to do for I do not know but in the end I 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.069
 I would pick and espn from plant espn I do not know 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.780
 what I'm going to do the truth 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.250
 I do not know the truth that I have a 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.319
 reconcome that I would like very much 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.780
 have both but of course not not 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.450
 can and the other because of course the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.060
 evolutions after this direct from 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.300
 pokemon we have learned a little more 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.910
 about the mega evolution bracelet or 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.250
 something like you see here in the video that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.100
 you have to touch like the bracelet 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 little ball they have in the bracelet and mega 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.519
 mega evolve stop evolving 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.800
 then let's go directly to the 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.930
 grain we do not go to the mega evolutions 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.459
 so that evolution has not seen it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.750
 of certain penalties the truth is that no 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.209
 it changes a lot as you see now it has a 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.230
 flower in the head changes his skill 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.599
 holly a skill is used 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.540
 the ice and fire type attacks 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.430
 they do half damage 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.110
 that is the skill that changes and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 add up to the special defense 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.480
 and little more than little else is either visual 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.550
 the flower a little bigger not the flower 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.610
 big the palm tree that carries behind but 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.920
 little more then the next evolution goes 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.420
 to be hoisting who does not like mega 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.120
 I think it's one of the most 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.310
 expected among the fans have horns 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.970
 nail 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.709
 like swords in the arms so it seems 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.020
 to crack looks more like a dragon and follows 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.870
 without being a dragon it is not flying fire 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.260
 but but good is one of the most anticipated 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.030
 that I believe that they are among those 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.519
 more wait because most people 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.590
 he likes more charm under I think so 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.650
 changes the drought life by the way and the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.810
 last mega blas toys for me of the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.940
 best mega evolution is the best 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.099
 sure many will agree with me 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.650
 street talk I imagined it like this according to 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.519
 you talk twist with a mega cannon 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.739
 giant talking about mega his skill is 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.390
 it's called mega trigger that is a 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.269
 new skill by the way that only 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.919
 has the moment and that enhances 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.090
 Pulse movements like hydro pulse 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.669
 shady pool making them more 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.410
 that makes exclusive devastating for 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.800
 toys 'r' in mega evolution that's what 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.290
 it puts so I do not know what we'll see soon the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.420
 truth is that I already liked to talk about this 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.710
 then imagine this is that it is 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.710
 a killing machine 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.610
 the good killing machine is that it does not 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.980
 I can say nothing I love it very well 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.380
 made by freak game in that 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.060
 If there is a move to attract 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.690
 new player to the old players 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.170
 again incredible the truth is that there 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.880
 that speaking already of frob here and skrtel 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.770
 it was clarified that if I had to choose 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.270
 between the two I choose squirt him that's why 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.450
 basically I'm not going to fuck afro here 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.600
 when starting our adventure in pokemon x 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.670
 and I already have it clear that afro here 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.100
 I'm not going to take it because I prefer that 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:15.060
 average but good talking toys 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:18.900
 what is going to be done I do not know what there is then 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.580
 I shrink to espn and tonight spin 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 Llama I do not remember because the game 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.250
 number of to catch because I do not like 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.650
 so I hope you liked it
