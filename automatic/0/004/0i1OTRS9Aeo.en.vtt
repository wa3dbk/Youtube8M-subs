00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
close so that won't be a problem

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
close so that won't be a problem
okay<00:00:49.320> number<00:00:49.500> two<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.309> especially<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:50.969> you're

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
okay number two and especially if you're

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
okay number two and especially if you're
shooting<00:00:51.270> landscapes<00:00:51.899> consider<00:00:52.559> orienting

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
shooting landscapes consider orienting

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700 
shooting landscapes consider orienting
your<00:00:53.250> camera<00:00:53.640> vertically<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
your camera vertically so if this is the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.229 
your camera vertically so if this is the
ground<00:00:55.920> you're<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.969> your

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
ground you're actually gonna have your

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
ground you're actually gonna have your
camera<00:00:57.510> quite<00:00:57.750> close<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> ground<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
camera quite close to the ground and you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.740 
camera quite close to the ground and you
probably<00:00:59.309> angle<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.510> bit

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
probably angle it down just a little bit

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
probably angle it down just a little bit
that<00:01:01.530> means<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> lot<00:01:02.370> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that means you're gonna get a lot of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
that means you're gonna get a lot of
foreground<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> image<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> field<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
foreground in the image but the field of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020

view<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> wide<00:01:05.040> enough<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.700> gonna<00:01:05.820> go

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
view is wide enough that you're gonna go

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.429 
view is wide enough that you're gonna go
all<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.659> way<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> horizon<00:01:08.420> okay

be<00:01:59.310> careful<00:01:59.700> using<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> polarizer<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.500> a

be careful using the polarizer with a

so<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> may<00:02:08.610> end<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.000> very<00:02:09.209> dark<00:02:09.509> blue

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so you may end up with a very dark blue
