 o know here to know the butterfly and 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.599
 here we have the manual gearbox that would be the 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.430
 march the laity there goes forward or 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.629
 back in front at will is do 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.659
 but if it reduces marcia 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:35.419

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:38.990

 You're going to leave with your foot on a hand axle. 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:08.449
 here the brake button if it was a 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.270
 logitech steering wheel would logically have here 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:13.849
 is the clutch that is much cooler and 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.520
 have the exchange everything real everything sees everything 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:19.430
