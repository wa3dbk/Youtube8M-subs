very<00:02:10.270> original<00:02:10.390> grounds<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:10.989> when<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.680> a

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
very original grounds and when I was a

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.199 
very original grounds and when I was a
younger<00:02:12.069> girl<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.610> last<00:02:12.760> time<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:12.970> said<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
younger girl and the last time I said a

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.910 
younger girl and the last time I said a
our<00:02:13.540> tent<00:02:13.810> would<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:13.989> packed<00:02:14.200> every<00:02:14.470> night<00:02:14.530> and

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
now we're only half full so I think I

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.380

think<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.550> community<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.030> London<00:02:19.270> has

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
think the community of London has

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
think the community of London has
changed<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.200> things<00:02:21.069> change<00:02:21.370> all<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.550> time
