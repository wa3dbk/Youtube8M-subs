here

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.810 
here
grew<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.900> into<00:02:10.320> this<00:02:10.470> big<00:02:10.800> massive<00:02:11.400> coral<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
grew it into this big massive coral you

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.990 
grew it into this big massive coral you
see<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.930> would<00:02:13.230> not<00:02:13.410> ever<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.460> important

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
see now this would not ever be important

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.370 
see now this would not ever be important
out<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> wild<00:02:15.660> something<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.170> size

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
out of the wild something this size

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.800 
out of the wild something this size
because<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.280> mass<00:02:17.490> size<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.210> it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
because of the mass size of it and it's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.480 
because of the mass size of it and it's
not<00:02:19.050> allowed<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.650> collected<00:02:20.040> at<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.280> size

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
not allowed to be collected at that size

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.980
