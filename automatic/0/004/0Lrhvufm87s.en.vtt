54 quintillion from as you can see at

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.200 
54 quintillion from as you can see at
the<00:00:41.520> top<00:00:41.600> um<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> does<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.890> um<00:00:44.370> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
let me get to it we have the teleporter

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.940 
let me get to it we have the teleporter
and<00:01:35.720> basically<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.439> way<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and basically if it going this way and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
and basically if it going this way and
then<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.610> straight<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> makes<00:01:39.810> sure

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
then one going straight so it makes sure

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
then one going straight so it makes sure
everything<00:01:40.320> gets<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> curse<00:01:41.369> or<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.670> i

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
everything gets on the curse or if i

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.330 
everything gets on the curse or if i
orbited<00:01:42.329> by<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.659> trap<00:01:42.960> you're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> want

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
orbited by a trap you're going to want

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.719 
orbited by a trap you're going to want
to<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.790> go<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.210> down<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> track<00:01:46.729> until

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to make it go this down this track until

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
to make it go this down this track until
it<00:01:48.270> gets<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.960> end<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.409> leave<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> two

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
it gets to the end and you leave the two

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
it gets to the end and you leave the two
faces<00:01:50.520> unstable<00:01:51.509> conveyors<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.470> them

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
faces unstable conveyors two of them

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.520 
faces unstable conveyors two of them
this<00:01:52.799> way<00:01:53.210> basic<00:01:54.210> conveyor<00:01:54.540> ramp<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> slows

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this way basic conveyor ramp so it slows

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
this way basic conveyor ramp so it slows
it<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.040> centers<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.060> unstable

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it down and centers it and then unstable

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.450 
it down and centers it and then unstable
conveyor<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.079> was<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> way<00:01:58.530> then

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
conveyor like it was this way then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
conveyor like it was this way then
you're<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.689> brown

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you're going to want to get brown

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.440 
you're going to want to get brown
blasters<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.869> until<00:02:04.070> we<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.450> close

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
blasters all the way until we get close

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.199 
blasters all the way until we get close
to<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> end<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.819> then<00:02:08.819> we're<00:02:09.090> going

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
to the end right here then we're going

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.839 
to the end right here then we're going
to<00:02:09.270> have<00:02:09.450> oh<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:10.379> god<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:11.099> course<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.819> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
to have oh my god of course that have a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.300 
to have oh my god of course that have a
war<00:02:12.180> nom

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
war nom

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.810 
war nom
ok<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.370> then<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.050> turn<00:02:17.610> we're<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:18.760> to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
ok so then at the turn we're going to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.160 
ok so then at the turn we're going to
have<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.240> basic<00:02:19.480> conveyor<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.410> slow<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.860> down

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
have one basic conveyor to slow it down

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.310 
have one basic conveyor to slow it down
to<00:02:23.170> unstable<00:02:23.710> conveyor<00:02:24.130> swing<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.520> side<00:02:25.320> one

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
to unstable conveyor swing this side one

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.830 
to unstable conveyor swing this side one
