00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
more of a rhythm the role players are

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.210 
more of a rhythm the role players are
really<00:03:01.730> stepping<00:03:02.060> up<00:03:02.329> each<00:03:02.569> game<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.829> I<00:03:03.859> look

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
really stepping up each game so I look

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.280 
really stepping up each game so I look
for<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.819> look<00:03:05.329> for<00:03:05.510> deathless<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.930> be<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.049> really

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
for I look for deathless to be a really

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.470 
for I look for deathless to be a really
barn<00:03:06.500> burner<00:03:06.739> going<00:03:07.609> into<00:03:07.849> Game<00:03:07.970> five<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.239> I

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
barn burner going into Game five and I

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.440 
barn burner going into Game five and I
have<00:03:09.349> faith<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.310> Dallas<00:03:10.700> can't<00:03:10.939> steal<00:03:11.239> that

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
have faith the Dallas can't steal that

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.289 
have faith the Dallas can't steal that
one<00:03:11.569> in<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.989> series<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.470> Game<00:03:12.620> five<00:03:13.299> but

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
one in this series in Game five but

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.699 
one in this series in Game five but
that's<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:14.840> going<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.139> be<00:03:15.230> difficult<00:03:15.439> i'm

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
that's really going to be difficult i'm

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.170 
that's really going to be difficult i'm
gonna<00:03:15.859> have<00:03:15.949> to<00:03:15.979> favor<00:03:16.250> san<00:03:16.609> antonio<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.030> that

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
gonna have to favor san antonio on that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.009 
gonna have to favor san antonio on that
game<00:03:17.409> but<00:03:18.409> I<00:03:18.470> my<00:03:19.069> prediction<00:03:19.489> was<00:03:19.690> 64<00:03:20.690> Dallas

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
game but I my prediction was 64 Dallas

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.629 
game but I my prediction was 64 Dallas
so<00:03:21.229> it's<00:03:21.470> looking<00:03:21.709> like<00:03:21.979> that<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.489> could

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
so it's looking like that it could

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.819 
so it's looking like that it could
happen<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:23.000> way<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:24.139> series<00:03:24.500> isn't<00:03:24.650> over

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
happen that way the series isn't over

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.770 
happen that way the series isn't over
but<00:03:25.790> it's<00:03:25.940> looking<00:03:26.150> really<00:03:26.299> late<00:03:26.540> for<00:03:26.569> San

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
but it's looking really late for San

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.759 
but it's looking really late for San
