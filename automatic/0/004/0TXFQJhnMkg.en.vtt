 but good this one in my world is the one of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.260
 a friend but you have to look 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:34.400
 Homer and tighten it as many times as 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:37.640
 they can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and they have to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.730
 press 10 times and he will give you 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.220
 Give you will give 10 donuts and raise 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.350
 ten donuts 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.290
 and 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.290
 this is what he gave me 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.330
 this is yours from Jeremiah 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.020
 springfield 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.490

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.770
 that's what you win and remember that also 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.640
 earn 10 donuts you can do what 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.760
 want with him 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.870
 with those donuts but I recommend 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.870
 that squeeze this and 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.160
 and tighten to have several 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.940
 donuts if they have done they have to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.940
 look for place or a trick that is called 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.209
 5 , but if they have to look and there he 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.880
 it's going to look like you have to download a 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.650
 thing as it is as here seems a 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.129
 small square 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.720
 of a dog and that dog squeezes it and 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.600
 you have to put the amounts of 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.420
 donut they have 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.610
 the quantities of donuts that have 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.140
 and they have to put them 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.140
 and then they can accept 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.770
 and they have to put a thing was going to load 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.050
 will load will load and they will 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.550
 look like how many donuts they want good 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.700
 with that donut one can do 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.440
 accelerate all things for example I 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.920

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.260
 I found out 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.380
 and for example to walk 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.230
 has gone to help and is already doing this and 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.080
 it accelerated and I have life then I do not 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.560
