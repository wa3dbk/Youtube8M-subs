00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.720
 to make the magic cube 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.570
 The materials are three colored sheets 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.539
 green shaped square and three sheets 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.020
 of color they like and also in shape 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.480
 of square and also a rule 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.550
 to form our square we take 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.550
 our corner and we take it 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.170
 until the completion of the sheet 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:42.670
 and we mark after we cut 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.670
 the leftover rectangle 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.739
 here we learn 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.050
 our square 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.200
 then we make a square of color and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 we fold in half 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.220
 then we doubled again to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.620
 finish the middle well and also with the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 another part later we take this corner 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.800
 and we are already to first make a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800
 third line 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:23.049
 and so with the opposite corner 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.049
 so the first second third moon 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.830
 we take another first triangle and here 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.310
 let's see a square a rectangle 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.460
 now 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 we pull 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.570
 we mark well 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:50.479
 and we download this part and we mark after 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.250
 we take that triangle and we put it here 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.950
 there is a line 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:03.910
 poplars and we crush here and also with 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.590
 the capo we're going after this triangle 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.290
 we turn inward 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.230
 and that also inwards after 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.840
 we doubled so that we stay like a 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.879
 square 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.700
 with two for home and we have to do 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:29.550
 one two Three 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.550
 now we go with the square and folded 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.600
 in half 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.380
 and then we put the sport back 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.800
 there is a middle line we mark and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.700
 also with the other part 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.930
 there is one of the middle and we mark the two 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.630
 triangles of the first second third 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.540
 line with one of our fruits 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.660
 and now with a contrary point we do 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.690
 the same first second second line 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.920
 we mark then we take our triangle 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.450
 here we will see again the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.660
 rectangle 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.660
 we speak inside we dial and we go down 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.660
 after 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.680
 we doubled our one point and doubled 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.150
 inward 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.670
 we have all practically the same 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.610
 we mix the plan here to give a 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.130
 line 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.060
 palamÃ³s 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.060
 and we mark 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.240
 and this is we mark it in addition here 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.190
 this plant left over 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.430
 we fold it in after 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.400
 we got here so we can stay 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.950
 you really a square triangle 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.000
 we add 1 2 and 3 and now wall of our 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.110
 flower gets more this point 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.130
 in this hole 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.460
 we put 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.240
 and also here 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.240
 we put 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.480
 and we put 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.280
 tip 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.840
 they have to give the three small points 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.710
 exits after we take one of the two 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.580
 petals 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.310
 we put 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.620
 let's invite the little girl 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.270
 we also take another 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.590
 we have 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.870
 in our adventure 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.050
 then the small tip we put it 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.330
 and this 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.639
 we also put it in our reading and 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.630
 we also take the third one we put 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.280
 we put the small tip 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.280
 we put our big tip 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.240
 and now we see each other 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.560
 in the opening there we have our cube 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.319
 magic now to open it we take these 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.080
 two tips and we pull after we take 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.720
 our little tip and we bend towards 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.360
 in 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.360
 and so with the other petals 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.699
 staying in bloom 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.179
 poplar points 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.179
 and to see it more 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.600
 we open like this 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.750
 us now to get what taken in 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.200
 that point we do not bend we put it in the 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.200
 bouquets 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.210
 we put it all we talk 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.830
 we put it in 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.610
 that's all I hope you liked
