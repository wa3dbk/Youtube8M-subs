00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello everyone, how is it and I am 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.600
 here to do a time trial mode 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 but I'm going to invite you to do it with me 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.320
 you can send if you want videos 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 answers I recommend you to do 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.770
 only the one that you only put the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 turn not the quick turn that you make 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.520
 so that you keep problems of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.130
 copyright and the conditions is to do it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.570
 in physics pro with the yamaha texture with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 the m-111 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.920
 and the valence circuit you can 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.510
 put what it is as you want me 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.820
 I'm going to play with a plot that you already know 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.220
 that to comment it is much more comfortable 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.590
 and to see who among all 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.560
 subscribers to see who is who is the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.060
 faster 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.710
 to see what time to see what time it 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.200
 can you can get it and see you 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.200
 Now doing the laps so far 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.840
 to see if I can improve in 125 8 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.730
 that is about to improve the two 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 laps and I've fallen the last time 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.190
 let's see if I can make a turn 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 good thrown took about six laps 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.090
 I think I've done about this 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 it would be the seventh lap or so 78 laps 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.340
 I think I've done to see if I can get down 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.039
 of 25 8 a 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.619
 we go there you can upload videos 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.210
 if you do not have a capture device with your mobile 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.270
 no matter how this is a 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.460
 little to make us all participants 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.890
 not here of the game is a good way to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.679
 chop you can also put me to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.880
 other ways of counting watch do it with 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.640
 another category at the moment we go fast 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.670
 we can do it with 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.990
 with moto3 moto2 if you want you can you 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.960
 say the slow circuit and you want that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.820
 let's do that on a motorcycle that we do 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.900
 this is a little too to put it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.340
 there also with the Andorran series 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.180
 As you can see I'm going to the limit in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.450
 skid 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.250
 the condition of this video is to go with the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.290
 yamaha texture like I said before and in 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.860
 Physics pro I do not care what else as 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.810
 put and in this clear circuit 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.910
 so he's going pretty fast to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.030
 see here you feel fast here you win 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.730
 a long time to see 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.010
 well it's not bad but let's see if I get 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.879
 go down 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.909
 it's almost a tenth time this part is 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.480
 part is not the piano is not worth 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.240
 eat it because if you eat the piano 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.110
 you can win there half a second 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.180
 and do it well without eating if piano 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.470
 I will improve the return to see come 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.470
 come on 3 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.230
 25 299 less than 25 3 that does not conform me 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.000
 I'm going to stay with this round, I think 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.280
 see if I'm well launched and if I'm not going to 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.300
 stay with 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.300
 with this turn 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.210
 to see what times I can see times 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.240
 what people do 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.350
 you already know send me video answer where 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.090
 be slower already lifted the foot 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.420
 he lifted his foot and I'm left with this 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.420
 weather 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.040
 well let's see if they are already 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.519
 times it takes a little bit in 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.560
 update to see if I appear there are already 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.239
 I'm not sure if it will be 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.409
 this -have coke but there are people who have 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.349
 done 16 113 I think that at 24 you can 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.230
 get to 24 with a good bike even 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:43.299
 better a 23 with the best bikes a 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.190
 23 9 447 with the yamaha texture there are people 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.819
 they put it on normal physics and that but 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.650
 well there you can see 487 of the world 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.870
 can not improve if you put a better bike 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.760
 you give more laps and well I want to see 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.140
 our videos and your times like this 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.349
 Goodbye, goodbye, see you later 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.349
 all right
