00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.790
 I wish you good health tankers Marat 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.460
 layer is the long awaited release with the new 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.460
 technique of new Soviet technology in the game 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.310
 war thunder what have we added t-34 85 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.520
 awesome just 40 foursome t-44 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:51.100
 from 2 sul from 85 millimeters to people from 100 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.380
 with a millimeter tool and with 122 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.930
 millimeter people most me 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.059
 Interested in cars of course 40 four and 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.960
 and su-122 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.960
 well then let's start the fight already 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.610
 you were born on thirty four with 85 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.010
 millimeter gun and as you noticed 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 This is a new card and we already have three cards. 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.370
 this card is called ashen orikon 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 I really liked her because two 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.090
 the rest of the cards seemed to me 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.020
 nondescript was not any 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.960
 notable places on how here there is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 destroyed bridge on the right 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.030
 some such highlands even 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.920
 interesting fee in general card 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.820
 it turned out interesting in the middle she 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.210
 so say such a big field 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.590
 open on the right we have mountains and on the left 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.440
 nysin here also added some 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.690
 scenery into the game and generally very very 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.690
 interesting map is also here three points 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.560
 arranged vertically 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.560
 which we need to grab and hold 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.340
 Now I would like to show you one 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.610
 a maneuver that ended with the enemy 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.920
 second here we see we leave for 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.050
 a stone that I like vartan del 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.330
 here you can always see visually 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.550
 the enemy that is, as the world of tanks there is not 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 disappears 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.690
 great reversal of such a cool world 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.570
 of tanks you will not make 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:42.830
 and visually we always see the tank but if 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.260
 we go from here as it is now by the Forest 2 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 he just lose his mark came running 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.709
 forever he can be beat 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.310
 it turned out well let's go now 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.140
 let's shift to 40 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.170
 40 four in war thunder and it turned out 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.300
 very dynamic and carefully necessary 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.330
 manage otherwise you can flip and i 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 already rolled over several times on this 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.730
 Tank needs to be extremely careful 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.730
 especially here on such descents 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.980
 avoid skids too much 44-ke 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.260
 interesting story though about this i 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.549
 I will tell you in more detail, but now also 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.670
 I will say that 40 four, though 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.519
 43 44 years old 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.040
 did not participate in hostilities 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:39.859
 Great Patriotic War 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.659
 here and she was conducted its production was carried out 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.519
 on a limited scale for the purpose of not 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.540
 allow reduction of t-34 85 release 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.909
 period of implementation of large-scale 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.939
 offensive operations like this 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:57.889
 what is the tank course was already in service 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.370
 of the Soviet Union but the war never 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.400
 took part 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.290
 constructively 44 was a representative 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.200
 as a new generation of tanks 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.170
 which applied after the war 54 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.020
 despite significant similarities with 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.910
 tank t-34 85 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.830
 constructively he had nothing with him 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.990
 total very interesting point we 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.450
 knocked out yagdtigra and we have all the time 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.240
 counted as a hit it means that 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.240
 it burns and in the end it should 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.610
 destroyed because there is no way 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:46.500
 cannot put out a fire in a tank at the end 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.460
 all this yako panther destroyed 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.020
 and here we are rolling out on and this second 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.120
 more and more I will definitely not be anything 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.490
 talk about tanks because just 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.440
 I want to show you how I am and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.820
 said there will be already separate video guides 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.080
 stream and so on here we are now 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.040
 we are on the left side of the map see 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.070
 bridge destroyed here 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.600
 all very beautiful struck me this 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:22.080
 card beauty and diversity 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:25.710
 go in the ass tank 44 and t-34 85 but he 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.140
 manages to set us on fire even though we 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.740
 destroy and even we will not arrange 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.600
 charge so that he too inverted 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.690
 3480 self-destruct but in itself it 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.150
 can not roll over well and finally 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.410
 the last tank I give you today 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.450
 show it 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:48.720
 and sous-122 120 mm gun let's 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.500
 let's see what she will do su-100 we 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.390
 immediately destroy it with one shot 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.300
 almost any tank is destroyed 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:01.680
 1 shot well unless Strelnik 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.530
 taken out may place so 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.320
 is a very powerful potyazhka though little 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:11.729
 armored well then dear friends on 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.430
 today everything is in the next part with us 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.220
 there will be new German tanks do not miss 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.020
 subscribe leave comments with 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.020
