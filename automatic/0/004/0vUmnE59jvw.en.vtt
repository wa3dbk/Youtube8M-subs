00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.090
 this is a height of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.980
 44 to 47 cents loose the bridge would 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.760
 scanned here you can see the stumps 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:48.579
 reparations I will do it 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.579
 to draw the preparation beaches 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.610
 Here we make the between 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.610
 leader of the bridge 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.670
 In this case , let me say the least 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.480
 frontzeck machine was created 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.290
 we still have to partially share here 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.020
 build up 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.600
 not from the tractor 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.470
 were taken into account 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.580
 Here we see ours solved 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.580
 reinforce the hacker 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.899
 for optimal support of the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.750
 ceramic to counter against 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.520
 Likewise, those behind the valley 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 contacts are strengthened so that we too 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.530
 a solid construction of the bridge 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.530
 shape 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.209
 just like the hacker set up by 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.220
 model of next it up is that so 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.300
 called fish mouth that we yes 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 usually model with wax 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.209
 we did now here 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.200
 to smooth ours 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:07.890
 Placed places we take with 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:14.730
 help the program smoothing 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:20.200
 therefore, we create a framework that smooth 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.200
 Shaping occurs here you can be it 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.370
 creates a high-quality smooth even 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.370
 shiny surface 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.340
 that was our constant muller now 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 And that's the way it is with all the money 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.760
 continue
