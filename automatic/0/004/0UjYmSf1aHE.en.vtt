on<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> back<00:00:23.189> burner<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.910> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
on the back burner because this is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.420 
on the back burner because this is
relatively<00:00:24.840> easy<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.710> compared<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> some

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
relatively easy to get compared to some

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.790 
relatively easy to get compared to some
other<00:00:26.580> guns<00:00:27.090> now<00:00:27.570> yes<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.529> beat

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
other guns now yes you do have to beat

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560 
other guns now yes you do have to beat
the<00:00:29.010> radon<00:00:29.429> normal<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:29.939> order<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the radon normal in order to get this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
the radon normal in order to get this
gun<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.289> that's<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> don't<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> be

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
gun but that's it you don't have to be

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.549 
gun but that's it you don't have to be
the<00:00:32.369> rate<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.520> hard<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.600> exotic<00:00:34.200> so

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the rate on hard it's not an exotic so

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
the rate on hard it's not an exotic so
you<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> decently<00:00:35.460> high<00:00:35.670> chance<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you have a decently high chance of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
you have a decently high chance of
getting<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> lot<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.079> people<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.469> have

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
getting this a lot of people do have

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.920 
getting this a lot of people do have
this<00:00:37.920> gun<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.210> reason<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.899> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
this gun now the reason it is so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
this gun now the reason it is so
important<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> 300<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
important to get to 300 is because of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.090 
important to get to 300 is because of
two<00:00:42.300> aspects<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> gun<00:00:43.410> rather<00:00:43.770> than<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
two aspects of the gun rather than the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.049 
two aspects of the gun rather than the
gun<00:00:44.370> itself<00:00:44.660> now<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:46.140> aspect<00:00:46.649> is

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
gun itself now the first aspect is

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
gun itself now the first aspect is
Oracle<00:00:48.059> damage<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.140> extremely

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
Oracle damage this is extremely

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.380 
Oracle damage this is extremely
important<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> raid<00:00:51.360> on

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
important if you want to do the raid on

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.189 
important if you want to do the raid on
hard<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.379> Oracles<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.980> hard<00:00:53.309> mode<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.879> have

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
hard the Oracles on hard mode they have

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.270 
hard the Oracles on hard mode they have
substantially<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.469> health<00:00:55.770> than<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
substantially more health than the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.189 
substantially more health than the
Oracles<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.789> normal<00:00:57.210> mode<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.840> having<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
Oracles on normal mode so having a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290

and comes in handy a lot now the second
more<00:01:07.439> important<00:01:07.920> aspect<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> void<00:01:09.270> damage
