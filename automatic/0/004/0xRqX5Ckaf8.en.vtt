00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.270
 very innovative non-stick in the line s 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.260
 or the miracles how are you and always 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.930

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.250
 today with news we have two products 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.350
 new one of them we will be 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 cooking that is our piece 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.489
 rectangular orange that is a design 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.350
 special for our kitchen and for the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.110
 table as it comes with a coating 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.240
 ceramic inside has a greater 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.220
 Scratch resistance has higher 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.829
 durability over time means 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.480
 that this is not the usual non-stick 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.520
 that until now had been presenting the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.000
 mark no no no this is something totally 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.500
 different world there also 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.420
 flame bright color which is the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.030
 new ceramic coating that has 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.430
 the launch now our company and 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.430
 the other piece that you are going to present the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.160
 another piece is something for a large family 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.920
 we have a 16- liter piece inside 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.290
 the classic line with nonstick 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.210
 way of presentation you are going to use a 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.860
 piece with the same characteristics but 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.650
 more girl that is a piece 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.630
 in the exact market I will be 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.310
 cooking for you to see the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.140
 operation that can also be 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.880
 doing in this piece nothing but me 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.920
 I'll be doing it in the piece of 9 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.350
 liters let's make a pout and what 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.140
 let's steam it gets a lot 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.420
 water not when we steam stew takes 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.640
 just a cup of water and I in this 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.550
 moment I will use the add-on 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.010
 strainer of the piece but you can still 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.750
 cook without the supplement if you have 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.090
 the complement we will do the same 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.550
 same way that is to say let's put a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.590
 cup of water and all the vegetables and 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.930
 starting with longer cooking time in 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.990
 the base above the ones that carry less 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.940
 cooking as is the squash how long 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.100
 of cooking can take a pout is the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.730
 in the same piece of 9 liters in 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.320
 of 16 if the mechanism is always the same 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.930
 first we are going to take it to strong fire 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.209
 once we break Borg we lower the fire 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.670
 and we already take it to minimum fire all the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.000
 cooking that is once the vegetable of 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.650
 up is cooked we are going to pay and already what 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 we have to serve 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.310
 and the rectangular font that is another 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.980
 the vedettes of today that you are going to prepare 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.079
 there good today I'm going to prepare something 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.480
 easy and fast that can be 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.090
 doing in the new piece that is the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.700
 chicken green and how is the step by step 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.439
 of the chicken first let's go to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.629
 preheat the piece as always 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.090
 we make for a dorado of meat or chicken 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.510
 then once we have gold we go 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.090
 to put the green onion and then 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.099
 of the caldito and finally the cream the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.139
 steam exhaust valve what function 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.349
 has and at what time we can open the 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.940
 1 the exhaust valve is used 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.519
 suddenly if we are putting meats 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.000
 frozen then that's going to prevent us 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.739
 that it becomes liquid in the piece the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.230
 stage form is not the usual one of the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.420
 pieces is in not what this stage has 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.310
 it's something new that comes a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.780
 drip system ie we 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.060
 we can be putting an oil of 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.370
 olive with a spice to be 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.799
 stabilizing the meat or being flavor 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 raising a chicken a fish is that the 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.209
 function that has this stage so 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.550
 different and for the third preparation 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.580
 today we still use 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.980
 in this case we are going to make a thread 80 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.220
 very easy blows let's prepare the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.890
 mass let's give it the 80 hits that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.780
 what he's going to do is classify the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.790
 we are going to put to raise and once well 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.010
 high we are going to cut the middle 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.100
 because of this mass we will get two 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.930
 Threads are going to stretch with the stick 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.520
 knead that at this moment I'm going to 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.580
 present also our kneading stick 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.020
 new line is in and well once 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.960
 that we have it well stretched the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.090
 fill in this case with onion the 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.790
 seeds that can be filling 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.100
 with salami pieces of ham with what 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.380
 you want and also the other option 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.900
 they may be making sweet as 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.180
 cooking time takes more or less the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.340
 cooking time will take about 20 o 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.380
 25 minutes and in this case it is written 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.140
 hot to the piece if always 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.180
 We preheat the oven to a high heat and 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.820
 for what is mass we put the ring in the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.930
 base and put it over medium heat all the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.880
 cooking 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.920
 thank you miracle if we stay testing 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.290
