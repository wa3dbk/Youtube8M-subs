fluid there's no cap on it because the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.880

it<00:03:04.319> will<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.799> if<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.099> if<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.239> grab<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.690> window

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
it will go up if I if I grab the window

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.800 
it will go up if I if I grab the window
and<00:03:07.170> keep<00:03:07.680> pushing<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> button

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.690 

and<00:03:15.380> there's<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.739> power<00:03:15.950> steering<00:03:16.550> it's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
and there's that power steering it's

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:32.280 
and there's that power steering it's
just<00:03:17.000> rolling

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.470 

and<00:03:33.290> also<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.740> door<00:03:33.920> locks<00:03:34.270> those<00:03:35.270> are<00:03:35.450> all

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
and also the door locks those are all

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:47.980 
and also the door locks those are all
broke<00:03:35.870> they<00:03:36.050> will<00:03:36.230> work<00:03:36.440> from<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.740> other<00:03:36.980> side

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.339 

they<00:03:48.800> will<00:03:48.980> lock

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.040 

I'm<00:03:55.349> going<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.830> hear<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:59.270> so<00:04:00.270> that<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.690> will<00:04:00.810> go

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
I'm going to hear it so that it will go

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.809 
I'm going to hear it so that it will go
from<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.440> side<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:02.040> they<00:04:02.160> don't<00:04:02.340> all<00:04:02.520> walk

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
from that side but they don't all walk

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.070 
from that side but they don't all walk
over<00:04:03.090> there<00:04:06.890> what<00:04:07.890> doesn't<00:04:08.190> want<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> stay

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
over there what doesn't want to stay

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.490 
over there what doesn't want to stay
it's<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.200> lot<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.470> other<00:04:10.620> little<00:04:11.010> things<00:04:11.280> too<00:04:11.610> I

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
it's a lot of other little things too I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.960 
it's a lot of other little things too I
think<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> cruise<00:04:13.830> control<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.610> has<00:04:14.760> been

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
think the cruise control is it has been

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.490 
think the cruise control is it has been
outs<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.540> basically<00:04:15.840> since<00:04:16.049> i<00:04:16.169> bought<00:04:16.320> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
outs of basically since i bought the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.430 
outs of basically since i bought the
cuff<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.510> display<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.079> radio

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
cuff and the display on the radio

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.379 
cuff and the display on the radio
doesn't<00:04:19.680> want<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.040> come<00:04:20.160> on<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> big

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
doesn't want to come on but it's the big

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.710 
doesn't want to come on but it's the big
things<00:04:24.690> like<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> heater<00:04:25.680> core<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
things like the heater core and the the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.500 
things like the heater core and the the
power<00:04:30.960> steering<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.760> can't<00:04:33.060> even<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.479> can't

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
power steering and I can't even I can't

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.180 
power steering and I can't even I can't
even<00:04:33.780> get<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> stick<00:04:34.260> for<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.650> anymore<00:04:37.190> that

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
even get a stick for it anymore that

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.630 
even get a stick for it anymore that
just<00:04:38.430> ran<00:04:38.639> out<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:39.090> couple<00:04:40.020> weeks<00:04:40.260> ago

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.070 

so<00:04:46.640> can<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.030> get<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> sticker<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.660> don't<00:04:47.900> want<00:04:48.020> to

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
so can you get a sticker I don't want to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.760 
so can you get a sticker I don't want to
risk<00:04:48.170> getting<00:04:48.380> pulled<00:04:48.680> over<00:04:50.020> this<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.260> those

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
risk getting pulled over this is those

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.800 
risk getting pulled over this is those
expose<00:04:52.280> repairs<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.790> really<00:04:53.150> expensive<00:04:53.450> the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
expose repairs a really expensive the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.600 
expose repairs a really expensive the
steering<00:04:54.230> will<00:04:54.350> be<00:04:54.470> about<00:04:54.710> four<00:04:55.100> five<00:04:55.310> hundred

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
steering will be about four five hundred

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.240 
steering will be about four five hundred
dollars<00:04:56.020> so<00:04:57.020> I'm<00:04:57.110> looking<00:04:57.230> at<00:04:57.650> least<00:04:57.950> another

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
dollars so I'm looking at least another

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.950 
dollars so I'm looking at least another
thousand<00:04:58.790> dollars<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.270> it<00:04:59.330> still<00:04:59.600> needs<00:04:59.870> a

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
thousand dollars and it still needs a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:10.240 
thousand dollars and it still needs a
lot<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.140> work<00:05:02.950> just<00:05:03.950> leaking<00:05:04.400> fluid<00:05:09.250> there's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
lot of work just leaking fluid there's

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.030 
lot of work just leaking fluid there's
already<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.880> already<00:05:11.030> leaking<00:05:11.450> right<00:05:11.720> now

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.080 

that's<00:05:16.040> just<00:05:16.220> what's<00:05:16.460> left<00:05:16.700> of<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:16.880> power

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that's just what's left of the power

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:33.450 
that's just what's left of the power
steering

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.620 

so<00:05:34.460> it's<00:05:34.640> too<00:05:34.760> bad<00:05:34.940> it's<00:05:35.150> been<00:05:35.300> it's<00:05:35.600> been

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
so it's too bad it's been it's been

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:43.300 
so it's too bad it's been it's been
really<00:05:36.140> really<00:05:36.800> reliable<00:05:41.950> so<00:05:42.950> it's<00:05:43.190> just

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
really really reliable so it's just

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.510 
really really reliable so it's just
going<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.580> need<00:05:43.730> too<00:05:43.850> much<00:05:44.000> work<00:05:44.270> now<00:05:45.010> and<00:05:46.010> it's

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
going to need too much work now and it's

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.920 
going to need too much work now and it's
hard<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:46.850> steer<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.240> without<00:05:47.870> power<00:05:48.170> steering

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
hard to steer it without power steering

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.880 
hard to steer it without power steering
anybody<00:05:50.930> that's<00:05:51.020> experience<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.770> know

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
anybody that's experience that you know

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.190 
anybody that's experience that you know
what<00:05:52.010> I'm<00:05:52.100> talking<00:05:52.460> about<00:05:52.900> cause<00:05:53.900> that<00:05:54.110> are

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
what I'm talking about cause that are

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.570 
what I'm talking about cause that are
built<00:05:54.380> without<00:05:54.470> power<00:05:54.830> steering<00:05:54.980> a<00:05:55.370> lot

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
built without power steering a lot

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.120 
built without power steering a lot
easier<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:56.030> drive<00:05:56.390> than<00:05:56.720> this<00:05:57.440> with<00:05:57.650> a

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
easier to drive than this with a

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:13.990 
easier to drive than this with a
malfunctioning<00:05:58.340> power<00:05:59.000> steering<00:06:11.980> so<00:06:12.980> I<00:06:13.310> put

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
malfunctioning power steering so I put

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.230 
malfunctioning power steering so I put
this<00:06:14.920> I'm<00:06:15.920> like<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.160> take<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.460> out<00:06:16.610> oh<00:06:16.760> I<00:06:17.060> know

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
this I'm like I take that out oh I know

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.110 
this I'm like I take that out oh I know
well<00:06:17.570> I<00:06:21.160> keep<00:06:22.160> tightening<00:06:22.460> this<00:06:22.730> up<00:06:22.970> it<00:06:23.090> just

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
well I keep tightening this up it just

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:37.930 
well I keep tightening this up it just
doesn't<00:06:23.570> want<00:06:23.720> to<00:06:23.780> stay<00:06:23.930> tight<00:06:24.200> I<00:06:36.820> still<00:06:37.820> going
