00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:03.430
 how are you going to pay this 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.029
 with a mortgage and preferably not with the lowest possible interest and as favorable 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.969
 possible conditions 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.969
 the state when there was an intermediary and the question of the council 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.249
 the middleman demanded multiple bids from the banks and then one decided 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.589
 attractive mortgage 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.259
 does not cost advice 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.569
 maybe not at that time 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.909
 It is the bank that rewarded the intermediary with substantial commissions 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.999
 up to two and half percent of the mortgage amount in the form of the 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.500
 closing commission m a continuous commission over the entire duration of the mortgage 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.570
 m you do pay this on closing in the form of a closing commission 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
 mb each a monthly installment 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.760
 For example, on a mortgage of 200,000 euros, you will soon forget 700 euros 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.890
 to advice 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.630
 anything but free 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.070
 these investment products and life insurance policies are also doing well 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 anything but clear 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.479
 henceforth can not be paid 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.509
 the costs can be as high as 40 cents, of which 50 cents for the intermediary 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.640
 talked about usury policies 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 that should be a lot cheaper, better and more transparent 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.840
 the minister of finance and the financial authority also think so 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.250
 markets that the sector controls 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.250
 because then it has the right to know what happens with their money 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.560
 That is why a luxury murder vi.nl is a handy consumer platform for 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 mortgages in related financial products 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.550
 smart vi.nl is a marketplace exclusively for financial products now 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.830
 without commission for the intermediary 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.090
 you choose a moped point and middleman with whom you no longer consult 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.400
 and advice rates 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.270
 the attractive fleet so far ended well 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.330
 the intermediary is an adviser to and really independent of the banks 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.840
 we not only continuously check our intermediaries for quality but then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.060
 often complete openness about recommended products 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 what they mean and how they are structured 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.049
 On our site you will find extensive information about mortgages and more 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.049
 investments with funeral insurance 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.169
 but the can make calculations on it and map out possibilities 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.169
 check premiums 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.349
 Finally, the JOC closely independent intermediaries also find this 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.009
 fully support our approach 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.299
 no more shadowy commissions 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.939
 now agree the reimbursement among themselves 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.689
 smart vi.nl 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.019
