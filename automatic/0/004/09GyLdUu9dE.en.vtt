00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
you're not really comfortable you can

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.070 
you're not really comfortable you can
take<00:03:13.030> some<00:03:13.240> fabric<00:03:13.720> glue<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:15.810> put<00:03:16.810> some

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
take some fabric glue and just put some

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.680 
take some fabric glue and just put some
glue<00:03:17.640> all<00:03:18.640> along<00:03:19.380> where<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.500> cut<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.690> then

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
glue all along where you cut it and then

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.390 
glue all along where you cut it and then
hold<00:03:22.990> it<00:03:23.140> together<00:03:23.290> one<00:03:23.770> thing<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.160> remember

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
hold it together one thing to remember

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.280 
hold it together one thing to remember
about<00:03:24.580> fabric<00:03:25.210> glue<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.990> sometimes

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
about fabric glue is that it sometimes

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.380 
about fabric glue is that it sometimes
doesn't<00:03:26.740> dry<00:03:27.130> very<00:03:27.400> quickly<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.060> might

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
doesn't dry very quickly so you might

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.910 
doesn't dry very quickly so you might
have<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.780> leave<00:03:28.960> the<00:03:29.140> glue<00:03:29.320> there<00:03:29.560> overnight

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
have to leave the glue there overnight

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.260 
have to leave the glue there overnight
and<00:03:30.430> order<00:03:31.060> for<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.690> completely<00:03:32.230> dry<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.950> I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:44.360 

like<00:03:37.270> this<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.990> nice<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.380> clear

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.380 

some<00:03:44.700> glue<00:03:44.940> put<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.900> right<00:03:46.019> there<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:48.180> then

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
some glue put it right there and then

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.880 
some glue put it right there and then
also

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.370 

right<00:03:56.550> there<00:03:56.820> there<00:03:57.300> we're<00:03:57.930> going<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.140> do<00:03:58.260> the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
right there there we're going to do the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.860 
right there there we're going to do the
same<00:03:58.590> thing<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.130> other<00:03:59.160> ear<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
same thing to the other ear and to the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.830 
same thing to the other ear and to the
legs<00:04:01.140> however<00:04:01.530> we're<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.730> keep<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.810> of

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
legs however we're going to keep one of

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.640 
legs however we're going to keep one of
these<00:04:04.170> open<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:06.240> after<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.960> glue<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.260> you're

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
these open so after you glue it you're

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
these open so after you glue it you're
going<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.920> end<00:04:08.010> up<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.520> something<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:10.670> this

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
going to end up with something like this

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
going to end up with something like this
as<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.800> can<00:04:13.890> see<00:04:14.040> where<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.820> glued<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.270> this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
as you can see where you glued it this

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.120 
as you can see where you glued it this
completely<00:04:16.140> together<00:04:17.660> but<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.989> keep<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:19.920> leg

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
completely together but you keep one leg

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.650 
completely together but you keep one leg
open<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.940> can<00:04:21.090> turn<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.450> right-side

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
open so that you can turn it right-side

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.410 
open so that you can turn it right-side
out<00:04:21.959> again<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.100> now<00:04:23.340> we've<00:04:23.910> got<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.120> little

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
place right here that we can go ahead

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.760
