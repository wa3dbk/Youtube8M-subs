00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:13.476
&gt;&gt; Artist Terry Karpowicz and triathlete Hailey
Danisewicz are helping test the next generation

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:16.976
of prosthetic legs, a motorized leg
that bends at the knee and ankle.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:29.546
[ Silence ]

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:34.266
This motorized leg harnesses electrical
signals generated by their upper leg muscles.

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:35.976
These signals are known as EMG.

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:45.996
[ Silence ]

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:47.976
These signals help tell the leg how to move.

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:55.676
Traditional prosthetic legs are passive,
functioning almost like a fancy walking stick.

Dr. Levi Hargrove from the
Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:10.136
and co-authors tested two different
ways to use the motorized leg in a group

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.856
of seven patients all with
lower limb amputations.

00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:16.176
One way incorporated EMG, the other way did not.

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.846
Each patient tested both
methods, but was not aware

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.976
of which method was being used at a given time.

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:29.546

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.976
The study appears in JAMA, Journal
of the American Medical Association.
