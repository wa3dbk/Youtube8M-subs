00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello to you azaz continue 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.559
 collect 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.170
 unique transport in gta wai city 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 stories and this time we have a mission 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.689
 zara him the most or somehow so I'm not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.539
 I remember a little low vassermana so 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.220
 sd ns mission in happen couldn't wrong 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.230
 read the first syllable something that is not quite 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.050
 I understand how it is read correctly in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.659
 general essence in what and in essence the essence of what 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.200
 this is probably one of the best cars 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:37.380
 which you can get in this game so 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 and finally we miss everything and everyone and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.140
 see for yourself this red infernus in 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 what gives its characteristics uniquely 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 well, in addition to the unique color 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.990
 the fact that he is very bright red he has 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.550
 explosion resistant heavy physics 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.770
 bulletproof wheels like but 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.870
 more about that later for a start advice to you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 all fill up your life if you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.430
 full of life in the background 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.100
 right opposite the exit lie life seems 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 here you will need them 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 you immediately get it the first time 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.900
 get this car but the process of getting 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.990
 than just watch the same red CFS 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990
 curtains 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.740
 Well, either straight to the point but help 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.040
 a little bit darker see 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.540
 full of a little bit darker all the same but it's in 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.580
 principle is not difficult to rule because 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.860
 A device that we probably at the end and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.790
 do if of course we find if 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.510
 the same red infernus so 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.260
 we are going to the standard place to the port on 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.310
 map this here is not not here but 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.710
 here yes here is a tick worth principle 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.040
 you wo n't have to go far 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.950
 across one island we pass a little 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.080
 the machine is fast so it won't make 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.649
 no problem 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.580
 you crash less and as you see 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.550
 the characteristics are now very good 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.690
 manifest themselves but how do i say get from 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.910
 the first time you might not succeed 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.360
 so what else would say such a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.090
 about another such rubric 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.310
 something on my channel that i started 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.920
 a hundred years ago probably before new 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.310
 years definitely pump pump somewhere October 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 the first part came out in secret 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.930
 multiplayer in which there was only a short 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.190
 description of some game modes on the network 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.700
 and after that everyone came across comments 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.840
 type and when will the gameplay over the network and 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.239
 the other I myself honestly am very thirsty 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.459
 play on the network with anyone but you say 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.180
 Kunu invited another will play bye-bye here 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.060
 services 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.510
 I'm glad I did it but my friend 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 some problems then others so if you 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.530
 want this video you need it either 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.530
 get that is see in the description you 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.600
 can find a link to his channel 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.329
 come yes I don't know what to do and what you want 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.269
 100 bernoulli did what you want there not 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.920
 I know put likes-dislike write 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.610
 comments take video zazy 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.070
 or 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.930
 In general, write in general so if 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.010
 you certainly want me to take it off 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.170
 video and so had to stop in general 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.260
 then what thought ended write to him 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.360
 write if you want to see our video 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.390
 who kidnapped and so we arrived and what 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.590
 you need to do now what you need 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.360
 can be faster 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.160
 call here that is, we just click 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.510
 square yes to the maximum and now 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.420
 when the mission fails we leave 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.670
 quite lives of us are being taken away and now 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.680
 did your car become intrigue 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.840
 unique not even stayed on it or not 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.870
 how to check here let cars go 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.150
 try crashing into one like you 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.000
 see, I don't have a car right now 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.120
 heavy physics means I was unlucky 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.530
 so I'll be back in a second new 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.510
 already attempting a second attempt friends 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.970
 I hope this time not lucky when I 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.660
 I trained turned out to paint with 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.660
 second try 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.050
 we go we go we go and so 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.320
 check yours or 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.750
 or is it okay let's pro and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.420
 inscription some small machines do not have to 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.190
 sorry again well what are the third attempt 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.920
 and while I tried to get there again 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.990
 I took the car, I remember that this car 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.790
 still must possess 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.560
 fire resistance so just by 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:06.370
 maximum squeezed as soon as possible 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:07.930
 Well let us now so perfectly well, 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.540
 well let's see the characteristics 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:16.140
 in addition to heavy physics, let's start with the wheels 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.140
 probably 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.650
 chic 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.650
 further explosion resilience 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:41.510
 Well, just like a glove further I need 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.550
 consider for refractoriness do not pay 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.140
 attention that I was disconnected and the stars 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.890
 what they are in this mission is not at all 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.920
 participates but in order for tests with 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:58.370
 I decided to turn off the grenade launcher 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:06:01.040
 so we look and here he as you can see the flamethrower 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.810
 too, can not do anything like 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.710
 these are all the characteristics now i am again 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.020
 look fire resistance 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.910
 bullets on them wheels for its stability to 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.160
 heavy physics and unique after all 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.710
 unique color after all he is a little bit 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.600
 more red well guys thanks all 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.180
 for viewing signed color so like 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.230
 comment with you I was behind everything 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.230
 good luck and bye
