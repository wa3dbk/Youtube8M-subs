00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.859
 2 minutes 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.830
 Today is a serious politics 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 Will in what the other so I use a complication of Tomah version 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:35.190
 Although it may be nearly 10 years 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.740
 Until then, there was oneself who wanted the vintage teapot street though 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.530
 Meet this mountain 8 z 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.360
 I wonder if the eyelids fall from my eyes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.960
 It's fine 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.960
 I guess that now the musical instrument 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 While keeping the goodness of the latest instrument 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.840
 Old but yesterday 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:00.030
 Say has both a warm Toka those things 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.220
 It feels like it is in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.430
 I have been using it for a long time 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.590
 Compared to something like low- calendar flights 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 The pitch is very 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.750
 It is easy to take, but it is easy to control 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.750
 That's why 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.659
 this 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.469
 It is said that it is big 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.469
 It is one 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.780
 Yu 82 z but what is to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.990
 God tongue before 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.720
 Are there any more original connections 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.390
 From bass to people 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.620
 Good connection is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.300
 There was a person 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.020
 I do not think 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.940
 It seems that after all 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.270
 It seems like the pitch or something improved 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.710
 Big thing neck Oh one to in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.490
 Roof movie on the choice of 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.490
 Sterling silver 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.380
 this 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.450
 Are two types okay? 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.020
 I think that's a very big advantage because this choice 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.750
 By all means everyone 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.380
 Let's compare and blow yourself in various combinations 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.940
 Fit 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.440
 For the first time To 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.440
 I want to try it
