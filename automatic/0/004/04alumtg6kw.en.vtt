I'm<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.699> go<00:00:29.849> through<00:00:30.090> each<00:00:30.150> layer<00:00:30.660> so

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I'm going to go through each layer so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
I'm going to go through each layer so
I'm<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> lift<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.279> shorter<00:00:32.880> layer

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I'm going to lift up this shorter layer

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.290 
I'm going to lift up this shorter layer
and<00:00:33.739> just<00:00:34.739> pin<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:40.760> smooth<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.059> out

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and just pin it up and smooth this out

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.440 
and just pin it up and smooth this out
and<00:00:42.870> once<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> smooth<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.360> you'll<00:00:45.360> see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and once I smooth this out you'll see

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.410 
and once I smooth this out you'll see
how<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.989> goes<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.370> better<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
how it goes in so much better with the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
how it goes in so much better with the
back<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> shine<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
back and you can see the shine that the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.689 
back and you can see the shine that the
back<00:00:51.180> has<00:00:51.539> already<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.500> using<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
back has already just from using the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.799 
back has already just from using the
brush<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.530> directing<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> dryer<00:00:56.070> downward

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
brush and directing the dryer downward

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.939 
brush and directing the dryer downward
so<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> use<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> large<00:00:58.649> brush

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
so we're going to use the large brush

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.689 
so we're going to use the large brush
and<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> worry<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.699> making

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and I'm not going to worry about making

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
and I'm not going to worry about making
this<00:01:03.000> section<00:01:03.480> any<00:01:03.629> smaller<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.860> you're

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this section any smaller because you're

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
this section any smaller because you're
wanting<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.610> lift<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:07.049> bring<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
wanting to lift it up and then bring it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.039 
wanting to lift it up and then bring it
down<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:09.119> okay<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> bat

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
down and it's okay if some of the bat

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
down and it's okay if some of the bat
gets<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.680> too<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> don't<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
gets in there too what you don't want is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
gets in there too what you don't want is
any<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.750> getting<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.680> then

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
any of this getting all in because then

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
any of this getting all in because then
you<00:01:13.979> might<00:01:14.040> end<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> mess<00:01:15.979> I'm

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you might end up with a mess I'm

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.080 
you might end up with a mess I'm
actually<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> turn<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> low

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.580 

and<00:01:24.210> her<00:01:24.869> hair<00:01:25.109> for<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> most<00:01:25.679> part<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.549> dry<00:01:26.969> so

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
and her hair for the most part is dry so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
and her hair for the most part is dry so
really<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.770> only<00:01:29.039> smoothing<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> heat

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
really I'm only smoothing with the heat

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
really I'm only smoothing with the heat
of<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:30.960> blow<00:01:31.320> dryer<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.609> I'm

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
of the blow dryer and then I'm

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.520 
of the blow dryer and then I'm
occasionally<00:01:36.479> hitting<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.929> cold<00:01:37.200> shot

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
occasionally hitting the cold shot

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.950 
occasionally hitting the cold shot
button<00:01:37.799> which<00:01:38.579> we'll<00:01:38.819> get<00:01:39.000> into<00:01:39.060> later

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.440 

and<00:01:46.140> again<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.250> how<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.970> directing

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and again you see how I'm just directing

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:59.520 
and again you see how I'm just directing
everything<00:01:48.750> down<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.720> around<00:01:51.720> her<00:01:51.960> face

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
so I'm going to take down a second

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.230 
so I'm going to take down a second
section<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.330> work<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:03.760> and<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:04.910> see<00:02:05.120> how

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.929 
you're going to get so depending on the
angle<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.049> choose<00:02:28.409> if<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:29.609> far

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
angle you choose if you go really far

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.059 
angle you choose if you go really far
this<00:02:30.209> way<00:02:30.450> you're<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.170> get<00:02:31.319> more<00:02:31.590> more

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
this way you're going to get more more

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.770 
this way you're going to get more more
volume<00:02:32.549> than<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.209> come<00:02:33.599> down

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
volume than if you just come down

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.140 
volume than if you just come down
straight<00:02:37.069> I'm<00:02:38.069> not<00:02:38.280> looking<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.909> whole<00:02:39.120> lot
