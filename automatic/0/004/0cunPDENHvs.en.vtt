00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.319
 good good then here I am again 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.429
 we are here with the second part in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 this case 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.539
 well I put the black ops for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.119
 teach him to teach you about the jeter 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.699
 and good also I will teach the pointed thing that 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.070
 you will only know it by own days 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.470
 previous but but good because I did not 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.740
 I had seen 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.510
 Well, the dessert is now worth the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.470
 heater leader as I said in the first 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.800
 video that I put is a let's say a trick 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.239
 in quotation marks or an advantage that uses 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.090
 which uses a bug in programming 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.230
 of the game for 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.850
 to do it is this this message is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.330
 designed to wiring from a shot is 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 say for this for the m16 or for the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.800
 bad fame in the bales menu for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.489
 for axis 11 that is here on the target 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.250
 So what it does is cut the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.340
 time between one burst and another 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.870
 this is good because everyone knows m16 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.470
 it's one time and it's a blast of style 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.900
 elite on this new chip I know 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.750
 it is activated maintaining it maintaining the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.470
 triangle and giving it the back button 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.300
 let's do it we keep the triangle 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.620
 good if you said you already have it 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.050
 selected simply that I have the yes 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.810
 he has paid I turn it on and you see that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.250
 it flashes pretty fast it's worth it if we do 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.890
 that from 'the to the triangle 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.870
 press back press twice 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.300
 slows down and that means that now 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.670
 same back is simply the fire 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.890
 fast then we're going to have the milestone of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.440
 again that will be then that in the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.930
 triangle keeping it there and giving the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.960
 little button from behind 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.900
 you see by word about fast well I'm going to 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 turn off the good chip as you already know how 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.970
 works this is worth the m16 when you go 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.570
 to see 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.570
 OK 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.010
 we press once well to plug in the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.710
 we are going to load we are going to carry 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.620
 Market Stall 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.620
 and you realize now I'm going to press it 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.770
 as well as if it were to change gun and what 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.330
 what it does is cut the time 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.330
 2 but I have a push button 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.160
 this is 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.430
 this is the limit because there will be a lot 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.430
 people
