the<00:00:36.270> microphone<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.170> talked<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> little<00:00:37.950> bit

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the microphone and talked a little bit

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.119 
the microphone and talked a little bit
about<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.170> now<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> picked<00:00:41.010> this

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
about it now when I picked this

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.819 
about it now when I picked this
microphone<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.270> around<00:00:42.600> $60<00:00:43.440> each

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
microphone up it was around $60 each

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.900 
microphone up it was around $60 each
which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> pretty<00:00:45.239> inexpensive<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.910> did

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
which is pretty inexpensive but I did

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.930 
which is pretty inexpensive but I did
look<00:00:48.059> around<00:00:48.360> online<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.309> reason<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
look around online and for some reason I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
look around online and for some reason I
might<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> different<00:00:51.629> model<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:52.050> something

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
might be a different model or something

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.619 
might be a different model or something
but<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:52.620> they're<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:54.210> cheapest<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
but now they're going up the cheapest I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.850 
but now they're going up the cheapest I
saw<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.989> around<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> hundred<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> hundred

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
saw was around a hundred a hundred

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
saw was around a hundred a hundred
dollars<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.390> that's<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.539> too<00:00:57.750> inexpensive

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
dollars so that's not too inexpensive

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
dollars so that's not too inexpensive
anymore<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.480> when<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> did<00:01:00.780> try<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.649> for

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
anymore but when I did try to look for

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740 
anymore but when I did try to look for
some<00:01:01.980> videos<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.609> microphone<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.270> mean

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
some videos of this microphone I mean

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.870 
some videos of this microphone I mean
there's<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.080> around<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> wanted

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there's some around but I kind of wanted

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.260 
there's some around but I kind of wanted
it<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:07.250> just<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.580> mic<00:01:08.820> here

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it has a pretty good range as far as the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.460 
it has a pretty good range as far as the
the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.610 
the
you<00:02:13.040> know<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> pickup<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.700> mic<00:02:14.620> obviously

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
you know the pickup of the mic obviously

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.200 
you know the pickup of the mic obviously
when<00:02:15.800> it's<00:02:15.950> closed<00:02:16.190> when<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:16.760> close<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.000> your

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
when it's closed when it's close to your

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:30.850 
when it's closed when it's close to your
mouth<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.720> sounds<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.140> best<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
mouth it sounds the best but and the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.080 
mouth it sounds the best but and the
other<00:02:30.920> thing<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.280> like<00:02:31.400> about<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.820> mic<00:02:32.060> is

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
other thing I like about this mic is

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.390 
other thing I like about this mic is
that<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.830> doesn't<00:02:34.100> have<00:02:34.190> too<00:02:34.280> much

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
that it's it doesn't have too much

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.780 
that it's it doesn't have too much
handling<00:02:34.940> noise<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.130> when<00:02:37.460> you're<00:02:37.580> moving

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790

commentating with this obviously people
will<00:02:48.950> have<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.280> know<00:02:49.460> move<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.730> around<00:02:49.820> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
will have it you know move it around and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.920 
will have it you know move it around and
stuff<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.760> think<00:02:52.970> there's<00:02:53.150> that's

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
stuff and and I think there's that's

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.620 
stuff and and I think there's that's
pretty<00:02:54.200> low<00:02:54.410> handling<00:02:55.100> volume<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.450> that's

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
pretty low handling volume so so that's

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.600 
pretty low handling volume so so that's
pretty<00:02:56.750> good<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.200> if<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.680> guys<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:58.280> if<00:02:58.550> you
