with<00:04:19.450> him<00:04:19.630> while<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:20.020> were<00:04:20.109> driving<00:04:20.349> and<00:04:20.979> I

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
with him while we were driving and I

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.780 
with him while we were driving and I
quickly<00:04:21.849> realized<00:04:22.479> that<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.110> route<00:04:23.320> we

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
quickly realized that the route we

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.360 
quickly realized that the route we
going<00:04:23.940> on<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.480> not<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.590> route<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:26.040> learned

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
going on is not the route that I learned

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.190 
going on is not the route that I learned
with<00:04:26.760> my<00:04:26.940> instructor<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.750> she<00:04:27.900> said<00:04:28.110> it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
with my instructor that she said it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.450 
with my instructor that she said it
would<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.500> was<00:04:28.710> looking<00:04:28.980> out<00:04:29.040> for<00:04:29.190> all<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
would be I was looking out for all the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.850 
would be I was looking out for all the
things<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.820> we<00:04:29.970> practiced<00:04:30.480> wasn't<00:04:31.410> there

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
things that we practiced wasn't there

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.970 
things that we practiced wasn't there

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
and to be honest I felt like that was

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.490
