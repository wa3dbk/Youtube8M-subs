there<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:28.320> could<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.830> difficult<00:00:29.130> or

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
there is a it could be more difficult or

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.099 
there is a it could be more difficult or
less<00:00:29.580> i<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:29.970> every<00:00:30.119> team<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.539> now<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.810> mba

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
less i think every team right now in mba

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
less i think every team right now in mba
stuff<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.489> gotta<00:00:32.669> concentrating

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
stuff so we just gotta concentrating

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.479 
stuff so we just gotta concentrating
ourselves<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> best<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.950> do

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
ourselves and do the best we can I do

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
ourselves and do the best we can I do
anticipate<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.969> impacting<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:36.960> young

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
anticipate that impacting the very young

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.569 
anticipate that impacting the very young
group<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> players<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.040> you'll<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.399> playing

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
group of players that you'll be playing

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.400 
group of players that you'll be playing
with<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.820> year<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> look<00:00:40.290> at<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
with this year well you can look at that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010 
with this year well you can look at that
two<00:00:41.070> ways<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.579> say<00:00:41.910> okay<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> role<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
two ways you can say okay in the role is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
two ways you can say okay in the role is
more<00:00:43.050> difficult<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.649> play<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> same

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
more difficult to play but at the same

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
more difficult to play but at the same
time<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.879> grow<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.180> faster<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> want

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
time you can grow up faster if you want

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
time you can grow up faster if you want
you<00:00:46.469> play<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> road<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you play on the road so I think going to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.729 
you play on the road so I think going to
be<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> challenge<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.989> got<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> new<00:00:49.289> coach<00:00:49.500> I

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
be a challenge and we got a new coach I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.170 
be a challenge and we got a new coach I
think<00:00:49.950> everybody<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.309> excited<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
think everybody is excited about it and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.319 
think everybody is excited about it and
am<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.530> good<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:54.210> with

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
am I think going to be good I think with

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
am I think going to be good I think with
this<00:00:54.480> short<00:00:54.840> training<00:00:55.110> camp<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this short training camp it's going to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.840 
this short training camp it's going to
be<00:00:57.289> really<00:00:58.289> important<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.039> ready<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.670> soon

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
be really important to get ready as soon

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.279 
be really important to get ready as soon
as<00:00:59.969> possible<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.899> build<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> lot

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
as possible because you can build a lot

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.540 
as possible because you can build a lot
of<00:01:01.410> teams<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:02.010> they're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> need

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of teams because they're going to need

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.759 
of teams because they're going to need
more<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.199> ready<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> think

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
more time to get to get ready so I think

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
more time to get to get ready so I think
we<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> surprise<00:01:05.369> people<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> beginning

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
we can surprise people at the beginning

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.510 
we can surprise people at the beginning
so<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.260> gotta<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.500> concentrate<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.159> day<00:01:08.280> one

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so we gotta be concentrate for day one

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.740 
so we gotta be concentrate for day one
and<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> start<00:01:09.030> doing<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> things<00:01:09.540> we

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

scenarios<00:02:32.880> from<00:02:33.630> mental<00:02:34.050> perspective<00:02:34.350> isn't

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
scenarios from mental perspective isn't

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.620

a bit tougher than the physical side of
it<00:02:36.690> potentially<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> think<00:02:38.459> so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it potentially I think so I think so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
it potentially I think so I think so
because<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.810> use<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> little<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.500> more<00:02:40.680> because

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
because we use a little bit more because

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100
