we<00:01:19.259> found<00:01:19.470> having<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.100> manually<00:01:20.520> go<00:01:20.820> inside

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we found having to manually go inside

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
we found having to manually go inside
your<00:01:21.450> Scout<00:01:21.900> directory<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.220> remove<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> files

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
your Scout directory to remove the files

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.960 
your Scout directory to remove the files
and<00:01:24.540> especially<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.369> show<00:01:26.700> off

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and especially for me because I show off

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
and especially for me because I show off
so<00:01:27.270> many<00:01:27.390> different<00:01:27.900> mods<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so many different mods and I have to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
so many different mods and I have to
compare<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> vanilla<00:01:29.880> version<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
compare them with a vanilla version it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.140 
compare them with a vanilla version it
makes<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.200> much<00:01:31.380> easier<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.549> turn<00:01:32.970> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
makes it so much easier to just turn it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.560 
makes it so much easier to just turn it
off<00:01:33.299> turn<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:35.310> record<00:01:35.570> before

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
off turn it on and just record before

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390 
off turn it on and just record before
the<00:01:36.900> mod<00:01:37.079> manager<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> spend

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
outdated mods right now because I'm

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.030 
outdated mods right now because I'm
really<00:01:59.520> lazy<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.659> update<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> a

really lazy to go and update them and a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
lot of times the updates aren't really

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
lot of times the updates aren't really
that<00:02:04.079> important<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.710> I'll<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.009> ignore<00:02:05.219> them

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that important so I'll just ignore them

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
that important so I'll just ignore them

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
makes modding simple and easy and I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.950 
makes modding simple and easy and I
really<00:02:12.030> don't<00:02:12.150> see

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
really don't see

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960 
really don't see
reason<00:02:13.410> why<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.590> shouldn't<00:02:14.040> use<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.460> mod<00:02:14.700> or

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
reason why you shouldn't use this mod or

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.690 
reason why you shouldn't use this mod or
a<00:02:15.030> program<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> next<00:02:16.980> mod<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> talk

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
a program so the next mod I want to talk

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
a program so the next mod I want to talk
about<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.710> tes<00:02:19.710> 5<00:02:20.240> acceleration<00:02:21.240> later

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
about is the tes 5 acceleration later

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080 
about is the tes 5 acceleration later
so<00:02:22.110> apparently<00:02:22.380> Skyrim<00:02:23.100> wasn't<00:02:23.550> very

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
so apparently Skyrim wasn't very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.680 
so apparently Skyrim wasn't very
optimized<00:02:24.810> by<00:02:25.080> Bethesda<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> risu<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
optimized by Bethesda and so I risu and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.730 
optimized by Bethesda and so I risu and
others<00:02:28.050> made<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.650> mod<00:02:28.950> which<00:02:29.910> optimizes

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
others made this mod which optimizes

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.140 
others made this mod which optimizes
Skyrim<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.920> don't<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.370> know<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.730> details

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
Skyrim I don't really know the details

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.450 
Skyrim I don't really know the details
about<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.500> basically<00:02:34.590> does<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
about it but what it basically does is

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.250 
about it but what it basically does is
it<00:02:35.490> increase<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.180> frame<00:02:36.480> rate<00:02:36.510> or<00:02:36.870> frames

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it increase your frame rate or frames

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.860 
it increase your frame rate or frames
per<00:02:37.530> second<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.700> Mount<00:02:39.030> really<00:02:39.420> varies

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
per second the Mount really varies

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.380 
per second the Mount really varies
between<00:02:40.050> computers<00:02:40.860> but<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.790> pretty<00:02:42.180> much

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
between computers but it's pretty much

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.360 
between computers but it's pretty much
been<00:02:42.570> proven<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.680> no<00:02:43.920> matter<00:02:44.130> who

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
been proven that you know no matter who

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.740 
been proven that you know no matter who
you<00:02:44.520> are<00:02:44.550> you're<00:02:44.910> probably<00:02:45.180> gonna<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.690> some

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
you are you're probably gonna get some

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.500 
you are you're probably gonna get some
type<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.410> boost<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:47.010> framerate<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.850> haven't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
type of boost in framerate I haven't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
type of boost in framerate I haven't
really<00:02:48.750> seen<00:02:48.930> anybody<00:02:49.230> have<00:02:49.680> any<00:02:49.860> problems

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780

well not necessarily essential I think

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.660 
well not necessarily essential I think
that<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.960> is<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.380> mod<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.890> most<00:03:35.130> people<00:03:35.460> should

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
that it is a mod that most people should

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.490 
that it is a mod that most people should
get<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.120> they're<00:03:36.330> looking<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.140> better

looking<00:03:37.920> Skyrim<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:39.450> me<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.780> essential

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
looking Skyrim and to me it's essential

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.060 
looking Skyrim and to me it's essential
because<00:03:40.650> once<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.430> take<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.180> mod<00:03:42.390> off<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:43.170> really

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
reason not to get it the main argument

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.950 
reason not to get it the main argument
against<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.370> mod<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:38.120> everything<00:04:38.780> is

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
against the mod is that everything is

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.200 
against the mod is that everything is
configurable<00:04:39.650> in<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.950> in-game<00:04:40.610> settings

configurable in the in-game settings

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.240 
configurable in the in-game settings
like<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:42.020> could<00:04:42.170> change<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.530> opacity<00:04:42.860> of

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
like you could change the opacity of

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.420 
like you could change the opacity of
certain<00:04:44.060> UI<00:04:44.300> elements<00:04:45.080> but<00:04:45.590> immersive<00:04:46.100> UI

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
certain UI elements but immersive UI

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.780 
certain UI elements but immersive UI
makes<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:47.110> easier<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.310> change<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.460> opacity

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
makes it easier to change the opacity

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.520 
makes it easier to change the opacity
without<00:04:50.390> having<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.870> go<00:04:50.990> into<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.350> settings
