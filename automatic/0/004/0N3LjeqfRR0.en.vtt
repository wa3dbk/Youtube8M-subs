00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
try to do as many as possible it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.810 
try to do as many as possible it's
difficult<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.680> us<00:01:01.890> since<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.430> live<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.640> far

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
difficult for us since we live so far

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780 
difficult for us since we live so far
away<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.280> center<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
away from from from this center of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.719 
away from from from this center of
ballroom<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.960> Europe<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.490> for<00:01:08.490> us<00:01:08.549> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
ballroom from Europe and for us it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
ballroom from Europe and for us it's
expensive<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.360> start<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.990> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
expensive to start with and it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080 
expensive to start with and it's
difficult<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.010> jet<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> takes<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
difficult to jet like it takes a lot of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.399 
difficult to jet like it takes a lot of
time<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.540> we'll<00:01:12.630> try<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.140> many<00:01:13.260> as

mean<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.780> where<00:01:28.409> we

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
mean it's it's different it's where we

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
mean it's it's different it's where we
test<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.369> rules<00:01:29.640> where<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.600> test<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.020> new

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this rule new is always better it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
this rule new is always better it's
always<00:01:41.250> work<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.820> progress<00:01:42.090> always<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.110> to
