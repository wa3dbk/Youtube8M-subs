00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
they actually don't what they actually

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.940 
they actually don't what they actually
do<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.560> uh<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.930> hit<00:01:22.080> detection<00:01:22.200> boxes<00:01:22.860> have

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
didn't and it made it seem like you had

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.679 
didn't and it made it seem like you had
a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.140> more<00:01:31.170> help<00:01:31.850> because<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
a lot more help because you some the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.819 
a lot more help because you some the
bullets<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.170> hit<00:01:34.380> didn't<00:01:34.710> actually

count<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:36.090> makes<00:01:36.270> sense<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:38.299> when<00:01:39.299> you're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
count that makes sense and when you're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
count that makes sense and when you're
Rex<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> targets<00:01:40.619> actually<00:01:40.890> running<00:01:41.130> a

modern warfare 2 as well it's more of
like<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.250> u-shaped<00:05:17.850> boat<00:05:18.090> where<00:05:18.390> in<00:05:18.540> cod4<00:05:19.250> it's

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
like a u-shaped boat where in cod4 it's

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.980 
like a u-shaped boat where in cod4 it's
like<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.430> rectangle<00:05:20.760> line<00:05:21.270> down<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.600> center<00:05:21.720> of

like a rectangle line down the center of
the<00:05:22.110> body<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.430> hitbox<00:05:23.760> is<00:05:23.910> considerably

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
the body so the hitbox is considerably

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.470 
the body so the hitbox is considerably
