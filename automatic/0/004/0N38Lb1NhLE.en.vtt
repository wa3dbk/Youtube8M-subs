00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I mean I guess you've had a bit of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.179 
I mean I guess you've had a bit of
practice<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.020> Darin<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.680> Hollyoaks<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.130> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
practice with Darin in Hollyoaks but it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.849 
practice with Darin in Hollyoaks but it
was<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> good<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.969> do<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.719> role<00:01:51.960> play<00:01:52.320> yes

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
was it good to do that role play yes

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.170 
was it good to do that role play yes
it's<00:01:53.130> lovely<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> take<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> character

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's lovely to take on a character

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.440 
it's lovely to take on a character
because<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.979> lets<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> forget<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
because it lets you forget about you so

because it lets you forget about you so
you<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.750> you're<00:01:57.899> someone<00:01:58.049> else<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.530> that

you think you're someone else and that
sort<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.859> takes<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.219> distracts<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.820> from

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
sort of takes it distracts you from

sort of takes it distracts you from
actually<00:02:00.570> what's<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.140> yeah<00:02:01.619> that's
