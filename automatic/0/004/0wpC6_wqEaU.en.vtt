from<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.210> puppy's<00:00:24.539> nose<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.050> between<00:00:25.470> those

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
from the puppy's nose in between those

from the puppy's nose in between those
two<00:00:25.920> front<00:00:26.250> feet<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.359> want<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.750> really

stand back up yes good puppy

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
stand back up yes good puppy
once<00:00:35.040> we've<00:00:35.280> drawn<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.880> line<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> nose

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
once we've drawn that line from the nose

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.990 
once we've drawn that line from the nose
directly<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:37.980> between<00:00:38.370> those<00:00:38.520> two<00:00:38.730> front

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
directly down between those two front

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
directly down between those two front
feet<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> keep<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.500> hand<00:00:40.800> there

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
feet you want to keep your hand there

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
feet you want to keep your hand there
this<00:00:41.879> way<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.300> puppy<00:00:42.540> won't<00:00:42.629> quickly<00:00:43.050> pop

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this way your puppy won't quickly pop

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.479 
this way your puppy won't quickly pop
back<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.530> into<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.160> sit<00:00:44.430> position<00:00:46.489> sometimes

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
back up into a sit position sometimes

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.010 
back up into a sit position sometimes
it's<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> little<00:00:48.210> bit<00:00:48.300> tricky<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.870> our

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's a little bit tricky to get our

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.630 
it's a little bit tricky to get our
puppies<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> lay<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.280> drop<00:00:50.520> position

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
puppies into a lay down or drop position

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
puppies into a lay down or drop position
so<00:00:51.449> there's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> couple<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.170> different

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
so there's a couple of different

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.979 
so there's a couple of different
techniques<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.300> direct

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
techniques that we can do the direct

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.020 
techniques that we can do the direct
line<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.320> nose<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.129> between<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.610> two<00:00:56.820> front

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
line from nose in between the two front

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.299 
line from nose in between the two front
feet<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> first<00:00:57.840> technique<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.949> second

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
feet is the first technique the second

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
feet is the first technique the second
way<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> slowly<00:01:00.930> once<00:01:01.289> again

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
way we can do it is to slowly once again

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
way we can do it is to slowly once again
go<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> nose<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.789> between<00:01:03.120> those<00:01:03.300> two

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
go from the nose in between those two

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.230 
go from the nose in between those two
front<00:01:03.780> feet<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.309> l-shape<00:01:05.880> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
front feet and then like an l-shape just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.960 
front feet and then like an l-shape just
very<00:01:06.479> slowly<00:01:06.840> start<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> drag<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.010> towards

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
very slowly start to drag it out towards

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.469 
very slowly start to drag it out towards
the<00:01:09.119> front<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> them<00:01:10.580> yes<00:01:11.580> good<00:01:11.909> boy<00:01:14.450> now<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the front of them yes good boy now you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.240 
the front of them yes good boy now you
notice<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.080> haven't<00:01:16.350> said<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> word<00:01:16.950> drop

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
notice that I haven't said the word drop

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
notice that I haven't said the word drop
or<00:01:17.490> lay<00:01:17.670> down<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.270> once<00:01:18.540> again<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.080> because

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
or lay down and once again it's because

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
or lay down and once again it's because
they<00:01:19.590> haven't<00:01:19.890> actually<00:01:20.460> understood<00:01:21.150> what

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
they haven't actually understood what

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.690 
they haven't actually understood what
I'm<00:01:21.509> asking<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.409> yet<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.520> want

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
I'm asking them to do as yet so we want

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
I'm asking them to do as yet so we want
to<00:01:24.030> lure<00:01:24.210> them<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> position<00:01:24.960> first<00:01:25.530> up

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to lure them into the position first up

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
to lure them into the position first up
and<00:01:26.040> once<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> chest<00:01:26.759> hits<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> floor

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and once that chest hits the floor

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
and once that chest hits the floor
that's<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.470> say<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> word<00:01:28.920> drop<00:01:29.250> or

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
that's when we can say the word drop or

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
that's when we can say the word drop or
leg<00:01:30.920> drop<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.280> puppy<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.680> really

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
leg drop good puppy so it's really

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
leg drop good puppy so it's really
important<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.030> decide<00:01:36.869> what

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
important that we actually decide what

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.569 
important that we actually decide what
word<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.770> before<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.340> start

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
word we want to use before we start

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.960 
word we want to use before we start
training<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.530> Q<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.070> reason<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.700> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
training is Q the reason for that is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
training is Q the reason for that is
because<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> say<00:01:42.810> drop<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.320> more<00:01:43.439> than

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
because we can say drop for more than

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
because we can say drop for more than
one<00:01:43.740> thing<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.460> say<00:01:44.610> drop<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:45.119> drop<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
one thing we can say drop or drop the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.179 
one thing we can say drop or drop the
ball<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:46.350> drop<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.829> drop<00:01:46.860> down

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
ball or we can say drop for drop down

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.399 
ball or we can say drop for drop down
onto<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.490> chest<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> family<00:01:49.079> need

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
onto your chest so you as a family need

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.960

to decide what you're actually going to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
to decide what you're actually going to
ask<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.420> puppy<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.680> drop<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> drop

the ball or is it drop to get down onto
the<00:01:55.200> chest<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> decide<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.909> dropped<00:01:57.240> for

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the chest if you decide it's dropped for

the chest if you decide it's dropped for
drop<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> ball<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> change<00:01:59.340> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
Q word here it can be laid or down or

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.320 
Q word here it can be laid or down or
anything<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.350> like

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.280 

once<00:02:12.330> they're<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.690> drop<00:02:12.870> position

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
once they're in a drop position

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.720 
once they're in a drop position
sometimes<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.159> bit<00:02:14.370> tricky<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
sometimes it is a little bit tricky to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.119 
sometimes it is a little bit tricky to
get<00:02:14.879> them<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.209> as<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.599> which<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.080> fine<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
get them up as well which is fine so to

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.500 
get them up as well which is fine so to
do<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.549> we<00:02:17.700> need<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.330> actually

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
do that all we need to do is actually

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.229 
do that all we need to do is actually
teach<00:02:18.930> them<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.230> stand<00:02:19.530> position<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.970> get

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
teach them a stand position so to get

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.820 
teach them a stand position so to get
them<00:02:21.390> into<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.690> stand<00:02:21.989> position<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> draw<00:02:22.799> a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
them into a stand position you draw a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.670 
them into a stand position you draw a
line<00:02:23.069> directly<00:02:23.700> from<00:02:23.879> their<00:02:24.120> nose<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.750> up<00:02:25.470> on

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
line directly from their nose and up on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:36.699 
line directly from their nose and up on
a<00:02:25.709> 45<00:02:26.370> degree<00:02:26.549> angle<00:02:32.750> yes<00:02:33.750> good<00:02:34.079> puppy<00:02:34.579> and

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
a 45 degree angle yes good puppy and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.960 
a 45 degree angle yes good puppy and
then<00:02:37.709> once<00:02:37.890> they're<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.280> standing

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
then once they're in that standing

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.880 
then once they're in that standing
position<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.840> draw<00:02:40.079> them<00:02:40.290> into<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> sit

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
position you can draw them into the sit

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.940 
position you can draw them into the sit
yes<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.629> once<00:02:42.900> again<00:02:43.109> directly<00:02:43.799> between

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
yes and then once again directly between

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.390 
yes and then once again directly between
those<00:02:44.310> two<00:02:44.579> front<00:02:44.879> feet<00:02:45.349> drop<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:47.220> you'll

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
those two front feet drop so you'll

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.740 
those two front feet drop so you'll
notice<00:02:47.579> that<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.819> didn't<00:02:48.120> actually<00:02:48.239> say<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
notice that I didn't actually say the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.990 
notice that I didn't actually say the
word<00:02:48.930> drop<00:02:49.200> into<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.560> chest<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.250> completely

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
word drop into that chest was completely

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.479 
word drop into that chest was completely
on<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.269> floor<00:02:51.569> sometimes<00:02:52.260> they<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.859> trick<00:02:53.340> us

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
on the floor sometimes they can trick us

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.280 
on the floor sometimes they can trick us
with<00:02:53.519> their<00:02:53.909> drop<00:02:54.090> position<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.690> they'll<00:02:55.140> be

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
with their drop position and they'll be

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.440 
with their drop position and they'll be
in<00:02:55.409> more<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.859> bow<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.760> bottom<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.420> be

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
in more like a bow so that bottom can be

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.599 
in more like a bow so that bottom can be
slightly<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:58.140> off<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> floor<00:02:58.620> or<00:02:58.980> they<00:02:59.430> can

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
slightly up off the floor or they can

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.699 
slightly up off the floor or they can
have<00:02:59.849> their<00:03:00.060> elbows<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.690> quite<00:03:00.959> relaxed<00:03:01.500> onto

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
have their elbows not quite relaxed onto

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.559 
have their elbows not quite relaxed onto
the<00:03:01.799> floor<00:03:02.069> yet<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.909> really<00:03:03.060> important

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
the floor yet so it's really important

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.479 
the floor yet so it's really important
that<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.840> associate<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.799> word<00:03:05.040> drop<00:03:05.310> or

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
that you associate that word drop or

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.430 
that you associate that word drop or
down<00:03:05.700> when<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.120> chest<00:03:06.480> physically<00:03:07.049> hits<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
down when that chest physically hits the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.990 
down when that chest physically hits the
floor<00:03:07.650> good<00:03:08.400> puppy

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
floor good puppy

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.059 
floor good puppy
the<00:03:09.780> other<00:03:09.930> thing<00:03:10.170> you'll<00:03:10.319> notice<00:03:10.379> I'm<00:03:10.769> doing

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the other thing you'll notice I'm doing

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.949 
the other thing you'll notice I'm doing
is<00:03:11.190> whilst<00:03:11.430> he's<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.150> drop<00:03:12.329> position<00:03:12.510> I

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
is whilst he's in the drop position I

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.960 
is whilst he's in the drop position I
continue<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.650> treat<00:03:13.889> him<00:03:14.160> down<00:03:14.400> nice<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.669> low

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
continue to treat him down nice and low

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.390 
continue to treat him down nice and low
this<00:03:15.690> encourages<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> behavior<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:16.919> stay<00:03:17.250> on

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
this encourages the behavior to stay on

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.300 
this encourages the behavior to stay on
the<00:03:17.519> floor<00:03:17.669> and<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:19.560> how<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.799> teach<00:03:20.069> your

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
the floor and that's how you teach your

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.159 
the floor and that's how you teach your
puppy<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.760> go<00:03:20.880> into<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> drop<00:03:21.510> position<00:03:21.959> I'm
