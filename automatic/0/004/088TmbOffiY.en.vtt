duty ghosts has just been leaked out to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.990 
duty ghosts has just been leaked out to
the<00:00:08.610> internet<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:10.200> kind<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.679> crazy<00:00:11.340> now

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the internet and it's kind of crazy now

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.570 
the internet and it's kind of crazy now
the<00:00:12.509> source<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.590> first<00:00:14.160> saw<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the source of this I first saw and I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.910 
the source of this I first saw and I
thought<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.880> Photoshop<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.780> mean<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
thought it was Photoshop do you mean it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.939 
thought it was Photoshop do you mean it
just<00:00:17.130> looks<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.760> photoshopped<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.020> then<00:00:19.289> when

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
just looks so photoshopped but then when

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.390 
just looks so photoshopped but then when
all<00:00:20.400> goes<00:00:20.910> wrong<00:00:21.150> tesco<00:00:21.869> leaks<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> guess

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
all goes wrong tesco leaks it so I guess

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.370 
all goes wrong tesco leaks it so I guess
tesco<00:00:23.910> leaked<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.689> right<00:00:25.019> after<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
tesco leaked it and then right after I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439

some images that were advertising for
their<00:01:23.909> website<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:25.470> they<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.799> making

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
their website and when they were making

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.399 
their website and when they were making
the<00:01:26.640> adjustments<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.630> wasn't<00:01:27.990> actually

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the adjustments that it wasn't actually

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.590 
the adjustments that it wasn't actually
supposed<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.180> wasn't<00:01:30.479> supposed

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.770 
supposed to be on and it wasn't supposed
