up on some of the nuances of what makes

up on some of the nuances of what makes
soul<00:02:07.259> calibur<00:02:07.619> 3<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.160> different<00:02:08.610> than

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
soul calibur 3 a little different than

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.290 
soul calibur 3 a little different than
the<00:02:08.849> previous

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the previous

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
the previous
games<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:10.170> guard<00:02:10.410> impact<00:02:10.800> system<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
games the guard impact system is a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070 
games the guard impact system is a
little<00:02:11.610> different<00:02:11.940> than<00:02:12.060> before<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
little different than before and at the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.630 
little different than before and at the
same<00:02:13.230> time<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.650> easier<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.100> punish<00:02:14.400> players

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
same time it's easier to punish players

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.910 
same time it's easier to punish players
who<00:02:14.940> are<00:02:15.030> overly<00:02:15.420> hesitant<00:02:15.930> or<00:02:16.080> defensive<00:02:16.740> now

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
who are overly hesitant or defensive now

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280 
who are overly hesitant or defensive now
so<00:02:17.490> you've<00:02:17.850> got<00:02:18.030> things<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.480> walls<00:02:18.930> where

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so you've got things like walls where

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.530 
so you've got things like walls where
you<00:02:19.410> can<00:02:19.560> bash<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.670> player<00:02:20.850> against<00:02:21.240> them<00:02:21.390> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
you can bash the player against them and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.420 
you can bash the player against them and
continue<00:02:22.110> your<00:02:22.140> combo<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.310> also

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
continue your combo and you can also

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.310 
continue your combo and you can also
really<00:02:23.910> punish<00:02:24.450> someone<00:02:24.660> who<00:02:24.870> doesn't<00:02:25.170> pick

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
really punish someone who doesn't pick

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.020 
really punish someone who doesn't pick
himself<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.800> off<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.220> ground<00:02:26.340> after<00:02:26.670> getting

himself up off the ground after getting
knocked<00:02:27.060> down<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.810> thing<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> soul<00:02:28.770> calibur<00:02:28.800> 3

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
knocked down the thing is soul calibur 3

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.880 
knocked down the thing is soul calibur 3
is<00:02:29.610> definitely<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.240> case<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.720> deja<00:02:31.140> vu<00:02:31.350> all<00:02:31.590> over

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
is definitely a case of deja vu all over

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.530 
is definitely a case of deja vu all over
again<00:02:31.920> despite<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> lot<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> changes

again despite a lot of the changes
that's<00:02:34.170> partly<00:02:34.500> because<00:02:34.710> you'll<00:02:35.070> be<00:02:35.130> looking

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that's partly because you'll be looking

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
that's partly because you'll be looking
at<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> lot<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> same<00:02:36.360> recycled<00:02:36.990> animations

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
at a lot of the same recycled animations

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.930 
at a lot of the same recycled animations
that<00:02:37.710> you've<00:02:37.830> been<00:02:37.980> seeing<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.310> years<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that you've been seeing for years and

that you've been seeing for years and
years<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.080> combat<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.710> doesn't

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
years now and the combat just doesn't

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.760 
years now and the combat just doesn't
have<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.460> same<00:02:41.690> move<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> used<00:02:43.650> to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
have the same move to it as it used to

have the same move to it as it used to
it<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.220> doesn't<00:02:44.460> pack<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.240> same<00:02:45.480> wallop<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.050> as

it it doesn't pack the same wallop as as

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.200 
it it doesn't pack the same wallop as as
maybe<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.710> remember<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.340> playing<00:02:47.610> soul

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
maybe you remember from playing soul

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.690 
maybe you remember from playing soul
calibur<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> past<00:02:49.050> none<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.950> these<00:02:50.130> bladed

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.170 
weapons still draw blood or anything
like<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.310> action<00:02:53.640> itself<00:02:53.730> feels

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
like that so the action itself feels

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360 
like that so the action itself feels
fairly<00:02:54.600> tame<00:02:55.020> it's<00:02:55.620> not<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:55.980> changing

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
fairly tame it's not like changing

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.040 
fairly tame it's not like changing
around<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> animations<00:02:57.270> just<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.840> sake

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
around the animations just for the sake

around the animations just for the sake
of<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.290> would<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.440> made<00:02:58.680> soul<00:02:58.950> calibur<00:02:59.340> 3<00:02:59.580> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
of it would have made soul calibur 3 a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.580 
of it would have made soul calibur 3 a
better<00:02:59.850> game<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.420> still<00:03:00.690> if<00:03:01.200> you've<00:03:01.380> been

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
better game but still if you've been

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.200 
better game but still if you've been

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
that some of this stuff looked a little

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
fighting games around but that's partly

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.670

because<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.570> lot<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:27.810> its<00:05:28.020> competition<00:05:28.440> is

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
because a lot of its competition is

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.190
