00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.072
 What is money? 

00:00:02.097 --> 00:00:04.173
 We all use money 

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:05.853
 We need to buy things 

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:07.856
 We work hard to get it 

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:10.547
 And provide it for retirement, or for a rainy day, 

00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:12.923
 We all rely on money 

00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:16.186
 So why not know how money works? 

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:18.352
 Why is there sometimes a lot of it? 

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.274
 Which makes us believe that happy times will never end? 

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:23.960
 Where does all this money come from? 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.769
 Why suddenly there is not enough money? 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.817
 Why do people struggle to pay their bills? 

00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:33.003
 Where does all this money go? 

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:39.376
 The surprising fact is that the majority of money in the UK is made up of banks. 

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:43.159
 As a magician, banks make money appear, 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.516
 Almost of nothing 

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:46.403
 When they give loans. 

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:48.969
 But that money is not what it seems. 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.780
 This money is a credit 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.101
 It is a temporary loan from banks. 

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.493
 We use it as money. 

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:57.671
 We believe it is money. 

00:00:57.671 --> 00:00:59.470
 But because they are credit, 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.998
 At some point in the future you have to pay back. 

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:04.801
 When they recover they disappear, 

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.834
 This is not a hoax. 

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.506
 This is not a hoax. 

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:13.019
 This is almost the way that our money is made and destroyed. 

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:16.842
 So to what extent these banks are trustworthy, 

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.704
 On which we depend entirely? 

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:23.202
 Well, banks make profits by clarifying interest on loans. 

00:01:23.202 --> 00:01:25.478
 As much as they trust the economy, 

00:01:25.478 --> 00:01:28.405
 They will lend money as much as they can, 

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:32.486
 More loans and more real estate bets, means making more of the dead 

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:36.114
 At lightning speed 

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:38.951
 Real estate prices rise to the sky 

00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.070
 But if there is a lot of money, the debt burden will be huge 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.320
 So people will not be able to respond 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.364
 Banks stop lending 

00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:48.326
 Suddenly there is not enough money 

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:50.095
 And bankrupt business, 

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:53.243
 People lose their jobs and home ownership is restored. 

00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:56.998
 This is what caused the financial crisis. 

00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:59.736
 Since then, nothing has changed radically. 

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:03.047
 Money is still made by banks. 

00:02:03.047 --> 00:02:06.719
 And disappears when debt has been paid. 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.089
 Until we change this, 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.319
 We will not have a stable economy, 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.553
 Stable functions 

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:15.161
 Affordable accommodation 

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:18.155
 But it does not have to be that way 

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:20.583
 "Positive Money" is a campaign to change the way money is made 

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:22.735
 We need you to share. 

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:31.901
