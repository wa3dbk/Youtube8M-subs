00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
so serious problems that need addressing

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.510 
so serious problems that need addressing
yeah<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.380> well<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:36.650> would<00:00:36.770> say<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:36.950> everyone

yeah so well you would say that everyone

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.460 
yeah so well you would say that everyone
even<00:00:37.910> if<00:00:38.000> they<00:00:38.090> are<00:00:38.210> northern<00:00:38.510> European<00:00:39.110> like

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
even if they are northern European like

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.590 
even if they are northern European like
like<00:00:39.770> we<00:00:39.950> are<00:00:40.100> get<00:00:40.670> yourself<00:00:41.000> checked<00:00:41.360> for

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
like we are get yourself checked for

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.330 
like we are get yourself checked for
skin<00:00:41.750> cancer<00:00:41.930> absolutely<00:00:42.710> if<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:42.920> can<00:00:43.190> get

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
skin cancer absolutely if you can get

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.160 
skin cancer absolutely if you can get
yourself<00:00:43.430> screened<00:00:44.000> get<00:00:44.240> yourself<00:00:44.600> screened

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.660 

so<00:00:48.170> Angela<00:00:48.530> what<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.860> screening<00:00:49.220> actually

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
so Angela what is the screening actually

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.490 
so Angela what is the screening actually
involved<00:00:50.180> well<00:00:50.630> we're<00:00:50.780> looking<00:00:50.870> for<00:00:51.260> skin

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
involved well we're looking for skin

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.130 
involved well we're looking for skin
cancer<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.150> Machine<00:00:53.480> we're<00:00:53.660> using<00:00:53.870> is

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
cancer and the Machine we're using is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.470 
cancer and the Machine we're using is
called<00:00:54.380> a<00:00:54.470> size<00:00:54.710> scope<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.970> an<00:00:56.120> infrared

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
called a size scope and it's an infrared

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.510 
called a size scope and it's an infrared
light<00:00:56.870> that<00:00:57.500> allows<00:00:57.740> us<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:58.010> see<00:00:58.280> two

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
light that allows us to see two

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.010 
light that allows us to see two
millimeters<00:00:59.090> down<00:00:59.240> below<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.600> surface<00:00:59.630> of

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
millimeters down below the surface of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.470 
millimeters down below the surface of
the<00:01:00.080> skin<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.400> very<00:01:01.610> sensitive<00:01:02.060> way<00:01:02.330> of

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
the skin so it's a very sensitive way of

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.630 
the skin so it's a very sensitive way of
examining<00:01:03.140> what's<00:01:03.320> going<00:01:03.620> on<00:01:03.740> underneath<00:01:03.980> mmm

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
examining what's going on underneath mmm

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.340 
examining what's going on underneath mmm
there's<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.939> hunt<00:01:05.150> no<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.020> non-invasive

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's a hunt no it's a non-invasive

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.010 
there's a hunt no it's a non-invasive
procedure<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.729> if<00:01:08.479> you've<00:01:08.600> got<00:01:08.749> something

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
procedure and if you've got something

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.959 
procedure and if you've got something
for<00:01:09.320> me<00:01:09.469> to<00:01:09.649> do<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:10.009> give<00:01:10.189> or<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.490> a<00:01:10.520> look<00:01:10.729> for

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
for me to do to give or have a look for

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.489 
for me to do to give or have a look for
you<00:01:11.179> and<00:01:11.359> I<00:01:11.390> just<00:01:11.600> need<00:01:11.749> to<00:01:11.869> spray<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.320> little

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
you and I just need to spray a little

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:13.510 
you and I just need to spray a little
bit<00:01:12.649> of<00:01:12.799> contact

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
bit of contact

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.510 
bit of contact
this<00:01:14.509> helps<00:01:14.929> to<00:01:15.079> reflect<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.590> light<00:01:15.799> into<00:01:16.399> the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
this helps to reflect the light into the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.410 
this helps to reflect the light into the
Machine<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.829> hopefully<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:20.060> won't<00:01:20.179> notice

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
Machine and hopefully you won't notice

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.739 
Machine and hopefully you won't notice
that<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.840> hat<00:01:21.640> gently<00:01:22.640> place<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.630> I'm

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
that this hat gently place it on and I'm

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.300 
that this hat gently place it on and I'm
looking<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:24.109> see<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:24.679> roughly<00:01:24.979> in<00:01:25.219> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
looking to see that it's roughly in the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.849 
looking to see that it's roughly in the
middle<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.609> the<00:01:25.729> screen<00:01:26.289> and<00:01:27.289> pressing<00:01:27.649> my

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
middle of the screen and pressing my

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:34.340 
middle of the screen and pressing my
button<00:01:28.219> we<00:01:28.460> keep<00:01:28.670> still<00:01:28.999> takes<00:01:29.420> 3-4<00:01:29.689> seconds

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.679 

ready<00:01:35.729> doesn't<00:01:36.729> look<00:01:36.880> very<00:01:36.909> attractive<00:01:37.179> in

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
ready doesn't look very attractive in

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.090 
ready doesn't look very attractive in
the<00:01:37.810> screen<00:01:38.109> but<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.439> doesn't<00:01:38.950> necessarily

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
the screen but that doesn't necessarily

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.980 
the screen but that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:39.579> that<00:01:39.609> it's<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.850> problem<00:01:40.179> does<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:40.359> no

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
mean that it's a problem does it no

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.929 
mean that it's a problem does it no
that's<00:01:41.350> right<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:41.890> here<00:01:42.100> we<00:01:42.219> are<00:01:42.250> making<00:01:42.610> quite

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
that's right so here we are making quite

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's right so here we are making quite
a<00:01:43.000> picture<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.990> mole<00:01:44.259> on<00:01:44.469> your<00:01:44.500> arm<00:01:44.829> and

the next picture down is the amount of

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.520 
the next picture down is the amount of
melanin<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:48.969> melanocytes<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:50.079> give<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.350> its

remotely<00:01:57.850> sinister<00:01:58.539> I'd<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.170> see

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
remotely sinister I'd have to see

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.020 
remotely sinister I'd have to see
something<00:01:59.829> in<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.130> screen<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.670> as<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:00.880> can

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
something in that screen and as you can

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.609 
something in that screen and as you can
see<00:02:01.090> that's<00:02:01.569> good<00:02:01.780> news<00:02:01.959> there's<00:02:02.289> nothing

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
see that's good news there's nothing

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.770 
see that's good news there's nothing
there<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:03.069> it<00:02:03.819> could<00:02:03.969> look<00:02:04.090> from<00:02:04.329> green<00:02:04.569> to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
there and it could look from green to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.510 
there and it could look from green to
blue<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:05.140> red<00:02:05.350> depending<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.950> how<00:02:06.130> far<00:02:06.369> it

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
blue to red depending on how far it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.259 
blue to red depending on how far it
dipped<00:02:06.759> down<00:02:07.030> into<00:02:07.959> the<00:02:08.049> next<00:02:08.319> layer<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.269> next

picture<00:02:10.569> down<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.200> blood<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:12.310> again<00:02:12.579> that

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
picture down is the blood and again that

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.789 
picture down is the blood and again that
looks<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.209> nice<00:02:13.390> healthy<00:02:13.720> blood<00:02:14.079> supply<00:02:14.440> for

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
looks a nice healthy blood supply for

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.640 
looks a nice healthy blood supply for
that<00:02:14.920> particular<00:02:15.190> mole<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.959> we<00:02:17.110> can<00:02:17.290> see<00:02:17.500> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
that particular mole and we can see the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.970 
that particular mole and we can see the
collagen<00:02:18.160> as<00:02:18.280> well<00:02:19.079> it's<00:02:20.079> very<00:02:20.230> clever<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
collagen as well it's very clever the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.199 
collagen as well it's very clever the
way<00:02:21.130> we<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.459> see<00:02:21.610> what's<00:02:21.819> going<00:02:21.910> on

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
way we can see what's going on

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.759 
way we can see what's going on
underneath<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:23.049> it's<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.290> straight<00:02:23.560> forward

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
underneath and it's a straight forward

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.559 
underneath and it's a straight forward
is<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.099> nothing<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.670> worry<00:02:24.849> about<00:02:24.880> at<00:02:25.209> least

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
is that nothing to worry about at least

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.910 
is that nothing to worry about at least
with<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.989> one<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.380> how<00:02:26.500> long<00:02:26.650> does<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.829> whole

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
with that one so how long does the whole

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.860 
with that one so how long does the whole
process<00:02:27.040> take<00:02:27.370> Angela<00:02:27.819> that's<00:02:28.120> as<00:02:28.299> long<00:02:28.480> we

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
process take Angela that's as long we

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.319 
process take Angela that's as long we
can<00:02:29.140> generally<00:02:29.680> check<00:02:30.579> people<00:02:30.940> over<00:02:31.239> if

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
can generally check people over if

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.059 
can generally check people over if
you've<00:02:31.480> noticed<00:02:31.720> any<00:02:32.079> changes<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
you've noticed any changes that's the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.890 
you've noticed any changes that's the
biggest<00:02:33.280> thing<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.910> notice<00:02:34.060> changes<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
biggest thing if you notice changes in a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.990 
biggest thing if you notice changes in a
mole<00:02:35.110> that's<00:02:35.349> important<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.879> will

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
mole that's important and they will

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960 
mole that's important and they will
obviously<00:02:37.120> screen<00:02:37.690> those<00:02:37.870> particular<00:02:38.200> moles

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
obviously screen those particular moles

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.759 
obviously screen those particular moles
and<00:02:39.970> places<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:41.019> back<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.560> can't

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
and places like your back so you can't

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.500 
and places like your back so you can't
always<00:02:41.980> see<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.549> again<00:02:42.760> we<00:02:42.910> check<00:02:43.090> your<00:02:43.299> backs

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
always see so again we check your backs

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.900 
always see so again we check your backs
for<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.290> if<00:02:44.920> you've<00:02:45.069> burnt<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.549> child

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
for you and if you've burnt as a child

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.370 
for you and if you've burnt as a child
all<00:02:46.150> these<00:02:46.359> things<00:02:46.630> we<00:02:46.840> go<00:02:46.989> through<00:02:47.260> an

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
all these things we go through an

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.069 
all these things we go through an
extensive<00:02:47.980> history<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.700> sit<00:02:49.569> down<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.959> talk

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
extensive history and sit down and talk

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.599 
extensive history and sit down and talk
to<00:02:50.139> you<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.010> whole<00:02:51.160> procedure<00:02:51.459> takes

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
to you so the whole procedure takes

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.610 
to you so the whole procedure takes
about<00:02:52.049> 20-25<00:02:53.049> minutes

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
about 20-25 minutes

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.309 
about 20-25 minutes
and<00:02:54.359> hopefully<00:02:55.359> we've<00:02:55.510> got<00:02:55.660> good<00:02:55.870> news<00:02:56.019> at<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
and hopefully we've got good news at the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.170 
and hopefully we've got good news at the
end<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:57.010> very<00:02:57.040> straightforward<00:02:57.549> everyone
