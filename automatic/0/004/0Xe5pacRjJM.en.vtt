00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
again and then you're going to cut it in

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.440 
again and then you're going to cut it in
half<00:01:54.130> again<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.880> you're<00:01:55.030> going<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.210> do<00:01:55.329> it

this way so that you have like little

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.209 
this way so that you have like little
triangles<00:01:59.219> when<00:02:00.219> you're<00:02:00.340> done<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.740> put<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
triangles when you're done now I put the

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.800 
triangles when you're done now I put the
rest<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.490> my<00:02:03.609> triangles<00:02:04.149> aside<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.600> now<00:02:04.659> what

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
rest of my triangles aside and now what

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.899 
rest of my triangles aside and now what
I'm<00:02:04.899> doing<00:02:05.170> with<00:02:05.319> my<00:02:05.469> hands<00:02:05.889> is<00:02:06.009> just<00:02:06.249> working

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
it so that you have the pointy side

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.919 
it so that you have the pointy side
right<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.459> center<00:02:09.819> now<00:02:10.390> here's<00:02:10.629> how<00:02:10.810> I'm

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
right in the center now here's how I'm

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.360 
right in the center now here's how I'm
going<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.080> do<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.319> you're<00:02:11.950> going<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.099> take

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370

okay just like that because these are
going<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:18.200> folded<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.650> anyway<00:02:19.060> tap<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.240> with

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
going to be folded in anyway tap it with

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.610 
going to be folded in anyway tap it with
your<00:02:20.390> piece<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> cheese<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:20.990> can<00:02:21.260> do<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> little

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
your piece of cheese you can do a little

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.200 
your piece of cheese you can do a little
extra<00:02:21.830> ham<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.310> cheese<00:02:22.490> if<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.700> want<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:23.120> you
