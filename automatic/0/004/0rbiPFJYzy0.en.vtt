00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.400 

I<00:01:06.170> got<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.890> idea<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.690> heat<00:01:08.690> domestic<00:01:09.230> hot

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410

water<00:01:10.330> from<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.450> message<00:01:11.960> board<00:01:12.230> food<00:01:12.410> river

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
water from the message board food river

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.430 
water from the message board food river
coils<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.420> thought<00:01:14.630> about<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.110> didn't

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
coils so what I thought about I didn't

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.620 
coils so what I thought about I didn't
want<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.680> drill<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.640> stove<00:01:16.940> put<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.390> coil

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
want to drill the stove put a coil

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.020 
want to drill the stove put a coil
inside<00:01:20.800> so<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:21.890> came<00:01:21.950> up<00:01:22.220> with<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:22.460> idea<00:01:22.640> by

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
inside so I came up with this idea by

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.090 
inside so I came up with this idea by
making<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.450> radiant<00:01:23.870> panel<00:01:24.470> on<00:01:24.620> the<00:01:24.710> side<00:01:24.920> of

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
making a radiant panel on the side of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.720 
making a radiant panel on the side of
the<00:01:25.160> stove<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:26.510> transferring<00:01:27.320> heat<00:01:27.830> over<00:01:28.040> for

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
the stove and transferring heat over for

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.640 
the stove and transferring heat over for
domestic<00:01:29.180> water<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.780> think<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> first<00:01:30.590> step

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
domestic water I think the first step

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.810 
domestic water I think the first step
was<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.040> locate<00:01:32.620> water<00:01:33.620> heater<00:01:33.890> which<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.580> found

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
was to locate water heater which I found

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.270 
was to locate water heater which I found
on<00:01:34.940> Craigslist<00:01:34.970> within<00:01:35.810> six<00:01:36.080> hours

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
on Craigslist within six hours

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.060 
on Craigslist within six hours
it's<00:01:37.760> just<00:01:37.940> electric<00:01:38.450> heating<00:01:38.870> gallon<00:01:39.229> water

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
it's just electric heating gallon water

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.670 
it's just electric heating gallon water
here<00:01:40.400> you're<00:01:41.300> special

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.240 

they<00:01:45.010> will<00:01:45.250> start<00:01:45.670> probably<00:01:46.330> we<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.950> start

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
they will start probably we will start

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.660 
they will start probably we will start
with<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> points<00:01:49.060> like<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.330> apparent<00:01:49.750> loss

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
with the points like the apparent loss

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.289 
with the points like the apparent loss
we're<00:01:52.210> gonna<00:01:52.300> try<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.630> do<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.080> one<00:01:53.260> take

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.700 

if<00:01:56.630> my<00:01:56.979> wife<00:01:57.979> comes<00:01:58.250> over<00:01:58.520> here

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
if my wife comes over here

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:08.410 
if my wife comes over here
show<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.340> what's<00:02:00.580> underneath<00:02:00.850> here

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.199 

I<00:02:08.479> made<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.289> little<00:02:09.470> heat<00:02:09.800> shield<00:02:10.130> from<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
I made this little heat shield from the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:21.479 
I made this little heat shield from the
existing<00:02:11.870> baseboard<00:02:12.830> heat<00:02:16.030> slight<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.209> over

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.050 

we<00:02:22.489> have<00:02:22.810> three<00:02:23.810> rows<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> fin<00:02:24.530> tube

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
we have three rows of fin tube

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.350 
we have three rows of fin tube
three-quarter<00:02:26.060> inch<00:02:26.239> three<00:02:26.660> feet<00:02:26.870> long<00:02:28.360> bunch

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
three-quarter inch three feet long bunch

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.100 
three-quarter inch three feet long bunch
of<00:02:29.480> brass<00:02:29.630> T's<00:02:29.930> held<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:30.830> by<00:02:31.010> some<00:02:31.250> 95<00:02:31.520> pound

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
of brass T's held on by some 95 pound

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.509 
of brass T's held on by some 95 pound
magnets<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.650> basically<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.160> could<00:02:34.250> almost

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
magnets so basically you could almost

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.300 
magnets so basically you could almost
pull<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:34.819> right<00:02:34.970> off<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.420> wanted<00:02:35.660> to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
pull this right off if you wanted to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.040 
pull this right off if you wanted to
temperature<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.430> pressure<00:02:37.610> valve<00:02:37.910> yes<00:02:38.870> I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
temperature and pressure valve yes I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.710 
temperature and pressure valve yes I
still<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.500> plumb<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> bottom

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
still have to plumb that to the bottom

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.030 
still have to plumb that to the bottom
down<00:02:41.720> here<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.230> quick<00:02:42.800> green<00:02:44.709> what<00:02:45.709> holds

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
down here we have quick green what holds

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.430 
down here we have quick green what holds

here<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:42.320> if<00:04:42.440> we<00:04:42.560> look<00:04:42.710> at<00:04:42.770> our<00:04:42.889> supply<00:04:43.280> and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
here and if we look at our supply and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.170 
here and if we look at our supply and
return<00:04:43.550> temperatures<00:04:45.070> we<00:04:46.070> know<00:04:46.789> we<00:04:46.910> can<00:04:47.030> get<00:04:47.120> a

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
return temperatures we know we can get a

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.010 
return temperatures we know we can get a
shot<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:47.479> that<00:04:47.840> or<00:04:47.960> not

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
shot on that or not

shot on that or not
we're<00:04:50.560> supplying<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.130> coil<00:04:51.370> with<00:04:51.580> 110<00:04:52.150> and

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
we're supplying the coil with 110 and

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.470 
we're supplying the coil with 110 and
1/2<00:04:52.510> degrees<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.860> we're<00:04:54.040> returning<00:04:54.420> at<00:04:55.420> a

1/2 degrees and we're returning at a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.540 
1/2 degrees and we're returning at a
hundred<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:55.870> twelve<00:04:56.140> point<00:04:56.500> eight<00:04:56.650> I've

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
hundred and twelve point eight I've

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.460 
hundred and twelve point eight I've
tried<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:58.000> both<00:04:58.360> with<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.810> heat<00:04:58.990> shield<00:04:59.320> on

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
tried it both with the heat shield on

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.110 
tried it both with the heat shield on
and<00:04:59.650> off<00:04:59.770> to<00:04:59.950> see<00:05:00.130> what<00:05:00.160> my<00:05:00.400> differential<00:05:00.820> is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
and off to see what my differential is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.570 
and off to see what my differential is
and<00:05:01.450> it<00:05:02.260> really<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.650> get<00:05:02.860> about<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.190> same<00:05:03.220> maybe

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
and it really I get about the same maybe

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
and it really I get about the same maybe
2/10<00:05:04.180> difference<00:05:04.600> with<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.200> shield<00:05:05.800> on

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
2/10 difference with the shield on

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.120 
2/10 difference with the shield on
versus<00:05:07.600> off<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.470> next<00:05:08.680> thing<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:08.950> play

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
versus off and the next thing is to play

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
versus off and the next thing is to play
around<00:05:09.310> with<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.550> flow

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
around with the flow
