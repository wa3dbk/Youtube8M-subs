we're comparing scottish money in
England<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.560> Canadian<00:01:58.979> money<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> America<00:01:59.759> and

England to Canadian money in America and
that<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> case<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that is not really the case because you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.950 
that is not really the case because you
see<00:02:01.649> Canadian<00:02:02.640> money's<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.030> legal<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> US

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

see Canadian money's not legal in the US
at<00:02:04.320> least<00:02:04.619> most<00:02:04.950> places<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.060> Washington<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
at least most places not in Washington I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.559 
at least most places not in Washington I
know<00:02:07.160> but<00:02:08.160> yeah<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> big<00:02:09.450> difference

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
