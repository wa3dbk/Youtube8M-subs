00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.910
 on youtube here with another video of how 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.650
 start the dlc and gardens karting already 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.250
 that many have had problems for 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.140
 start the dl sets so we go for 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.109
 see how they can start playing 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.960
 go to one of the main cities of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.960
 here I went to white ground 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.190
 the guards this work fight 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.190
 against them 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.199
 after all this happens in the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.019
 fight to kill all the extras 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.469
 find this guy who is going to say that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.469
 if you want 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.970
 and because he ends up talking to know what 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.820
 already started the dlc and started the qwest and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.820
 now if it's going to mark you 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.060

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.350
 ready to play and on the map you already 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.350
 mark the place and here we go 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.180
 until 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.790
 to every 100 that you already see marked there is 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.210
 the place where you will start playing your 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.130
 tlc 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.950
 the second option is higher at level 10 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.860
 tables with any of the guards 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:56.870
 who are recruiting 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.870

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.130
 you will also see on the map 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.150

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.209
 and if for some time it does not mark you 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.780
 none of the three of the two times you 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.330
