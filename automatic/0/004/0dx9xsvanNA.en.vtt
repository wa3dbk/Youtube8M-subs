select<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.319> case<00:01:22.560> we're<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.219> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
select in this case we're going to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.139 
select in this case we're going to
select<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.619> check<00:01:25.619> mark<00:01:25.889> which<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.850> true

select the check mark which is the true

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.399 
select the check mark which is the true
condition<00:01:28.579> ok<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.639> while<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.990> true

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
condition ok so while that's true

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.489 
condition ok so while that's true
everything<00:01:32.249> that's<00:01:32.429> inside<00:01:32.789> between<00:01:33.499> here

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
everything that's inside between here

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.389 
everything that's inside between here
and<00:01:34.789> here<00:01:35.789> will<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.420> executed<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.979> next<00:01:38.189> we

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
and here will be executed so next we

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.719 
and here will be executed so next we
need<00:01:38.429> something<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.450> execute<00:01:39.569> and

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
need something for it to execute and

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.209 
need something for it to execute and
this<00:01:41.729> icon<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:44.119> state<00:01:45.119> change<00:01:45.780> icon<00:01:46.709> so

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
this icon is the state change icon so

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.609 
this icon is the state change icon so
we're<00:01:47.969> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> want<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> affect<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.350> little

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
we're going to want to affect the little

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
we're going to want to affect the little
LED<00:01:51.560> which<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.799> right<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.819> Arduino

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
LED which is right here on the Arduino

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.429 
LED which is right here on the Arduino
board<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:56.539> we'll<00:01:57.539> just<00:01:57.749> select<00:01:57.899> whichever

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
board and we'll just select whichever

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.949 
board and we'll just select whichever
pin<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.399> case<00:01:59.609> LED<00:02:00.209> is<00:02:00.299> pin<00:02:00.509> 13

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
pin we want in this case LED is pin 13

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.800 
pin we want in this case LED is pin 13
and<00:02:01.829> we're<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.819> to<00:02:02.850> set<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> value<00:02:03.479> for

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and we're going to set the value for

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
and we're going to set the value for
that<00:02:03.959> one<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.859> true<00:02:06.319> okay<00:02:07.319> but<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.920> need<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that one to true okay but we need to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
that one to true okay but we need to
know<00:02:08.280> how<00:02:08.459> long<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
know how long we want it to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.630 
know how long we want it to
be<00:02:11.530> energized<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.879> we<00:02:13.390> set<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.900> time<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:15.489> it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
be energized and so we set a time for it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.410 
be energized and so we set a time for it
and<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.269> do<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.569> we<00:02:17.349> enter<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:18.420> constant

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
and to do that we enter a constant

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.479 
and to do that we enter a constant
number<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:20.590> case<00:02:20.830> we're<00:02:21.129> going<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.280> set

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
number in this case we're going to set

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.710 
number in this case we're going to set
it<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.640> 500<00:02:24.540> okay

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it to 500 okay

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.100 
it to 500 okay
and<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> that'll<00:02:28.390> turn<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:31.420> 500

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and so that'll turn it on for for 500

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.720 
and so that'll turn it on for for 500
milliseconds<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:34.440> now<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.860> need<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.340> turn

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
milliseconds and now we need it to turn

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.259 
milliseconds and now we need it to turn
off

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
off

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.589 
off
and<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.170> again<00:02:38.410> we<00:02:38.620> select<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> pin<00:02:39.250> 13<00:02:39.730> and

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
and so we again we select the pin 13 and

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.080 
and so we again we select the pin 13 and
then<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:40.930> enter<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:44.280> false<00:02:45.280> statement<00:02:45.549> because

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
then we enter a false statement because

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.870 
then we enter a false statement because
now<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.480> want<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.019> go<00:02:47.170> off<00:02:47.349> on<00:02:47.590> its<00:02:48.280> true<00:02:48.610> off

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
now we want it to go off on its true off

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.460 
now we want it to go off on its true off
is<00:02:50.280> false<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:52.599> select<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.170> duration

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
is false and we select the duration

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.870 
is false and we select the duration
again<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.849> let's<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.329> make<00:02:58.690> things<00:02:58.959> simple

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
again and let's just make things simple

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.610 
again and let's just make things simple
have<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.030> blink<00:03:01.750> off<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.110> same<00:03:02.290> amount<00:03:02.560> of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
have it blink off the same amount of

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.750 
have it blink off the same amount of
time<00:03:02.829> that<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:06.250> Arduino

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
time that it's on so to get the Arduino

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.220 
time that it's on so to get the Arduino
I<00:03:07.000> love<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:07.870> programmed<00:03:08.380> into<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.739> Arduino

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I love this programmed into the Arduino

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.490 
I love this programmed into the Arduino
we<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.530> click<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.400> Run<00:03:13.000> button<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
we would click on the Run button and it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.870 
we would click on the Run button and it
will<00:03:14.620> load<00:03:14.799> all<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.069> this<00:03:15.280> stuff<00:03:15.579> into<00:03:15.760> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
will load all of this stuff into the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.690 
will load all of this stuff into the
Arduino<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.450> can<00:03:16.569> see<00:03:16.690> little<00:03:16.959> lights

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
Arduino you can see little lights

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.360 
Arduino you can see little lights
transmitting<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.790> receiving<00:03:18.819> you<00:03:19.269> can<00:03:19.420> see

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
transmitting and receiving you can see

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.949 
transmitting and receiving you can see
the<00:03:21.370> light<00:03:21.549> blinking<00:03:21.970> off<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.420> on<00:03:22.540> top<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.709> up

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
the light blinking off and on top it up

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.990 
the light blinking off and on top it up
now<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.019> can<00:03:26.200> vary<00:03:26.410> how<00:03:26.590> frequent<00:03:27.040> ly<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
now you can vary how frequent ly it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.050 
now you can vary how frequent ly it
comes<00:03:28.450> out<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.750> off<00:03:28.900> by<00:03:29.739> changing<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.670> value

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
comes out and off by changing the value

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.330 
comes out and off by changing the value
of<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.660> time<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.769> wanted<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.069> blink

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
of on time so if we wanted to blink

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.699 
of on time so if we wanted to blink
faster<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:33.910> put<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> smaller<00:03:34.420> amount<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.989> so

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
faster we put a smaller amount in so

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.340 
faster we put a smaller amount in so
we're<00:03:36.160> going<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.060> blink<00:03:37.329> at<00:03:37.690> 100

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
we're going to have it blink at 100

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.259 
we're going to have it blink at 100
we're<00:03:38.980> going<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.160> leave<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> 500<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:39.970> same

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
we're going to leave the 500 the same

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.770 
we're going to leave the 500 the same
for<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.049> off<00:03:41.380> time<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.889> we<00:03:42.819> load<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.420> in<00:03:43.540> run

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
for the off time and we load it in run

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.340 
for the off time and we load it in run
it<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:45.459> received<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.120> program<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.750> now<00:03:47.200> it's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
it it received the program and now it's

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.449 
it it received the program and now it's
blinking<00:03:48.269> for<00:03:49.269> shorter<00:03:49.600> duration<00:03:50.220> now<00:03:51.220> if<00:03:51.370> we

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
blinking for shorter duration now if we

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.120 
blinking for shorter duration now if we
want<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.910> blink<00:03:52.239> off<00:03:52.739> faster<00:03:53.739> as<00:03:53.889> well

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
want it to blink off faster as well

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.699 
want it to blink off faster as well
reduce<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.900> we're<00:03:56.170> going<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.319> put<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.620> a

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
reduce that so we're going to put it a

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.589 
reduce that so we're going to put it a
hundred

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
hundred

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.120 
hundred
now<00:03:58.599> both<00:03:58.840> it'll<00:03:59.230> be<00:03:59.319> on<00:03:59.470> for<00:03:59.980> 100

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
now both it'll be on for 100

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.069 
now both it'll be on for 100
milliseconds<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.060> off<00:04:01.150> 400<00:04:01.569> milliseconds

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
milliseconds and off 400 milliseconds

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.040 
milliseconds and off 400 milliseconds
we'll<00:04:02.260> program<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.799> again<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.819> run<00:04:04.060> key

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
we'll program it again the run key

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.440 
we'll program it again the run key
now<00:04:07.050> clinks<00:04:07.380> faster<00:04:10.790> we<00:04:11.790> want<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.150> blink

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
now clinks faster we want it to blink

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.230 
now clinks faster we want it to blink
slower<00:04:12.980> put<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.190> bigger<00:04:14.400> value<00:04:14.790> let's<00:04:15.000> go<00:04:15.150> up

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
slower put in a bigger value let's go up

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:23.350 
slower put in a bigger value let's go up
to<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.390> thousand<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:15.960> each<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:20.360> run<00:04:21.360> that<00:04:21.540> again

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
to a thousand in each and run that again

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.900 
to a thousand in each and run that again
programmed<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:26.100> it<00:04:26.940> blinks<00:04:27.360> much<00:04:28.140> slower<00:04:28.910> you

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
programmed and it blinks much slower you

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.400 
programmed and it blinks much slower you
don't<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.360> keep<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.660> two<00:04:30.810> values<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
don't have to keep the two values the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.900 
don't have to keep the two values the
same<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.710> could<00:04:31.950> have<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:33.320> coming<00:04:34.320> on<00:04:37.910> longer

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
same I could have it coming on longer

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.390 
same I could have it coming on longer
than<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.360> off<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:40.680> very<00:04:40.860> easy<00:04:41.070> just

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
than it is off it's very easy just

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.909 
than it is off it's very easy just
change<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.820> bottom<00:04:42.120> valued<00:04:43.250> reprogram

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.770 

and<00:04:48.400> there<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.639> see<00:04:48.849> it<00:04:48.879> looks<00:04:49.449> kind<00:04:49.719> of

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
and there you see it looks kind of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.850 
and there you see it looks kind of
irregularly<00:04:50.530> now<00:04:51.749> so<00:04:52.749> you<00:04:53.379> did<00:04:53.530> all<00:04:53.650> this

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
irregularly now so you did all this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.670 
irregularly now so you did all this
without<00:04:54.069> any<00:04:54.749> programming<00:04:55.749> code<00:04:56.289> but<00:04:56.469> if<00:04:56.560> you

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
without any programming code but if you

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.580 
without any programming code but if you
want<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.949> see<00:04:57.099> what<00:04:57.249> the<00:04:57.370> code<00:04:57.520> looks<00:04:57.580> like

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
want to see what the code looks like

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.119

you can click on View generate code and
it<00:05:03.819> shows<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.210> what<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.389> C<00:05:04.659> code<00:05:04.870> would<00:05:05.080> look

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
it shows you what the C code would look

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.659

which<00:05:28.419> is<00:05:28.599> what<00:05:29.879> the<00:05:30.879> designer<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.449> this<00:05:31.629> we

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
which is what the designer of this we

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.540 
which is what the designer of this we
and<00:05:32.529> the<00:05:33.009> Silva<00:05:33.400> created<00:05:35.039> so<00:05:36.039> each<00:05:36.189> program

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
and the Silva created so each program

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.709 
and the Silva created so each program
starts<00:05:37.379> with<00:05:38.379> a<00:05:38.409> setup<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:39.069> then<00:05:39.759> initializes

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
starts with a setup and then initializes

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.959 
starts with a setup and then initializes
the<00:05:40.750> board<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:42.099> says<00:05:42.279> while<00:05:42.460> it's<00:05:42.699> true

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
the board so it says while it's true

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.950 
the board so it says while it's true
then<00:05:43.330> it<00:05:43.479> sets<00:05:43.719> the<00:05:43.839> LED<00:05:44.319> this<00:05:44.949> part<00:05:45.749> turns<00:05:46.749> the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
then it sets the LED this part turns the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.409 
then it sets the LED this part turns the
LED<00:05:47.289> on<00:05:47.319> you<00:05:47.800> can<00:05:47.979> see<00:05:48.129> this<00:05:48.339> is<00:05:48.460> true<00:05:48.699> which

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
LED on you can see this is true which

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.719 
LED on you can see this is true which
would<00:05:49.689> correspond<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.979> true<00:05:54.219> and<00:05:54.400> that<00:05:54.430> would

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
would correspond the true and that would

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.270 
would correspond the true and that would
correspond<00:05:55.300> with<00:05:55.449> this

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.920 

the<00:06:00.150> while<00:06:00.390> here<00:06:00.810> above<00:06:01.170> it<00:06:02.810> correspond<00:06:03.810> with

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
the while here above it correspond with

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:15.589 
the while here above it correspond with
this<00:06:04.140> while<00:06:04.410> true<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:06.530> as<00:06:07.530> far<00:06:07.800> as<00:06:07.880> the

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:22.390 

let's<00:06:16.599> try<00:06:17.050> that<00:06:17.080> again

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.909 

as<00:06:22.669> far<00:06:23.150> as<00:06:23.180> this<00:06:23.449> code<00:06:23.750> is<00:06:23.900> concerned<00:06:24.350> where

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
as far as this code is concerned where

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.290 
as far as this code is concerned where
it<00:06:25.040> turns<00:06:25.250> off<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.550> LED<00:06:27.490> it's<00:06:28.490> false<00:06:28.790> it

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
it turns off the LED it's false it

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.930 
it turns off the LED it's false it
corresponds<00:06:29.840> to<00:06:29.930> this<00:06:30.110> block<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.580> here's<00:06:31.789> the

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
corresponds to this block and here's the

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.820 
corresponds to this block and here's the
delay<00:06:32.270> it's<00:06:32.660> 500<00:06:33.259> 500<00:06:34.009> here's<00:06:34.789> the<00:06:35.180> on<00:06:35.330> time

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
delay it's 500 500 here's the on time

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.770 
delay it's 500 500 here's the on time
1000<00:06:37.600> 1000<00:06:40.120> so<00:06:41.120> there<00:06:41.270> you<00:06:41.360> have<00:06:41.389> it

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
1000 1000 so there you have it

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.290 
1000 1000 so there you have it
mini<00:06:42.020> block<00:06:42.320> can<00:06:43.130> do<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.280> variety<00:06:43.759> of<00:06:44.090> things

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
mini block can do a variety of things

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.529 
mini block can do a variety of things
besides<00:06:44.690> just<00:06:44.990> turning<00:06:45.470> yeah<00:06:45.820> LED<00:06:46.820> on<00:06:47.150> and<00:06:47.210> off

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
besides just turning yeah LED on and off

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.490 
besides just turning yeah LED on and off
but<00:06:48.259> this<00:06:48.530> is<00:06:48.680> a<00:06:48.710> good<00:06:48.949> start<00:06:49.660> so<00:06:50.660> that's<00:06:51.080> mini

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
but this is a good start so that's mini

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.170 
but this is a good start so that's mini
block<00:06:52.600> mi<00:06:53.600> ni<00:06:53.930> BL<00:06:54.530> o<00:06:54.650> Q<00:06:55.100> and<00:06:55.570> this<00:06:56.570> is<00:06:56.780> version

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
block mi ni BL o Q and this is version

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.670 
block mi ni BL o Q and this is version
0.7<00:06:59.180> and<00:06:59.360> it's<00:06:59.660> an<00:06:59.750> alpha<00:07:00.020> version<00:07:00.169> the<00:07:00.470> beta

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
0.7 and it's an alpha version the beta

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.210 
0.7 and it's an alpha version the beta
version<00:07:01.130> should<00:07:01.460> be<00:07:01.520> out<00:07:01.729> shortly

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
version should be out shortly

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.420 
version should be out shortly
