00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.350

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.590

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.560
 we will do a fire test 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 so we see on this model the fires are 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.210
 have style had to play live so 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.630
 behind dual optical shutters of 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.630
 each side 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.799
 then 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.540
 here is the pretty 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.390
 very beautiful cars beautiful cars here 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.240

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.140
 will miss teen call that beautiful 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.140
 rims in 17 inches 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.379
 not elegant 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.640
 the very good we are going to do a 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.640
 little tour with 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.920
 not at all 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.520
 first thing I noticed in 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.090
 this car had come out of the garage 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.090
 impressive braking 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.470
 this is once again I repeat to the 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.970
 as soon as we accept as soon as we press 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.150
 the pedal where we feel right now 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.150
 hand brake 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.330
 we have an automatic gearbox on the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.330
 column 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.570
 here we go 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.960
 I think it works it works very 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.970
 well I feel good we are well 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.500
 the good interior there we saw on the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.560
 photos we will go on other photos is 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.740
 very very beautiful very clean very good 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.740
 state 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.610
 and here we go 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.590
 so here is the level seeing the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.960
 meters in one needle temperature 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.640
 ambient temperature works 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.090
 gas gauge too and of course 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.470
 the Ã‰guille 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.560
 the speedometer it works 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.560
 as well 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.530
 but it's a little bit 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.530
 a warm 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.810
 here 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.750
 not bad so 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.830
 although the accelerator 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.640
 I believe that with your is equipped with a 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.640
 chief quits because 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.419
 when I received eco recuperator tic 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.759
 in the car and well the future mo 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.970
 grady then felt it well to pass from 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.970
 speeds 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:54.650
 to confirm a little further then 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.920
 the very easy to drive very nice 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.689
 direction the direction is good all 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.669
 now if it is of course 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.270
 braking repeats very very effective 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.130
 unpleasant 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.630
 and we already see this little thing like 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.720
 it 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.430
 good road behavior that does not pull 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.060
 not right or left does not see them 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.060
 the easy to drive 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.900
 here 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.860
 this part 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.890
 it's good 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.890
 we have gone we are in the fourth 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.969
 household 60 in free form has its 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.019
 horror 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.249
 here on a small country road 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.249
 like that can post 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.060
 the thief is a problem 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.820
 it's ice cream 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.030
 so it's easy to drive 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.420
 with a finger like that I do not fight 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.720
 she remains well the right 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.720
 I was thinking 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.790
 Great 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.740
 r super 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.730
 torino 2070 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.730
 you see this moment 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.700
 that's what 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.700
 I like the kate door at the front 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.360
 put back forward of course 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.409
 good in the back 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.409
 sports cars 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.830
 it's a car without surprises 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.150
 this was a small 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.950
 ten road deaths a presentation of 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.969
 these two torino sets 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.259
 go 79 and 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.559
 again a gay car well 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.559
 friendly 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.840
 that's it and this is where the bio finished
