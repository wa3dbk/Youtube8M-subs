really but he was a quite a difficult
game<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.670> expected<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.780> difficulty<00:00:16.139> we

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
game and we expected in difficulty we

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.670 
game and we expected in difficulty we
expecting<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.430> expecting<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> difficult<00:00:18.240> game

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
expecting was expecting a difficult game

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.050 
expecting was expecting a difficult game
the<00:00:19.680> quality<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> pitch<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.820> quite

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the quality of the pitch was quite

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.599 
the quality of the pitch was quite
really<00:00:21.270> difficult<00:00:21.949> but<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> end<00:00:23.310> i<00:00:23.400> think

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
really difficult but in the end i think

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
really difficult but in the end i think
i<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.720> pleased<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.500> half

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
i was very pleased with the first half

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
i was very pleased with the first half
and<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.609> started<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> have

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and the way we started so going to have

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.880 
and the way we started so going to have
even<00:00:27.810> more<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:29.840> we<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.260> scored<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> first

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
even more and we we scored the first

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.030 
even more and we we scored the first
goals<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.489> he<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.120> ten<00:00:33.329> minutes<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> i

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
goals and he was ten minutes to go and i

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.319 
goals and he was ten minutes to go and i
was<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:36.170> hoping<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.149> home

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
was really hoping that we would go home

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.740 
was really hoping that we would go home
with<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> three<00:00:40.230> points<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.239> unlike<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> week<00:00:42.480> we

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
with a three points and unlike a week we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
with a three points and unlike a week we
give<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.649> goal<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
give them the the goal that that is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.000 
give them the the goal that that is
caught<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> end<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.860> look

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
caught but in the end i think if we look

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.920 
caught but in the end i think if we look
at<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.250> performance<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> 90<00:00:48.450> minutes<00:00:48.750> we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
at now performance for the 90 minutes we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.330 
at now performance for the 90 minutes we
really<00:00:49.860> control<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:51.059> game<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:52.199> had<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
really control the game we had the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
really control the game we had the
position<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> ball<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.710> some<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
position of the ball and some of the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.119 
position of the ball and some of the
play<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.719> we<00:00:57.719> did<00:00:57.870> today<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.980> good

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
play we we did today was was really good

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.040 
play we we did today was was really good
in<00:00:59.730> everyone<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.180> first<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.690> slip<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
in everyone at first was just slip in

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
in everyone at first was just slip in
slide<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.620> hard<00:01:02.070> time<00:01:02.219> about<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.489> change

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
slide and so hard time about to change

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
slide and so hard time about to change
dodson<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:03.960> better<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
dodson was a bit better what the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
dodson was a bit better what the
pictures<00:01:04.799> where<00:01:05.519> God<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.850> us<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.229> did

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
pictures where God for us at all did

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
pictures where God for us at all did
create<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> chances<00:01:08.340> particularly<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
create a lot of chances particularly in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
create a lot of chances particularly in
there<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> first<00:01:09.810> half<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> think

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
there in the first half do you think

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.100 
there in the first half do you think
maybe<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.310> could<00:01:11.570> have<00:01:12.570> taken<00:01:12.720> more<00:01:13.020> advantage

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
maybe I could have taken more advantage

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.530 
maybe I could have taken more advantage
of<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> time<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> first

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
of that at the time I think the first

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.940 
of that at the time I think the first
half<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> struggle<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
half which is struggle to get into it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
half which is struggle to get into it
but<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> mean<00:01:17.310> second<00:01:17.640> half<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.880> came<00:01:18.030> into<00:01:18.240> an

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
but I mean second half we came into an

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
but I mean second half we came into an
chances<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.290> decorated<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.799> better<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.159> what

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
chances we decorated it better with what

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.780 
chances we decorated it better with what
first<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> bit<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:22.200> times

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
first I was just a bit a bit at times

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.609 
first I was just a bit a bit at times
they<00:01:23.790> seem<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.330> quite<00:01:24.659> difficult<00:01:24.930> for

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
they seem to make it quite difficult for

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
they seem to make it quite difficult for
you<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> break<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> darn<00:01:26.430> high<00:01:26.640> tough<00:01:26.880> were<00:01:27.270> they

quality<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> players<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:41.030> remade

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
quality of the players we have remade

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
quality of the players we have remade
should<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.110> should<00:01:43.320> Scott<00:01:43.560> more<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.220> goals

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
should or should Scott more more goals

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
should or should Scott more more goals
but<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> game<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:45.990> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
but I think in the game what is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.870 
but I think in the game what is
important<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> create<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> chances<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
important is to create that chances and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.840 
important is to create that chances and
and<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.299> did<00:01:48.479> today<00:01:48.920> I'm<00:01:49.920> showing<00:01:50.220> another<00:01:50.670> day

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and we did today I'm showing another day

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960 
and we did today I'm showing another day
we<00:01:51.030> risk<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.259> goals<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.820> quite

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
we risk or more goals but it's quite

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
we risk or more goals but it's quite
important<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.630> losing<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> game<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.500> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
important not losing the game and we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700 
important not losing the game and we
