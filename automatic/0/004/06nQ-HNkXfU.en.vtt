 in fact create this number 2 we are going to 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.550
 make cup holders and portraits 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.980
 cardboard and glass or material mirrors 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.760

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.330
 mirror or vice 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.460
 a kind smile we started with the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.210
 creation of our cup holder by cutting 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.210
 our cardboard 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.560
 and then we make sure it's a figure 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.980
 round like the base of a can or a 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.980
 glass 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 that we have glass or mirror inside 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.620
 our towel and we use our 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.620
 hammer 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.180
 this results with several pieces of 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.300
 glass or mirror that we will use as 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.220
 decoration we use our gun 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.110
 silicone and we paste one by one of 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.110
 our pieces of glass or mirror 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.200
 and quickly we will have 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.420
 our cup holders 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.860
 for our strong portrait we use 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.860
 again our heart 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.110
 we bend them and cut the edges to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.110
 create the replacement holder 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.610
 i 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.910
 Y 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.099
 Now we use our photography to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.099
 highlight a frame 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.370
 yes 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.690
 we use our blade if the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.690
 space where the photograph will go 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.620
 we paste the piece of cardboard that we cut 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 previously 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.340
 and how can you see these things 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.590
 recyclables can be useful like this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.500
 cup holder this portrait I have 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.530
