00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the stitching is pretty unique as well

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.090 
the stitching is pretty unique as well
so<00:02:40.730> we've<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:41.630> kind<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.230> looked<00:02:42.620> at<00:02:42.800> some

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
so we've just kind of looked at some

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.590 
so we've just kind of looked at some
different<00:02:43.280> types<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.760> patterns<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.239> stitching

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
different types of patterns of stitching

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.199 
different types of patterns of stitching
to<00:02:44.810> allow<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.080> leather<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.920> maximized<00:02:46.610> you

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
to allow the leather to be maximized you

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.190 
to allow the leather to be maximized you
know<00:02:47.270> sometimes<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.720> /<00:02:47.930> stitch<00:02:48.110> a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
know sometimes you can / stitch a

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.990 
know sometimes you can / stitch a
product<00:02:48.590> takes<00:02:49.040> away<00:02:49.220> some<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.520> softness

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
product takes away some of the softness

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.610 
product takes away some of the softness
here<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.450> wanted<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> minimize<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.230> stitches

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
here we wanted to minimize the stitches

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.380 
here we wanted to minimize the stitches
so<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.430> we're<00:02:52.550> really<00:02:52.760> letting<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.180> leather

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
so that we're really letting the leather

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.630 
so that we're really letting the leather
be<00:02:53.750> premium<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.770> know<00:02:54.860> be<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.220> part<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
be premium you know be the part that the
