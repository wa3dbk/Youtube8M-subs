came up with by myself yeah yeah it took
me<00:00:17.310> forever<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:18.060> figure<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> these<00:00:18.630> out

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
me forever to figure some of these out

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.720 
me forever to figure some of these out
and<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.560> guess<00:00:19.740> first<00:00:19.980> off<00:00:20.190> I<00:00:20.369> would<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.670> be

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and I guess first off I would just be

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.020 
and I guess first off I would just be
showing<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.180> first<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.700> this<00:00:23.700> is<00:00:23.880> my

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
original one that I came up with it does

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.130 
original one that I came up with it does
not<00:00:28.080> work<00:00:28.290> very<00:00:28.350> well<00:00:28.590> did<00:00:28.710> ya<00:00:29.420> ya<00:00:30.420> ya<00:00:30.480> how<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
come in here you can see that it's got

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979 
come in here you can see that it's got
the<00:00:35.969> only<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.629> that<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> don't

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the only thing about it that I don't

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
the only thing about it that I don't
really<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.199> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.559> fact<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.219> red

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
really like is the fact that there's red

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.780 
really like is the fact that there's red
stone<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.810> can<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> shown<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.370> floor<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
stone that can be shown on the floor and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.810 
stone that can be shown on the floor and
on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> sides<00:00:42.500> yeah<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.920> yeah<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:44.760> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
on the sides yeah but yeah it's kind of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
on the sides yeah but yeah it's kind of
hard<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.060> overcome<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.860> possible

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
hard to overcome but it is possible

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.550 
hard to overcome but it is possible
which<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.120> did<00:00:48.300> yeah<00:00:48.810> I<00:00:48.840> figured<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.440> right

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
which I did yeah I figured it out right

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.560 
which I did yeah I figured it out right
here<00:00:49.800> yeah<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> figured<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
here yeah I figured over here but it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.630 
here yeah I figured over here but it
doesn't<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:51.989> good<00:00:52.200> because<00:00:52.380> like<00:00:52.770> well

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
doesn't look as good because like well

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.889 
doesn't look as good because like well
for<00:00:53.820> these<00:00:53.910> ones<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> stairs

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
for these ones I want to put the stairs

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
for these ones I want to put the stairs
there<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.309> makes<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
there because it just kind of makes the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.190 
there because it just kind of makes the
doorway<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.570> bigger<00:00:57.780> even<00:00:58.020> though<00:00:58.079> it's

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
doorway look bigger even though it's

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.799 
doorway look bigger even though it's
only<00:00:58.260> too<00:00:58.469> high<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.360> kind<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
only too high but over here it's kind of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.299 
only too high but over here it's kind of
weird<00:01:01.380> with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> stairs<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.070> floor

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
weird with the stairs on the floor

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.380 
weird with the stairs on the floor
that's<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:02.760> only<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> could<00:01:03.149> figure<00:01:03.300> out

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that's the only way I could figure out

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
that's the only way I could figure out
how<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.750> even<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> look

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
how to get it even because if you look

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.030 
how to get it even because if you look
in<00:01:05.219> there<00:01:05.339> Adam<00:01:05.579> just<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.969> there<00:01:06.090> okay<00:01:07.079> like

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
in there Adam just go in there okay like

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.740 
in there Adam just go in there okay like
there's<00:01:08.159> no<00:01:08.369> rest<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> hallway<00:01:09.149> not<00:01:09.570> right

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
there's no rest on the hallway not right

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.319 
there's no rest on the hallway not right
it's<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:09.960> good<00:01:10.170> mm-hmm<00:01:12.920> mmm<00:01:13.920> yeah<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.429> I<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
it's all good mm-hmm mmm yeah and I just

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's all good mm-hmm mmm yeah and I just
want<00:01:15.569> to<00:01:15.689> figure<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.109> out<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.619> yeah<00:01:17.399> I<00:01:17.609> don't

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
want to figure that out and yeah I don't

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.859 
want to figure that out and yeah I don't
think<00:01:17.819> I'm<00:01:17.969> gonna<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.149> using<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.539> one<00:01:18.659> very

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
think I'm gonna be using that one very

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.980 
think I'm gonna be using that one very
much<00:01:19.549> but<00:01:20.549> yeah<00:01:20.969> it's<00:01:21.209> just<00:01:21.359> it<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.749> just<00:01:21.779> kind

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
much but yeah it's just it was just kind

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.269 
much but yeah it's just it was just kind
of<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.109> prototype<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.069> could<00:01:23.130> do

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:23.279 
of a prototype just to see if I could do

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:25.580 
of a prototype just to see if I could do
it<00:01:23.310> looks<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.029> cleaner<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.810> mmm

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it looks a little cleaner as well mmm

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.099 
it looks a little cleaner as well mmm
yeah<00:01:25.850> yeah<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.029> then<00:01:27.179> pretty<00:01:27.569> much<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.869> one

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
yeah yeah and then pretty much this one

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.019 
yeah yeah and then pretty much this one
I'm<00:01:28.649> showing<00:01:28.859> the<00:01:29.069> concept<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.609> how<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:30.029 
I'm showing the concept of how I do it

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:31.940 
I'm showing the concept of how I do it
pretty<00:01:30.630> much<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.049> were<00:01:31.139> the<00:01:31.289> redstone<00:01:31.829> signal

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
pretty much you were the redstone signal

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
pretty much you were the redstone signal
comes<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.459> like<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.759> could<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.090> pressure

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
comes in like this could be the pressure

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.599 
comes in like this could be the pressure
plate<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.719> the<00:01:33.749> button<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.920> comes<00:01:35.159> down<00:01:35.369> here

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
plate or the button it comes down here

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.069 
plate or the button it comes down here
and<00:01:35.880> premier<00:01:36.179> separates<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:36.929> that

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and premier separates to the one that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
and premier separates to the one that
goes<00:01:37.200> underneath<00:01:37.709> and<00:01:38.130> extends<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.819> they

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
goes underneath and extends that they

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.999 
goes underneath and extends that they

on<00:01:43.349> the<00:01:43.409> side<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:45.179> would<00:01:45.450> boot<00:01:45.599> and<00:01:46.369> then

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
on the side if that would boot and then

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.099 
on the side if that would boot and then
from<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.299> extended<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
from the one that is extended from the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.279 
from the one that is extended from the
side<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.279> go<00:01:50.490> take<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> wire<00:01:51.419> up<00:01:51.779> here<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
side I just go take the wire up here and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.260 
side I just go take the wire up here and
then<00:01:52.529> it<00:01:52.709> extends<00:01:53.219> one<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.459> the<00:01:53.549> top<00:01:53.669> which<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
then it extends one on the top which is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.879 
then it extends one on the top which is
how<00:01:54.419> I<00:01:54.479> had<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.719> redstone<00:01:56.569> yes<00:01:57.569> if<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.560> made

how I had a redstone yes if that made

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.669 
how I had a redstone yes if that made
any<00:01:58.919> sense<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.549> how<00:01:59.669> it<00:01:59.759> does<00:01:59.849> it<00:01:59.999> I<00:02:00.779> will<00:02:01.439> I

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679
