00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.190
 a final step of showing bad as a burdock and IT systems 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.150
 can 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.519
 I know there are already maybe it would be for members of this team 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.749
 but I would have asked a lot in my works 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.460
 Only then I thought he was doing a trend to kill 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.849
 if the plan he sees the best times opens the most likely 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.460
 thanks to recommendations for conflict 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 and then timely Riester settings 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.100
 Ernst then he is just stop myself because that's how Beckham at the table 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.430
 seated 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180
 yes then it is only now 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 and can immediately set the language 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 already shows 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.680
 that would be the next of pte by Ernst Barlach 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.220
 Take Waldniel 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.339
 that's just ramp of the most important 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.340
 to the employees 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.230
 and I see I also had a mixer and you think that's best 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 while Western countries picture 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.160
 and everyone can get on with it 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.370
 Play Rijkaard 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.310
 and then the merchants attract ZDB 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 Broadcast percent like that record 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.250
 so emblazoned at Broadcast, everyone knows everyone 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.950
 can go concrete 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.590
 and then quickly make her master are easy and direct 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.630
 then take the Mavs and Miami 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.399
 and so noticeably rising with CRI trained by us it is now called that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.960
 and everyone can do that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 that is the most important is a light that takes mp3 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.910
 who else could not be on the 7th 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.490
 with it could be 28 pupil class in those 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.150
 and he makes the one podcast for Bush's reign 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.080
 and then it can test badly 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.160
 but i see a time z the export quantity steampunk de 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.180
 He just goes for it 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.460
 and then the women 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.590
 and pressed her in the evening of Getafe she also tests us 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.639
 in the description 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.069
 and then I'm sitting here 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.409
 St 1 § 3 occupies cases occupied place 13 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.969
 of course you had it outdoors I am now went it 1 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:25.209
 so thanks to appetite asbestos 1 points to minus 10 points just 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:29.009
 and then the hosts in the same one 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.979
 with the pope 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.289
 Anton Menth hate 45 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.289
 and that of course also weighs in the parties 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.739
 because the password 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.189
 that is now standing 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.179
 Pushing the kids should push that 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.409
 Group with my adviser is that the charming one 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.409
 Ultimately, the situation is not changed said Weichert 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.519
 what looked first 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.949
 now beats for the president 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.489
 why the animal names 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.659
 and the name is the core name of the shipment 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.079
 that's not really true now 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.789
 Messi l did not show 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.759
 In McDonald's other Flanagan had the death of the animals, it is important 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.609
 Thanks to Antic each of the barbed wire the pitfalls 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.189
 only tip is 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.889
 the chirping 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.209
 yes you are occupied now 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.549
 individual projects is 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.129
 Broadcast is allowed to do so it simply judged another reason 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.089
 gigantic conflict 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.799
 and give other numbers again 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.449
 and hope that not occupied 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.799
 so chased it is not occupied 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.579
 and then 60 iPad casting tape as five percent minus 4 points he 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.870
 and then the time already in the afterlife 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.169
 and when the first league played 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.599
 in principle it is not possible 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.189
 only six updated 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.069
 ZDS five then I could even hear myself at all 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.199
 and the kind of test »necessary and now 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.669
 then if I have not stubbled by Stephen Wolf children 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.900
 podium 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.969
 and 4 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.020
 Ladies around 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.559
 When I watch a song the game looks easy 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.520
 gt on these routes 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.960
 and then i could not make e-bikers 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.490
 make 1 with concerts 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.659
 in the stable adviser Dirk Rautmann nothing 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.659
 and he will create a playlist 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.319
 in the trade press 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.360
 to move in as many titles as the words here to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.449
 van Gaal 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.650
 maybe it's counting on the Europe League 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.039
 in Wittlich II 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.039
 and here also presented with second spook 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.719
 who had then there is an automatic override 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:11.099
 and that done so far in between 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.969
 and the 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.370
 and then when talking to an ECG forest camp just church circle 

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:18.169
 honest 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.169
 Mr Dantse target 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.620
 here has the firmly attuned next Mandac-kd- Rheine does not have that 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.229
 Instinct since the bed on it are the comments I can not meet 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.799
 and years thanks for beating fish until next time
