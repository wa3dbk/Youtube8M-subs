00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.810
 many options to customize them 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.199
 up to make it similar to himself 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.869
 and then to create the avatar this program 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.840
 allows you to make comics in different 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.210
 scenes situations modes and so on 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.760

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.860
 application 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.860

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.800

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.610
 in going to the application 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.130
 as in the account that we are explaining 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.250
 the avatar is already created 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.700
 we will proceed to explain how to perform the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.700
 comic 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.400
 at the top you will appear 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.400
 different options 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.100
 make a comic book status 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.240
 to friends how to jump 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.850
 We recommend the last option sand 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.850
 where will we start to create the treat 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.750
 after choosing that option 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.170
 observe the avatars that have their 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.009
 and there you can choose one of them to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.009
 that appear in your food 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 then this page takes you to different 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.930
 scenarios and you choose which one is the most 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.930

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.790

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.439
 after choosing 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.650
 the emotions that represent your avatar 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:06.420
 You can add the text using the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.420
 balloons that appear on the top 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.540
 there are different designs for the wolves 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.540

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:30.190
