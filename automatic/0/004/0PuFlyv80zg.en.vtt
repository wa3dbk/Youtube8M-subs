they<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.350> stated<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.100> be

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
they have stated that there will be

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.969 
they have stated that there will be
multiple<00:01:53.820> weapon<00:01:54.299> DLC<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> assume

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
multiple weapon DLC and we can assume

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980 
multiple weapon DLC and we can assume
via<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> leak<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.149> covered<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> few<00:01:57.780> weeks

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
via the leak that I covered a few weeks

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
via the leak that I covered a few weeks
ago<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.710> numbering<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> weapon<00:01:59.790> DLC

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
ago the numbering for the weapon DLC

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.870 
ago the numbering for the weapon DLC
went<00:02:00.659> from<00:02:00.869> 1<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.469> 4<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.369> would<00:02:02.579> assume

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
went from 1 to 4 so that would assume

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.219 
went from 1 to 4 so that would assume
and<00:02:03.090> highly<00:02:03.420> hint<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> fact<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.079> we

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
and highly hint at the fact that we

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.899 
and highly hint at the fact that we
should<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.469> getting<00:02:04.770> one<00:02:05.009> piece<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.490> weapon

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909

four pieces will link back to the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.699 
four pieces will link back to the

played since release not to sure that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.809 
played since release not to sure that
could<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.440> been<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.800> sort<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.160> test

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
could have been like a sort of test

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.180 
could have been like a sort of test

within each of the map packs could be a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.150 
within each of the map packs could be a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
lot bigger and hopefully even cooler so

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.530 
lot bigger and hopefully even cooler so
we<00:02:38.250> now<00:02:38.400> know<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> basis<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.209> what<00:02:39.420> we're

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
we now know the basis of what we're

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.699 
we now know the basis of what we're
going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:39.810> getting<00:02:40.049> within<00:02:40.290> each<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
Call of Duty we can see and take a look

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.550 
Call of Duty we can see and take a look
at<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.690> looks<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.110> very<00:02:46.410> first

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
at what looks to be the very first

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.610 
at what looks to be the very first
weapon<00:02:47.099> DLC<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.000> first<00:02:48.299> onslaught<00:02:49.230> map

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
weapon DLC for the first onslaught map

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
weapon DLC for the first onslaught map
pack<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.250> also<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.540> multiplayer

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
pack and also one of the multiplayer

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.020 
pack and also one of the multiplayer
maps<00:02:52.620> when<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.130> cover<00:02:53.459> some<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.849> leaked

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
maps when I cover some of the leaked

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.759 
maps when I cover some of the leaked
names<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> multiplayer<00:02:54.959> maps<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.590> map

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
names for the multiplayer maps the map

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.280 
names for the multiplayer maps the map
swamp<00:02:56.430> did<00:02:56.940> come<00:02:57.209> up<00:02:57.360> within<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.870> name<00:02:58.049> list

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
swamp did come up within the name list

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.869 
swamp did come up within the name list
so<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.500> looks<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:58.769> swamp<00:02:59.160> will<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.430> included

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
so it looks like swamp will be included

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.670 
so it looks like swamp will be included
within<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.239> first<00:03:00.480> map<00:03:00.750> pack<00:03:00.989> along<00:03:01.620> with

within the first map pack along with

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.949 
within the first map pack along with
this<00:03:02.160> brand<00:03:02.489> new<00:03:02.730> weapon<00:03:03.180> at<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.599> moment<00:03:03.870> I'm

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
this brand new weapon at the moment I'm

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.050 
this brand new weapon at the moment I'm
not<00:03:04.019> too<00:03:04.379> sure<00:03:04.680> exactly<00:03:04.860> what<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.519> weapon<00:03:05.700> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
not too sure exactly what this weapon is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.970 
not too sure exactly what this weapon is
