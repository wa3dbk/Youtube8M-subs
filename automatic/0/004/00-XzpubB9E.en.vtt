of<00:02:42.630> jump<00:02:42.840> right<00:02:42.990> now<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.590> look<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:43.920> this

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
of jump right now so we look at this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.580 
of jump right now so we look at this
eccentric<00:02:44.850> utilization<00:02:45.480> ratio<00:02:45.930> I'm<00:02:46.350> going<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
eccentric utilization ratio I'm going to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.500 
eccentric utilization ratio I'm going to
compare<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> height<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> jump<00:02:47.430> from<00:02:47.730> vertical

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
compare a height of jump from vertical

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.420 
compare a height of jump from vertical
jump<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.989> squat<00:02:49.260> jump<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.739> we've<00:02:49.830> got<00:02:49.950> thirteen

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430

gonna<00:03:33.270> explode<00:03:33.660> out<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.050> position<00:03:34.260> okay

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
gonna explode out of that position okay

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.250 
gonna explode out of that position okay
so<00:03:35.880> we're<00:03:36.090> going<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.300> get<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.600> true

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
so we're going to get a true

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.290 
so we're going to get a true
however<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.100> how<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> jump<00:03:38.640> from<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.970> squat

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
however and how to jump from a squat

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.660 
however and how to jump from a squat
position<00:03:39.510> my<00:03:40.290> out<00:03:40.410> test<00:03:40.680> controls<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
position my out test controls the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.430 
position my out test controls the
ethicacy<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> movement<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.050> we<00:03:43.140> know<00:03:43.290> we're

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
ethicacy the movement so we know we're

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.070 
ethicacy the movement so we know we're
getting<00:03:43.500> good<00:03:43.800> dad<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.550> important<00:03:45.080> so

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
getting good dad this is important so

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.150 
getting good dad this is important so
I'll<00:03:46.170> wait<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.650> beat<00:03:49.310> drop<00:03:50.310> down<00:03:50.640> called

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
I'll wait for the beat drop down called
