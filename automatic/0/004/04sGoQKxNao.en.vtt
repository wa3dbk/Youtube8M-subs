exercises<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.350> had<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> use<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> spirometer

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
exercises you had to use a spirometer

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889 
exercises you had to use a spirometer
right<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:53.969> explain<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.539> bit<00:00:54.719> about

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
right can you explain a little bit about

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
right can you explain a little bit about
what<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:55.829> expensive<00:00:56.219> they<00:00:56.550> are

medical spirometer

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
medical spirometer
is<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> device<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> measure<00:01:00.719> boys<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.460> but

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
is a device to measure boys actually but

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
is a device to measure boys actually but
this<00:01:03.030> device<00:01:03.329> costs<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.870> least<00:01:03.930> $2,000<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this device costs at least $2,000 and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.130 
this device costs at least $2,000 and
it's<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.610> expensive<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.180> family<00:01:06.600> and

it's really expensive for family and
visit<00:01:07.830> artists<00:01:08.299> that's<00:01:09.299> why<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.630> create<00:01:10.020> our

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
visit artists that's why we create our

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
visit artists that's why we create our
own<00:01:10.260> prototype<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> kilometer<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
own prototype of the kilometer but it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.620 
own prototype of the kilometer but it
cost<00:01:12.450> less<00:01:12.630> than<00:01:13.070> $200<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.000> guys<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
cost less than $200 so you guys you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
cost less than $200 so you guys you
looked<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> spirometer<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.369> said

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
looked at the spirometer and you said

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
looked at the spirometer and you said
this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> too<00:01:18.479> expensive

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
this is too expensive

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
this is too expensive
and<00:01:19.490> what<00:01:20.490> did<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.850> did<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> find<00:01:21.479> just

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and what did you do did you find just

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
and what did you do did you find just
like<00:01:21.840> simple<00:01:22.229> off-the-shelf<00:01:22.530> stuff<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like simple off-the-shelf stuff that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.190 
like simple off-the-shelf stuff that
would<00:01:23.759> work<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
would work that's it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
would work that's it
walk<00:01:25.409> me<00:01:25.590> through<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.009> happens<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> kid

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
