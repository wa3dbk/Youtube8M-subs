your own single-player as well just like

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.060 
your own single-player as well just like
the<00:00:18.630> orb<00:00:18.930> explosion<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> show<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.890> guys

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the orb explosion that I show you guys

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
the orb explosion that I show you guys
so<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.270> point<00:00:21.390> eight<00:00:21.510> point<00:00:21.689> seven

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
so going to one point eight point seven

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720 
so going to one point eight point seven
minecraft<00:00:22.380> go<00:00:23.010> any<00:00:23.130> single<00:00:23.340> player<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
minecraft go any single player and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.630 
minecraft go any single player and
create<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.359> world<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.230> raining<00:00:25.949> probably

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
create a world that is raining probably

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.920 
create a world that is raining probably
not<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:26.939> survival<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.810> this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
not your survival will because this

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.390 
not your survival will because this
might<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.289> corrupt<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.039> no<00:00:29.220> idea

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
might actually corrupt it I have no idea

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.710 
might actually corrupt it I have no idea
what<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.910> happens<00:00:30.210> when<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
what it really happens when you do this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.520 
what it really happens when you do this
so<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:32.360> single-player<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:34.110> going

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so going to your single-player I'm going

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.430 
so going to your single-player I'm going
to<00:00:34.590> create<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> world<00:00:35.070> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.460> super<00:00:35.790> flat<00:00:36.440> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to create a world which is super flat so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.840 
to create a world which is super flat so
it's<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> easiest<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> demonstrate<00:00:38.700> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it's the easiest one to demonstrate on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.750 
it's the easiest one to demonstrate on
my<00:00:38.969> computer<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> super<00:00:41.100> flat<00:00:41.309> obviously

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
my computer so super flat obviously

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
my computer so super flat obviously
you're<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.719> spawn<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.260> Plains<00:00:43.500> biome<00:00:43.860> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you're in you spawn in a Plains biome so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
you're in you spawn in a Plains biome so
it's<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> rain<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.600> follow<00:00:45.840> these

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it's going to rain so follow these

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.470 
it's going to rain so follow these
instructions<00:00:46.010> carefully<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.820> set<00:00:48.390> your

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
instructions carefully so set your

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
instructions carefully so set your
weather<00:00:48.660> terrain<00:00:48.870> first<00:00:49.489> obviously<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
weather terrain first obviously this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479 
weather terrain first obviously this
will<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.000> happen<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.829> you're<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> desert<00:00:53.219> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
will not happen if you're in a desert or

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.750 
will not happen if you're in a desert or
Mesa<00:00:53.760> biome<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.980> teleport

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Mesa biome do that and then teleport

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.170 
Mesa biome do that and then teleport
yourself

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
yourself

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540 
yourself
1<00:00:57.600> billion<00:00:57.899> blocks<00:00:58.320> yes<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.129> right<00:00:59.280> 1

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
1 billion blocks yes that's right 1

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
1 billion blocks yes that's right 1
billion<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.559> 9<00:01:01.559> 0<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.160> 1<00:01:02.340> 2<00:01:02.489> 3<00:01:02.730> 4<00:01:03.120> 5<00:01:03.270> 6<00:01:03.480> 7<00:01:03.719> 8

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
billion so that's 9 0 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
billion so that's 9 0 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> 1<00:01:05.880> billion<00:01:06.090> blocks<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.450> doesn't<00:01:06.689> matter

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
9 so 1 billion blocks up doesn't matter

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.250 
9 so 1 billion blocks up doesn't matter
what<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.170> XZ<00:01:08.010> corners<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.780> press<00:01:09.780> enter<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
what your XZ corners are press enter and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.039 
what your XZ corners are press enter and
this<00:01:10.710> happens<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.600> absolutely<00:01:12.960> no

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
this happens so I have absolutely no

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
this happens so I have absolutely no
idea<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.470> okay<00:01:14.310> please<00:01:14.729> tell<00:01:14.909> me<00:01:15.060> if

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
idea what this is okay please tell me if

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300 
idea what this is okay please tell me if
you<00:01:15.270> guys<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.600> any<00:01:15.689> idea<00:01:15.960> I've<00:01:16.860> been<00:01:17.100> told

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you guys have any idea I've been told

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
you guys have any idea I've been told
perhaps<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.119> could<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.479> snow<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.560> not

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
perhaps it could be snow that's not

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.020 
perhaps it could be snow that's not
rendering<00:01:20.009> properly<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> doesn't

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
rendering properly because it doesn't

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
rendering properly because it doesn't
like<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.590> there's<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.740> no<00:01:22.920> other

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
like kind of there's really no other

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.090 
like kind of there's really no other
explanation<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:26.479> yeah<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
explanation I can think of yeah as you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
explanation I can think of yeah as you
guys<00:01:29.250> would<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> fly<00:01:30.360> very<00:01:30.869> high<00:01:31.079> up

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
guys would know if you fly very high up

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
guys would know if you fly very high up
in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> sky<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> doesn't<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.250> doesn't<00:01:32.430> matter

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
in the sky it doesn't it doesn't matter

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210 
in the sky it doesn't it doesn't matter
what<00:01:33.060> biome<00:01:33.570> you're<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.829> might<00:01:35.009> start

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
what biome you're in it might start

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
what biome you're in it might start
snowing<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> rains<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.710> it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
snowing if it rains that is so it's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.730 
snowing if it rains that is so it's
actually<00:01:38.579> quite<00:01:38.850> cool<00:01:39.509> something<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.590> do

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
actually quite cool something you can do

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.200 
actually quite cool something you can do
with<00:01:41.009> cutscenes<00:01:42.020> some<00:01:43.020> sort<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> hyperspace

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
with cutscenes some sort of hyperspace

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.649 
with cutscenes some sort of hyperspace
definitely<00:01:45.210> reminds<00:01:45.390> me<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
definitely reminds me of that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.120 
definitely reminds me of that
interstellar<00:01:46.110> scene<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.500> Matthew

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
interstellar scene where Matthew

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.289 
interstellar scene where Matthew
McConaughey<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.670> messing<00:01:48.000> around<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
McConaughey was messing around with the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.359 
McConaughey was messing around with the
Morse<00:01:48.509> code<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> dimension<00:01:49.369> actually

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
Morse code in that dimension actually

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.600 
Morse code in that dimension actually
saw<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.820> during<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.750> livestream<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:53.250> was

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
saw this during my livestream it was
