00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
people really praised this film but I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.670 
people really praised this film but I
can't<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.530> why<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:12.330> story<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:13.110> simple<00:01:13.650> but

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
can't see why the story was simple but

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.330 
can't see why the story was simple but
ok<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> heavy<00:01:15.930> story<00:01:16.470> film<00:01:16.979> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
ok it's not really a heavy story film so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.170 
ok it's not really a heavy story film so
much<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.229> setup<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.280> really

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
have to admit it has a strange appeal to

it despite how awful it is it is still a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.150 
it despite how awful it is it is still a
fairly<00:02:08.000> interesting<00:02:09.000> piece

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
fairly interesting piece

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
but not interesting enough to get a good

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.290 
but not interesting enough to get a good
rating<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.040> give<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.550> point<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.030> out<00:02:15.240> of
