00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 inevitably walking among the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 stores the eye falls into the various benches 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.820
 ice creams that abound in gluttony of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
 every type and every color 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.410
 Not always, however, can he find them 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 perfect ice cream just what it does at 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 our case and that is able to satisfy the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 our needs such as 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.160
 lactose-free ice creams the right ice creams 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 the power of the lawyers therefore I will 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 I suggest walking in front of the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.669
 ice cream parlors with a nice ice cream a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.520
 chocolate prepared with your hands 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.829
 but not a simple ice cream an ice cream 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.680
 without lactose without cholesterol and without 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.309
 animal derived fats we prepare 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.289
 together to prepare 6 portions of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.950
 chocolate ice cream without lactose 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.850
 therefore vegan need 500 books 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.390
 liters of soy milk 250 milliliters of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.090
 vegetable cream 150 g of sugar 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 caster 25 grams of dextrose 5 grams 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 of carob seed flour that will be the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 our thickener for 10 grams 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.830
 of inulin that allows us to reduce the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.159
 amount of fat inside the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 ice cream itself to finish 50 g of cocoa 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.860
 therefore we prepare bitter powder 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.759
 unveiled vegan chocolate in one 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 casseruolina we put soy milk 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:38.909
 better if self-produced then cream 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.820
 250,000 vegetable perfect we add 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.680
 now the lille dextrose sugars that there 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.040
 lowers the freezing point of the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.549
 mass now we have also started a 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.549
 know him well 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.649
 granulated sugar 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.829
 we always mix and now add to 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.469
 cold our stabilizer for 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.280
 ice cream or seed flour from 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.440
 carob carob seed flour yes 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.930
 disperses well as I said before is a 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.230
 warm and cold its dispersion a 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.010
 cold does not generate problems because it is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.380
 insoluble therefore not from citrus however it is 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.599
 recommended to keep 80 degrees for 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.540
 at least two minutes for his complete 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.580
 solubilization and to ensure that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.040
 our frost stabilizer 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.030
 manage to exercise his best 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:41.340
 thickening capacity we can now 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.430
 heat our mixture and with the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.250
 food thermometer we measure the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.000
 temperature when it reaches 45 degrees 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.200
 We can also add new 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.390
 meanwhile we continue to stir 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 reached 45 degrees as I said before 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.790
 we can also disperse our in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.079
 perfect line so now slowly 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.579
 we also add the bitter cocoa in 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.739
 dust that I have previously 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.389
 sieved I recommend sieved to you 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.280
 otherwise in short, maybe you can 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.850
 will form lumps is not really the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.160
 maximum 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.340
 add it slowly composed 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.500
 always stirring always maintaining 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.500
 also a fairly sustained flame 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.650
 for soul to use our best 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:39.099
 carob flour then we will keep for 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.099
 at least two minutes and 80 85 degrees 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.840
 we brought our blend first 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.579
 at 80 degrees then at 85 for the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.010
 pasteurization then for the correct 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.560
 conservation of the final product 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.450
 now let it cool completely 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.060
 our vegan chocolate ice cream 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.870
 for about 6 12 hours before at temperature 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.879
 environment 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 then clearly in the refrigerator for the 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.989
 ripening stage so that everyone 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.060
 dry ingredients if they succeed 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.620
 hydrate perfectly and reduce 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.489
 also the risk of forming in 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.219
 ice crystals in the final ice cream 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.840
 after 6 12 hours of cooling see 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:18.680
 this is clearly the result 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.220
 cream has thickened we can 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.389
 transfer it into an ice cream maker 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.539
 being careful maybe not to get dirty 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.889
 everywhere and we will let it whisk until 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.030
 reaching consistency 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.340
 desired 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.500
 after which we will not let the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.960
 our comfort to better better ad 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.680
 learn in the freezer for years less 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.680
 mezz'oretta 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.630
 wow if this ice cream is good and the 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.789
 demonstration that this is not the case 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.789
 important to use cow's milk 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.830
 fresh cream or eggs to get a 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.380
 greedy fresh dessert just like 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.030
 this by correctly balancing fats 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.250
 and sugars we got a result 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.190
 really mouth-watering 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.949
 ah I forgot the prepared wafer 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.300
 completely without 100 per 100 eggs 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.300
 vegetable where ga
