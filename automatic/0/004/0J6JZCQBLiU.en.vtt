00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.300
 hello everyone nikolai today on 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.820
 green we learn to just regulate 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.050
 sink and bathtub . 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.730
 that's generally the main problem is always 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.949
 happy if you have any quarrels 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.630
 It lies in the fact that in vacation hair 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.429
 or any food residue 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.509
 Get into this little thing 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:32.239
 siphon if this happened all your you 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.879
 poorly washed off water in the sink or in 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.820
 bath for 40 reasons you need this one 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.340
 piece disassemble these will show it done 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.019
 very simple, even a child does not define 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.000
 able to do it in principle here 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:49.550
 disassemble clean for rubbish and all but more often 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.769
 most often the problem for a quarrel it 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.120
 not due to the fact that you have something there 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.070
 clogged and with exactly corrugated given 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.320
 other 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.620
 Now corrugated pipe often here 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.050
 how many different pipes have i seen 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.900
 sag yes here for example she see 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.280
 how to sagging as if he did not do it 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.890
 will still rule went on just 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.100
 too if you look like this is all 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.610
 done before the page page here these 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.810
 here's a curved pipe and it fits here 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.760
 this thing is long and not enough to 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.880
 correctly this is all turned out 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.070
 so that was a competent angle and how it can be 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 fix now i'll show the easiest 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.420
 the way is these yokes are sold you 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.850
 can someone here showing you can 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.830
 drill holes give respectively 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.650
 fix this corrugated 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.310
 pipe so yes this is the first way 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.610
 he certainly requires that you 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.470
 there was a special attack drill better yes 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.080
 screwdriver there is not so powerful and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.210
 special tile or drill bit 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.440
 glass yes if you have it no question 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.820
 but you can bother with it 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.670
 put such a temporary thing which 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.909
 Now I will do exactly what you need 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 just simply 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:18.849
 rope up to which you pipe 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:23.879
 pull up here she is dear and see how 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:28.150
 you need to do this here 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.219
 that's the distance 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.659
 may not be very attractive things 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:37.599
 very pretty but still she 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.659
 works for a while she will 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.720
 serve faithfully 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.450
 Well, and then you can already calculated on 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.939
 any such 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.159
 more correct way is of course 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.510
 traveling here and so when raising or 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.269
 of course you can still go there yourself 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.400
 corrugated pipe reduce here or 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.459
 somehow bring something there is in general such 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.530
 temporary way if you have a problem with 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.280
 so that you have 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.439
 bath or sink washes away for a very long time 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.379
 water from this there with on the bacteria multiplies 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.840
 this is very bad here is the easiest way 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.620
 just make a pipe on a string under 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.470
 that angle 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.090
 so as not to sink that's not the show is not the top 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.930
 sagged such an arc 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.909
 and already about an angle down this is very important and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.970
 then you solve this problem once and 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.120
 here forever like a small life hacking 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.470
 do it in 2 minutes well well big 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.470
 thanks to new meetings bye
