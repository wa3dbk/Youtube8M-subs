00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.670 
that really kept building in my mind for
an<00:06:03.130> idea<00:06:03.610> was<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.390> city<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:04.870> the<00:06:04.900> river<00:06:05.170> but

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
an idea was the city and the river but

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.180 
an idea was the city and the river but
that's<00:06:05.890> where<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.510> series<00:06:07.510> came<00:06:07.840> from<00:06:08.200> and<00:06:08.560> it

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
that's where the series came from and it

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.910 
that's where the series came from and it
was<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.820> fact<00:06:10.000> that<00:06:10.090> I<00:06:10.210> was<00:06:10.300> very<00:06:10.540> sick<00:06:10.840> I<00:06:11.110> saw

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
was the fact that I was very sick I saw

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.130 
was the fact that I was very sick I saw
hope<00:06:12.190> through<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.700> window<00:06:12.910> and<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.930> saw

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
hope through that window and I saw

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.350 
hope through that window and I saw
something<00:06:14.500> I<00:06:14.560> wanted<00:06:14.980> and<00:06:15.220> I<00:06:15.820> was<00:06:16.030> determined

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
something I wanted and I was determined

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.450 
something I wanted and I was determined
I<00:06:16.810> was<00:06:16.840> going<00:06:17.170> to<00:06:17.230> get<00:06:17.350> back<00:06:17.590> out<00:06:17.740> there<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:18.190> do

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
I was going to get back out there and do

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.650 
I was going to get back out there and do
it<00:06:18.610> again<00:06:20.400> these<00:06:21.400> landscapes<00:06:21.700> are<00:06:22.210> not<00:06:22.390> like

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
it again these landscapes are not like

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.370 
it again these landscapes are not like
paintings<00:06:23.200> there's<00:06:23.920> a<00:06:24.310> lot<00:06:24.730> of<00:06:24.760> a<00:06:25.170> hope<00:06:26.170> in

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
paintings there's a lot of a hope in

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.530 
paintings there's a lot of a hope in
them<00:06:26.530> if<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:27.220> don't<00:06:27.430> know<00:06:27.520> what<00:06:27.790> it's<00:06:28.300> like<00:06:28.420> to

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
them if you don't know what it's like to

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.140 
them if you don't know what it's like to
pick<00:06:28.930> yourself<00:06:29.050> up<00:06:29.560> after<00:06:30.490> being<00:06:30.730> knocked

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
pick yourself up after being knocked

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.210 
pick yourself up after being knocked
into<00:06:31.420> the<00:06:31.600> ground<00:06:31.840> a<00:06:31.960> couple<00:06:32.230> of<00:06:32.290> times<00:06:32.530> and

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
into the ground a couple of times and

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.340 
into the ground a couple of times and
get<00:06:33.400> back<00:06:33.460> into<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:34.000> game<00:06:34.150> of<00:06:34.330> life<00:06:34.480> that's

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
get back into the game of life that's

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.260 
get back into the game of life that's
what<00:06:35.530> made<00:06:36.010> these<00:06:36.250> paintings<00:06:36.760> is<00:06:37.030> just

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
what made these paintings is just

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.030 
what made these paintings is just
basically<00:06:37.660> that<00:06:37.870> I<00:06:37.900> wanted<00:06:38.410> to<00:06:38.470> be<00:06:38.800> a

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
basically that I wanted to be a

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.480 
basically that I wanted to be a
celebration<00:06:39.640> of<00:06:40.240> life
