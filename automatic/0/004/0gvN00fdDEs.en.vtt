00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
grayling is is that an original design

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.910 
grayling is is that an original design
or<00:02:05.200> did<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.380> see<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.890> period<00:02:06.490> horn<00:02:07.920> its

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
or did you see it on a period horn its

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.919 
or did you see it on a period horn its
original<00:02:09.459> as<00:02:09.610> far<00:02:09.819> as<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.149> know<00:02:10.209> but<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
original as far as I know but and the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.229 
original as far as I know but and the
reason<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.350> did<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.800> was<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.370> horn<00:02:12.670> had<00:02:12.880> very

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
reason I did it was this horn had very

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.360 
reason I did it was this horn had very
little<00:02:13.450> mass<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> end<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.800> uh-huh

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
little mass in the end of it uh-huh

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.820 
little mass in the end of it uh-huh
and<00:02:15.459> so<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.300> couldn't<00:02:16.750> do<00:02:16.959> deep<00:02:17.230> cuts<00:02:17.560> like

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
and so you couldn't do deep cuts like

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.949 
and so you couldn't do deep cuts like
this<00:02:18.069> one<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.610> instance<00:02:18.700> where<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.660> like

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
this one for instance where this is like

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.930 
this one for instance where this is like
heavily<00:02:20.500> carved<00:02:20.980> down<00:02:21.130> here<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.640> then<00:02:21.760> these

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
heavily carved down here and then these

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.210 
heavily carved down here and then these
are<00:02:22.000> all<00:02:22.300> carved<00:02:22.660> up<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.020> here<00:02:23.260> uh-huh

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
are all carved up in here uh-huh

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.949 
are all carved up in here uh-huh
so<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:26.050> order<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.470> set<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:28.120> order<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.450> separate
