00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the pitch we always felt that it would

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649

be quicker you know we were quicker and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
be quicker you know we were quicker and
more<00:01:33.780> mobile<00:01:33.990> defenders<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> Wimbledon

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
centre forward so even if he made a run

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
centre forward so even if he made a run
inside<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.670> covering<00:01:39.090> positions

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

type of position and that can happen
sometimes<00:01:53.930> when<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> don't<00:01:55.259> engage<00:01:55.439> early

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sometimes when you don't engage early

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.219 
sometimes when you don't engage early
enough<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> always<00:01:57.200> particularly<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
enough and how it always particularly I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
enough and how it always particularly I
think<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> career<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.610> at

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
think in the career that we had at

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.249 
think in the career that we had at
United<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.240> would<00:02:00.360> always<00:02:00.479> try<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:01.049> sure

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
United we would always try and make sure

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
United we would always try and make sure
we<00:02:01.380> didn't<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.649> into<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:01.979> situation<00:02:02.159> I'll

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
we didn't get into this situation I'll

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.959 
we didn't get into this situation I'll
just<00:02:03.299> move<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> players<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.969> because

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
just move the players up here because

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.910 
just move the players up here because
when<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.659> placed<00:02:07.350> that's<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> left

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
when you get them placed that's the left

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.870 
when you get them placed that's the left
back<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.220> he's<00:02:08.340> getting<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
back and he's getting it in this

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.319 
back and he's getting it in this
position<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.570> we're<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:11.329> if

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
position here and we're like this if

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.300 
position here and we're like this if
they're<00:02:13.110> playing<00:02:13.320> those<00:02:13.530> passes<00:02:13.950> from<00:02:14.040> here

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
they're playing those passes from here

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.340 
they're playing those passes from here
into<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.390> edge<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.630> your<00:02:15.720> box

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
into the edge of your box

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
into the edge of your box
that's<00:02:16.829> where<00:02:17.130> then<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.459> really<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.880> get

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that's where then you really can get

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240 
that's where then you really can get
little<00:02:18.299> flick<00:02:18.540> ons<00:02:18.780> from<00:02:19.109> him<00:02:19.350> into<00:02:19.829> there<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
little flick ons from him into there it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.770 
little flick ons from him into there it
becomes<00:02:20.549> a<00:02:20.670> lot<00:02:20.790> more<00:02:21.000> dangerous<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> think

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
becomes a lot more dangerous so I think

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.479 
becomes a lot more dangerous so I think
the<00:02:21.930> first<00:02:22.140> principle<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:22.859> try<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.220> make

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
the first principle that we try to make

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.090 
the first principle that we try to make
sure<00:02:23.519> was<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.150> stopped<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.660> playing

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
sure was that we stopped them playing

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.610 
sure was that we stopped them playing
into<00:02:26.100> our<00:02:26.220> box<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:26.910> actually<00:02:27.500> went<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
into our box and we actually went and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.390 
into our box and we actually went and
attack<00:02:28.980> them<00:02:29.160> up<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.569> little<00:02:30.569> detail

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
attack them up here little detail

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960 
attack them up here little detail
goalkeeper<00:02:32.400> let's<00:02:32.640> say

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
goalkeeper let's say

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.960 
goalkeeper let's say
segars<00:02:33.810> at<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.990> time<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:35.160> made<00:02:35.370> sure<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.850> one

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
segars at the time we made sure that one

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.220 
segars at the time we made sure that one
of<00:02:36.000> our<00:02:36.210> forwards<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.050> like

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
of our forwards because what they like

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.780 
of our forwards because what they like
to<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.530> when<00:02:37.680> will<00:02:37.800> do<00:02:37.920> was<00:02:38.070> roll<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.460> ball<00:02:38.610> out

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
to do when will do was roll the ball out

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.300 
to do when will do was roll the ball out
of<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.910> box<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.330> goalkeeper<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.770> kick<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
of the box with a goalkeeper and kick it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.340 
of the box with a goalkeeper and kick it
right<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:42.150> top<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.510> were<00:02:42.660> made<00:02:42.900> sure<00:02:43.170> you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
right on top of this were made sure you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.780 
right on top of this were made sure you
have<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.530> kick<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:43.860> his<00:02:44.040> hands<00:02:44.340> that's<00:02:44.490> again

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
have to kick out his hands that's again

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.370 
have to kick out his hands that's again
other<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.330> things<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.840> try<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.110> do

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
other little things that you try and do

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.350 
other little things that you try and do
to<00:02:46.530> make<00:02:46.740> sure<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.280> your<00:02:47.790> life's<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.180> lot

to make sure that your life's a lot

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.610 
to make sure that your life's a lot
easier<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:48.930> you're<00:02:49.200> talking<00:02:49.470> about

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
easier because you're talking about

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.400 
easier because you're talking about
really<00:02:49.950> physical<00:02:50.750> competitive<00:02:51.750> players<00:02:52.080> who

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
really physical competitive players who

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.650 
really physical competitive players who
are<00:02:52.980> difficult<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.730> play<00:02:53.910> against<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> air

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
are difficult to play against in the air

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.600 
are difficult to play against in the air
when<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.620> into<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.830> final<00:02:56.220> third<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.460> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
when you get into the final third of the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.980 
when you get into the final third of the
pitch<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> will<00:02:57.330> bitch<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.840> will<00:02:57.960> be

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
pitch and the will bitch there will be

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.780 
pitch and the will bitch there will be
times<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> game<00:02:58.710> we<00:02:58.920> obviously<00:02:59.250> can't

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
times in the game we obviously can't

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.110 
times in the game we obviously can't
stop<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.560> stop<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.710> cross<00:03:01.950> teams<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:02.970> play

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
stop it stop the cross teams that play

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.640 
stop it stop the cross teams that play
the<00:03:03.240> long<00:03:03.390> ball<00:03:03.600> usually<00:03:04.020> have<00:03:04.110> good<00:03:04.230> crosses

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the long ball usually have good crosses

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.960 
the long ball usually have good crosses
of<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.830> ball<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.220> usually<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.700> good

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
of the ball they usually have good

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.520 
of the ball they usually have good
attackers<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> ball<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> air<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.380> then

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
attackers of the ball in the air so then

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.260 
attackers of the ball in the air so then
that's<00:03:08.220> where<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.550> defenders<00:03:08.970> we've<00:03:09.090> been

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
that's where your defenders we've been

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.880 
that's where your defenders we've been
here<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.840> you've<00:03:09.990> got<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.260> make<00:03:10.410> sure<00:03:10.440> these

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
here if you've got to make sure these

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.750 
here if you've got to make sure these
two<00:03:10.950> players<00:03:11.930> these<00:03:12.930> two<00:03:13.230> double<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.610> let's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
two players these two double up so let's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.100 
two players these two double up so let's
say<00:03:14.880> that's<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> Wimbledon<00:03:15.450> left<00:03:15.780> back<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
say that's the Wimbledon left back the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.810 
say that's the Wimbledon left back the
Wimbledon<00:03:16.350> left<00:03:16.650> winger<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.490> they've<00:03:17.640> got

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
Wimbledon left winger and they've got

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.699 
Wimbledon left winger and they've got
the<00:03:17.910> ball<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.540> right<00:03:19.020> back<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.500> got

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the ball at that right back that's got

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.110 
the ball at that right back that's got
to<00:03:19.860> stop<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.220> cross<00:03:20.400> he's<00:03:20.550> got<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.790> make<00:03:20.940> sure

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
to stop the cross he's got to make sure

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.580 
to stop the cross he's got to make sure
that<00:03:21.240> those<00:03:21.360> balls<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:21.959> come<00:03:22.110> into<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> box

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
that those balls don't come into the box
