00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 They are very good to everyone if you are going to like 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.910
 doing the aerobic battle to be able 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.340
 win some did some points 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.710
 commands is the first the first size 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.940
 dedicates the first chapter of just 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.940
 I start with this and I think I'm not going to 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.930
 can continue it because 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.150
 they will see in the children they are alive 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.890
 is here defense in the problem 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.890
 let's look for captain america 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 no this 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.720
 is not in front of everything is the first of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.500
 the characters until today has attack and 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.500
 defense the truth 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 we're going to change it, you're going to put 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 same cal with 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.450
 yes yes let's quietly put no 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.960
 nothing happens here is fine 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.660
 good good good 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.430
 their children are of low level they are 151 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.700
 Now I have to change them. I'm going to 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.390
 put those 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.390
 life attack and defense we are going to put 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 ready 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.100
 Let's fight this is the truth 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.200
 I say that this area sees that it came out 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.880
 bad because I did not put them on yes because 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.189
 I did not know people did but 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.409
 I know who focus already on this is not 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 something so hard to be rich screen 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.270
 but it's worth trying 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.020
 well let's start focus going 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.030
 s 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.640
 the ball cm 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.200
 since it is already we put stripe 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.490
 practically in a hemorrhage and good 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.920
 it will not cause enough problems and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.940
 after the second one is going to be bypass going 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.409
 to be going to go well because it is also 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.850
 another that makes us moral and can 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.520
 cause many problems although I have 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.320
 only one turn 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.880
 now they're going to see what the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.880
 cordial hemorrhage 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.680
 good critical you put me 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.250
 we are going to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.960
 make him focus 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.950
 we said to bronzino whistle if it is not 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.630
 happy he can not counterattack 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.069
 let's start with several earthquakes already 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.849
 that counterattacks us good 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.849
 bomb 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.200
 from there Baron Simon dies 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.650
 but they healed the boys are healed 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.020
 is about to die 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.910
 I hope it was good for me 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.750
 I'm already with this he died 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:56.670
 hemorrhage bleeding, exhausted 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.670
 stun of spear that would be home 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.989
 when we step on him stun 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.670
 let's take advantage of the disadvantage that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.170
 I just realized that they are vulnerable 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.090
 the stunning these characters 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.099
 totally vulnerable to stunning or 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.000
 it can be bored easily to 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.410
 against everyone 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.960
 it is not very difficult of this battle 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.519
 heroic I think I will win if all 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.620
 It goes very well if you keep drawing elusive 2 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.780
 I'm going to do'll do the will 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.500
 do very well 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.500
 attacked 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.849
 all right 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.730
 taking 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.420
 stun vulnerable to stunning 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 how 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.870
 he loses his turn very well very well 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.370
 let's see what we're going to do epiphany to 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.230
 have a critical attack in the next blow 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.060
 I really do not have gloves, it's one of the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.060
 crap is this 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.459
 we'll see 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.579
 you are in my life 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.579
 can kill you 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.910
 I suppose so 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.270
 37 of libraries Maurice with the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.270
 counterattack 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.070
 good 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.270
 great great we win but compete in 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.920
 the doctor died almost the beginning of the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.240
 fight to the middle of the fight 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.819
 we won peruvians 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.949
 are answering steam for being this 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.949
 video that will touch us 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.270
 to pure trash my god does not matter 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.170
 it does not matter 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.030
 and the voice starts with agile gives you 50% for 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.930
 attack wound for me the distance 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.300
 very interesting very interesting good not 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.370
 it matters the captain's and the law fell 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.470
 Take the first turn at the beginning of the game 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.430
 this is not something very much the same as 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.430
 let's say but it does not matter 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.819
 before I want to tell you that you can not 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:12.689
 continue with this I will continue 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:16.000

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.910
 help call unfortunately 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.990
 I started today without any 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.280
 call help to put together 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.450

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.370

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:33.830
