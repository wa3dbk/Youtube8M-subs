it<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.540> bit<00:01:35.930> disappointing<00:01:40.780> all<00:01:41.780> right

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
it is a bit disappointing all right

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.560 
it is a bit disappointing all right
so<00:01:42.440> onto<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.950> actual<00:01:43.130> figures<00:01:43.730> themselves

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
so onto the actual figures themselves

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.620 
so onto the actual figures themselves
we'll<00:01:44.930> start<00:01:45.320> with<00:01:45.620> Hawkman<00:01:46.270> now<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.300> don't

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
we'll start with Hawkman now I don't

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.110 
we'll start with Hawkman now I don't
have<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.350> original<00:01:48.980> release<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.400> Hawkman<00:01:49.850> so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
have the original release of Hawkman so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.660 
have the original release of Hawkman so
I'm<00:01:50.240> not<00:01:50.420> entirely<00:01:50.930> sure<00:01:51.280> but<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.400> not

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
I'm not entirely sure but I do not

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.190 
I'm not entirely sure but I do not
believe<00:01:52.730> that<00:01:53.030> there<00:01:53.390> are<00:01:53.570> any<00:01:53.840> differences

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
believe that there are any differences

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.010 
believe that there are any differences
on<00:01:54.650> this<00:01:54.950> version<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.610> character<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:56.240> will

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
on this version of the character I will

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.310 
on this version of the character I will
say<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.680> though<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.880> one<00:01:59.320> incredibly

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
articulated in several places so that

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.530

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
difference this time is on the armor and

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.860 
difference this time is on the armor and
the<00:02:44.870> wings<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.670> colors<00:02:47.060> are<00:02:47.209> reversed<00:02:47.360> from

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the wings the colors are reversed from

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.720 
the wings the colors are reversed from
the<00:02:48.050> first<00:02:48.380> version<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> figure<00:02:49.310> this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the first version of the figure this

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.610 
the first version of the figure this
time<00:02:50.030> featuring<00:02:50.300> red<00:02:50.780> armor<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.440> blue<00:02:52.130> wings

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
time featuring red armor and blue wings

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.140 
time featuring red armor and blue wings
now<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.680> reason<00:02:55.130> for<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.580> because<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
now the reason for this is because the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.850 
now the reason for this is because the
vintage<00:02:56.540> figure<00:02:56.959> actually<00:02:57.470> had<00:02:57.680> these

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
vintage figure actually had these

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.310 
vintage figure actually had these
different<00:02:58.310> colors<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.880> fact<00:02:59.600> my<00:02:59.870> vintage

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
different colors in fact my vintage

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.590 
different colors in fact my vintage
Stratos<00:03:00.800> sports<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.820> red<00:03:02.000> armor<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.510> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
Stratos sports the red armor and the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.449 
Stratos sports the red armor and the
blue<00:03:02.810> wings<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.470> like<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:03.890> version<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
blue wings just like this version of the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.449 
blue wings just like this version of the
figure<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.080> honestly<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.380> prefer<00:03:07.040> this

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
figure and honestly I prefer this

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:17.050 
figure and honestly I prefer this
version<00:03:14.440> now<00:03:15.440> another<00:03:15.680> great<00:03:16.070> improvement<00:03:16.850> is

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
version now another great improvement is

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.449 
version now another great improvement is
that<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.540> wings<00:03:17.780> are<00:03:18.080> no<00:03:18.380> longer<00:03:18.830> glued<00:03:19.280> in

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
that the wings are no longer glued in

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.900 
that the wings are no longer glued in
place<00:03:20.110> they<00:03:21.110> can<00:03:21.320> now<00:03:21.470> freely<00:03:21.890> rotate<00:03:22.580> around

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
place they can now freely rotate around

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.699 
place they can now freely rotate around
his<00:03:23.150> wrists<00:03:23.630> allowing<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.350> be<00:03:24.470> able<00:03:24.560> to

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
his wrists allowing you to be able to

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.440 
his wrists allowing you to be able to
position<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.280> wings<00:03:25.459> wherever<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.090> need<00:03:26.300> to

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
position the wings wherever you need to

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.710 
position the wings wherever you need to
depending<00:03:27.170> on<00:03:27.350> how<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.620> pose<00:03:27.950> his<00:03:28.160> arms<00:03:28.720> this

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
depending on how you pose his arms this

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.490 
depending on how you pose his arms this
was<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.410> much-needed<00:03:31.120> correction<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:33.230> glued

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
was a much-needed correction the glued

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.830 
was a much-needed correction the glued
wings<00:03:33.770> really<00:03:34.340> limited<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.090> display<00:03:35.480> options

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
wings really limited the display options

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.020 
wings really limited the display options
with<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.080> first<00:03:36.350> Stratos<00:03:36.740> so<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.910> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
with the first Stratos so this is a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:51.220 
with the first Stratos so this is a
welcome<00:03:38.330> change<00:03:47.140> in<00:03:49.360> my<00:03:50.360> opinion<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:50.990> a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
welcome change in my opinion this is a

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.280 
welcome change in my opinion this is a
really<00:03:52.010> good<00:03:52.220> 2-pack<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.880> get<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> hold<00:03:53.270> of<00:03:53.390> the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
really good 2-pack to get a hold of the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.170 
really good 2-pack to get a hold of the
Stratos<00:03:54.710> that<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:54.980> included<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.550> my<00:03:55.700> opinion

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
Stratos that is included in my opinion

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.100 
Stratos that is included in my opinion
is<00:03:56.330> superior<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.319> his<00:03:57.500> initial<00:03:57.740> release<00:03:59.110> both

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
is superior to his initial release both

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.380 
is superior to his initial release both
with<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.530> new<00:04:00.770> colors<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.880> new<00:04:02.060> wing

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
with the new colors and that new wing

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.770 
with the new colors and that new wing
articulation<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.130> alone<00:04:04.550> is<00:04:04.880> worth<00:04:04.940> it

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
articulation and that alone is worth it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.990 
articulation and that alone is worth it
and<00:04:06.050> if<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.709> don't<00:04:06.890> already<00:04:07.190> own<00:04:07.370> Hawkman

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
and if you don't already own Hawkman

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.199 
and if you don't already own Hawkman
then<00:04:08.240> he's<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:09.170> an<00:04:09.319> impressive<00:04:10.280> bonus<00:04:10.790> to

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
then he's just an impressive bonus to

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.630 
then he's just an impressive bonus to
get<00:04:11.330> along<00:04:11.600> with<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:11.870> Stratos<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:15.640> Hawkman
