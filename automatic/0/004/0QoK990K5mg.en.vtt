hour so all of a sudden everything has

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
hour so all of a sudden everything has

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to become very robust most the time when

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.060 
to become very robust most the time when
that<00:00:54.899> means<00:00:55.079> robust<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> means<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that means robust that means that you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
that means robust that means that you
actually<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> unique<00:00:56.760> component<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.420> part

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
actually have a unique component or part
in<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> platform<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in there so the platform is just the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
in there so the platform is just the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
starting point and reason why it's so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
starting point and reason why it's so
valuable<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.000> platform

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
valuable for for to use one platform

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
valuable for for to use one platform
