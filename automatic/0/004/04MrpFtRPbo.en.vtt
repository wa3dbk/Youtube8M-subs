00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
thing is I have not been hell out of

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.390 
thing is I have not been hell out of
these<00:00:22.690> cars<00:00:22.900> on<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.260> track<00:00:23.500> before<00:00:23.740> either<00:00:24.070> so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
these cars on a track before either so

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.160 
these cars on a track before either so
it's<00:00:24.520> kind<00:00:24.790> of<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.970> double<00:00:25.270> negative<00:00:25.420> but<00:00:25.810> you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
it's kind of a double negative but you

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.499 
it's kind of a double negative but you
have<00:00:26.439> to<00:00:26.590> be<00:00:26.710> really<00:00:27.040> quick<00:00:27.340> to<00:00:27.910> get<00:00:28.060> used<00:00:28.330> to

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
have to be really quick to get used to

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.530 
have to be really quick to get used to
the<00:00:28.660> car<00:00:29.430> getting<00:00:30.430> out<00:00:30.580> there<00:00:30.849> you<00:00:31.300> have<00:00:31.419> to

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
the car getting out there you have to

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.020 
the car getting out there you have to
make<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.810> most<00:00:31.989> of<00:00:32.200> it<00:00:32.349> because<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.790> third

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
make the most of it because the third

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.970 
make the most of it because the third
thing<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:34.810> only<00:00:34.960> get<00:00:35.200> one<00:00:35.380> lap<00:00:35.649> and<00:00:35.890> it's

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
thing is you only get one lap and it's

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.220 
thing is you only get one lap and it's
not<00:00:36.160> even<00:00:36.310> a<00:00:36.489> full<00:00:36.760> lap<00:00:36.970> if<00:00:37.270> that<00:00:37.570> if<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.899> wanted

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
not even a full lap if that if I wanted

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.510 
not even a full lap if that if I wanted
to<00:00:38.290> get<00:00:38.470> in<00:00:38.590> every<00:00:38.800> car<00:00:39.040> which<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.250> what<00:00:39.489> I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
to get in every car which is what I

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.400 
to get in every car which is what I
tried<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.910> do<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.060> just<00:00:40.329> didn't<00:00:40.540> hammer<00:00:40.780> one<00:00:41.110> car

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
tried to do I just didn't hammer one car

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.200 
tried to do I just didn't hammer one car
over<00:00:41.680> and<00:00:41.829> over<00:00:42.040> again<00:00:42.130> I<00:00:42.280> got<00:00:42.460> one<00:00:42.730> lap<00:00:42.970> and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
over and over again I got one lap and

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.200 
over and over again I got one lap and
each<00:00:43.300> car<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.809> tested<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.970> thing

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
each car that I tested and the thing

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.740 
each car that I tested and the thing
with<00:00:46.390> that<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.809> makes<00:00:47.590> it<00:00:47.710> difficult<00:00:48.750> very

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
with that is makes it difficult very

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.569 
with that is makes it difficult very
difficult<00:00:50.289> because<00:00:50.649> most<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.460> the

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
difficult because most of the

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.160 
difficult because most of the
journalists<00:00:52.000> there<00:00:52.179> they<00:00:52.480> don't<00:00:52.660> do<00:00:52.839> video

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
journalists there they don't do video

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.590 
journalists there they don't do video
they<00:00:53.589> just<00:00:53.800> drive<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.460> had<00:00:54.760> fun<00:00:55.059> maybe<00:00:55.390> they'll

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
they just drive it had fun maybe they'll

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.360 
they just drive it had fun maybe they'll
write<00:00:55.780> about<00:00:55.989> it<00:00:56.170> maybe<00:00:56.320> they<00:00:56.500> won't<00:00:56.679> but<00:00:56.920> for

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
write about it maybe they won't but for

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.660 
write about it maybe they won't but for
me<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:59.050> way<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.199> like<00:00:59.469> to<00:00:59.499> do<00:00:59.679> video<00:00:59.980> it's<00:01:00.429> not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
me the way I like to do video it's not

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.639 
me the way I like to do video it's not
conducive<00:01:00.910> for<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:01.809> got<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.050> get<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.320> set

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
conducive for that you got to get in set

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.320 
conducive for that you got to get in set
it<00:01:02.679> up<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.339> know<00:01:03.429> less<00:01:03.850> than<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:04.120> minute

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
it up and you know less than a minute

get audio and video for each car the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.210 
get audio and video for each car the
next<00:01:12.550> thing<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.150> they<00:01:14.140> put<00:01:14.710> cones<00:01:14.950> on<00:01:15.190> the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
next thing is they put cones on the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.370 
next thing is they put cones on the
track<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.909> break<00:01:16.090> up<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.420> straights<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.200> I'm

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
track to break up the straights and I'm

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.139 
track to break up the straights and I'm
gonna<00:01:17.500> say<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.040> every<00:01:18.159> video<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:19.119> put

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
gonna say this in every video they put

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.359 
gonna say this in every video they put
these<00:01:19.720> cones<00:01:20.079> to<00:01:20.439> slow<00:01:20.740> down<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.130> cars

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
these cones to slow down the cars

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.120 
these cones to slow down the cars
because<00:01:21.820> these<00:01:22.119> are<00:01:22.390> street<00:01:22.840> cars<00:01:23.140> on<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.740> track

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
because these are street cars on a track

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.130 
because these are street cars on a track
that<00:01:24.189> is<00:01:24.460> horrific<00:01:24.610> on<00:01:25.119> brakes<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:25.960> if<00:01:26.049> they

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that is horrific on brakes so if they

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.690 
that is horrific on brakes so if they
wouldn't<00:01:26.380> put<00:01:26.590> those<00:01:26.680> cones<00:01:27.040> up<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.250> break<00:01:27.549> up

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
wouldn't put those cones up to break up

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.460 
wouldn't put those cones up to break up
the<00:01:27.820> straight-line<00:01:28.270> speed<00:01:28.479> you'd<00:01:29.290> have

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
the straight-line speed you'd have

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.380 
the straight-line speed you'd have
people<00:01:29.619> crashing<00:01:30.250> losing<00:01:30.549> brakes<00:01:30.850> or<00:01:31.149> you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
people crashing losing brakes or you

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.630 
people crashing losing brakes or you
know<00:01:31.630> even<00:01:31.659> worse<00:01:32.200> they<00:01:33.009> didn't<00:01:33.310> want<00:01:33.520> you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
know even worse they didn't want you

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
cameras on the track to kind of monitor

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.560 
cameras on the track to kind of monitor
that<00:01:38.860> they<00:01:39.340> didn't<00:01:39.549> want<00:01:39.700> any<00:01:39.880> drifting<00:01:40.390> which

that they didn't want any drifting which

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.789 
that they didn't want any drifting which
you<00:01:40.659> shouldn't<00:01:40.990> be<00:01:41.049> doing<00:01:41.140> on<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> road<00:01:41.560> course

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
you shouldn't be doing on a road course

you shouldn't be doing on a road course
anyway<00:01:42.219> they<00:01:42.820> wanted<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.719> rate<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:44.140> know

drive cleanly within the limits and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.330 
drive cleanly within the limits and
you'll<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.229> lot<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.560> my<00:01:47.740> driving<00:01:48.070> is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
you'll see a lot of my driving is

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.940 
you'll see a lot of my driving is
probably<00:01:49.030> seven<00:01:49.509> eight<00:01:49.750> tenths<00:01:50.079> in<00:01:50.409> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
probably seven eight tenths in the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.709 
probably seven eight tenths in the
special<00:01:51.700> in<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:51.880> cars<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.210> wasn't<00:01:52.539> comfortable

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
special in the cars I wasn't comfortable

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.660 
special in the cars I wasn't comfortable
in<00:01:53.049> now<00:01:53.560> there<00:01:53.770> are<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> couple<00:01:54.039> cars<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.640> I

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
in now there are a couple cars that I

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.160 
in now there are a couple cars that I
really<00:01:55.090> loved<00:01:55.329> and<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.539> was<00:01:55.659> able<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.930> push<00:01:56.140> a

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
really loved and I was able to push a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.170 
really loved and I was able to push a
lot<00:01:56.380> harder<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:56.799> again<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.520> won't<00:01:57.700> see<00:01:58.000> me

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
lot harder but again you won't see me

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.840 
lot harder but again you won't see me
going<00:01:58.359> completely<00:01:58.750> flat<00:01:59.439> out<00:01:59.649> but<00:02:00.280> you'll<00:02:00.670> get

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
going completely flat out but you'll get

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.060 
going completely flat out but you'll get
a<00:02:00.880> good<00:02:01.119> feel<00:02:01.359> for<00:02:01.390> what<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.810> car<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.079> like

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.859 

so<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.160> first<00:02:09.340> car<00:02:09.550> got<00:02:09.759> into<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.780> I

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
so the first car got into that I

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.820 
so the first car got into that I
actually<00:02:11.020> did<00:02:11.440> video<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.950> was<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.550> Kia<00:02:12.970> Forte

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

SX 5-door Walt's hatch with a turbo and
I<00:02:18.670> wanted<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> get<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.390> car<00:02:19.630> right<00:02:19.660> away

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
I wanted to get in this car right away

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.750 
I wanted to get in this car right away
because<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.470> was<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> good<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.280> know<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.670> not

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
because it was a good you know it's not

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760 
because it was a good you know it's not
intimidating<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.200> know<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.410> not<00:02:23.560> high

intimidating and you know it's not high
speed<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.970> let's<00:02:25.630> take<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> lap<00:02:26.050> in<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.380> and

speed so let's take a lap in that and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:39.520 
speed so let's take a lap in that and
see<00:02:26.620> how<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.800> works<00:02:27.070> out

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530

weird under braking but on the street
it'd<00:05:51.990> be<00:05:52.140> really<00:05:52.350> confident

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.920 

so<00:05:59.430> now<00:05:59.550> I'm<00:05:59.759> done<00:05:59.940> with<00:06:00.000> this<00:06:00.300> lap<00:06:00.539> and<00:06:00.750> you

so now I'm done with this lap and you

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.170 
so now I'm done with this lap and you
can<00:06:01.560> tell<00:06:01.800> probably<00:06:02.009> from<00:06:02.310> my<00:06:02.400> reaction<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:03.120> I

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
can tell probably from my reaction and I

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.760 
can tell probably from my reaction and I
don't<00:06:03.240> do<00:06:03.569> a<00:06:03.599> lot<00:06:03.690> of<00:06:03.930> commentary<00:06:04.349> when<00:06:04.650> I'm

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
don't do a lot of commentary when I'm

don't do a lot of commentary when I'm
driving<00:06:04.979> on<00:06:05.190> a<00:06:05.250> track<00:06:05.520> but<00:06:05.550> I<00:06:05.940> was<00:06:06.389> really

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
driving on a track but I was really

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.290 
driving on a track but I was really
surprised<00:06:07.050> by<00:06:07.289> how<00:06:07.490> sorted<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.759> suspension

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
surprised by how sorted the suspension

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.529 
surprised by how sorted the suspension
of<00:06:09.389> this<00:06:09.509> car<00:06:09.720> was<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:10.139> didn't<00:06:10.349> have<00:06:10.440> a<00:06:10.500> lot<00:06:10.620> of

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
of this car was it didn't have a lot of

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.879 
of this car was it didn't have a lot of
understeer<00:06:12.539> I<00:06:12.599> mean<00:06:12.870> it<00:06:12.990> would<00:06:13.110> under<00:06:13.620> steered

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
understeer I mean it would under steered

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.559 
understeer I mean it would under steered
of<00:06:14.009> course<00:06:14.220> but<00:06:14.430> it<00:06:14.520> wasn't<00:06:14.759> like<00:06:14.879> horrific

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
of course but it wasn't like horrific

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.719 
of course but it wasn't like horrific
you<00:06:16.080> know<00:06:16.169> it<00:06:16.889> didn't<00:06:17.129> have<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.280> lot<00:06:17.400> of<00:06:17.520> torque

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
you know it didn't have a lot of torque

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.180 
you know it didn't have a lot of torque
steer<00:06:18.030> it<00:06:18.210> felt<00:06:18.419> really<00:06:18.599> balanced<00:06:19.289> and<00:06:19.889> I<00:06:20.069> was

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
steer it felt really balanced and I was

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.580 
steer it felt really balanced and I was
surprised<00:06:20.490> by<00:06:20.669> the<00:06:20.729> power<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.389> how<00:06:22.080> well<00:06:22.319> the

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
surprised by the power and how well the

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.980 
surprised by the power and how well the
brakes<00:06:22.830> felt<00:06:23.159> to<00:06:23.909> a<00:06:23.940> certain<00:06:24.270> point<00:06:24.479> obviously

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
brakes felt to a certain point obviously

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.240 
brakes felt to a certain point obviously
they<00:06:25.110> started<00:06:25.440> to<00:06:25.500> fade<00:06:25.710> on<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.889> track<00:06:26.220> like

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
they started to fade on a track like

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.520 
they started to fade on a track like
this<00:06:26.639> but<00:06:26.849> on<00:06:26.879> the<00:06:27.060> street<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:27.930> it's<00:06:28.259> got<00:06:28.500> a

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
this but on the street that it's got a

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.409 
this but on the street that it's got a
really<00:06:28.770> solid<00:06:29.099> brake<00:06:29.520> pedal<00:06:29.940> feel<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.330> it's

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
really solid brake pedal feel and it's

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.820 
really solid brake pedal feel and it's
one<00:06:30.599> of<00:06:30.630> those<00:06:30.810> false<00:06:31.199> sense<00:06:31.500> of<00:06:31.650> confidence

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
one of those false sense of confidence

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.129 
one of those false sense of confidence
type<00:06:32.430> things<00:06:32.699> but<00:06:33.150> on<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.360> street<00:06:33.720> this<00:06:33.960> would

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
type things but on the street this would

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.040 
type things but on the street this would
be<00:06:34.289> a<00:06:34.319> really<00:06:34.650> good<00:06:34.919> car<00:06:35.569> from<00:06:36.569> a<00:06:36.630> driving

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
be a really good car from a driving

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.360 
be a really good car from a driving
perspective<00:06:37.229> it's<00:06:37.710> got<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:37.979> power<00:06:38.159> and

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
perspective it's got the power and

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.890 
perspective it's got the power and
torque<00:06:38.520> where<00:06:38.759> you<00:06:38.849> want<00:06:39.060> it<00:06:39.180> down<00:06:39.300> low

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
torque where you want it down low

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.930 
torque where you want it down low
doesn't<00:06:40.770> torque<00:06:40.949> steer<00:06:41.190> handles<00:06:41.520> good<00:06:41.699> and

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
doesn't torque steer handles good and

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.089 
doesn't torque steer handles good and
under<00:06:42.270> steers<00:06:42.509> not<00:06:42.720> not<00:06:43.139> that<00:06:43.289> aggressive<00:06:43.530> so

under steers not not that aggressive so

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.550 
under steers not not that aggressive so
I<00:06:44.370> was<00:06:45.030> really<00:06:45.389> surprised<00:06:45.780> with<00:06:45.930> this<00:06:46.139> car<00:06:46.349> and

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
I was really surprised with this car and
