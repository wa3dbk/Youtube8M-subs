I<00:00:00.350> want<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.469> talk<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:01.740> some<00:00:02.040> complications

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
I want to talk about some complications

of cystic fibrosis that don't seem as
intuitive<00:00:05.879> everybody<00:00:06.779> thinks<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.200> CF<00:00:07.529> as

intuitive everybody thinks of CF as

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.759 
intuitive everybody thinks of CF as
mostly<00:00:08.700> thick<00:00:09.660> mucus<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.230> lungs

channel<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.720> working<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.289> want<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> talk<00:00:26.099> about

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
channel not working I want to talk about

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.670 
channel not working I want to talk about
three<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.119> let's<00:00:28.019> start<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
three of these and let's start with the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
three of these and let's start with the
issue<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.090> infertility<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.890> actually

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
issue of infertility this actually

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.270 
issue of infertility this actually
affects<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.600> was<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.050> most<00:00:34.320> CF<00:00:34.800> patients

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
affects a lot I was in most CF patients

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.850 
affects a lot I was in most CF patients
up<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.850> 98%<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> men<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.530> infertile

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
up to 98% of the men can be infertile

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.680 
up to 98% of the men can be infertile
and<00:00:38.160> men<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.820> women<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.210> different<00:00:39.329> reasons

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and men and women have different reasons

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.740 
and men and women have different reasons
but<00:00:40.079> let's<00:00:40.440> look<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:40.739> men<00:00:40.950> first<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.510> men

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
but let's look at men first so for men

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
but let's look at men first so for men
the<00:00:43.110> reason<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.910> tend<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> be

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the reason that they are they tend to be

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.540 
the reason that they are they tend to be
infertile<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.800> absence<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
infertile is because of an absence of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.630 
infertile is because of an absence of
these<00:00:47.910> tubes<00:00:48.270> called<00:00:49.020> vas<00:00:49.530> deferens<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.469> vas

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
these tubes called vas deferens so vas

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.540 
these tubes called vas deferens so vas
deferens<00:00:53.960> it's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> funny<00:00:55.289> word<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> describe<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
deferens it's a funny word to describe a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
deferens it's a funny word to describe a
specific<00:00:57.300> set<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> tubes<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> male

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
specific set of tubes in the male

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
specific set of tubes in the male
reproductive<00:00:58.949> system<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.510> were<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> draw

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
reproductive system so if I were to draw

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.399 
reproductive system so if I were to draw
it<00:01:01.020> let's<00:01:01.829> put<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> testes<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
it let's put the testes down here and

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
it let's put the testes down here and
sperm<00:01:04.409> begins<00:01:04.860> their<00:01:05.040> life<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.390> as

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sperm begins their life down here but as

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
sperm begins their life down here but as
they're<00:01:07.200> maturing<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
they're maturing and they get to have to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.270 
they're maturing and they get to have to
be<00:01:08.850> transferred<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:10.200> tubes<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:11.220> are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
be transferred up these tubes that are

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
be transferred up these tubes that are
connected<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> testes<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.080> transfer

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
connected to the testes that transfer

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
connected to the testes that transfer
the<00:01:13.740> sperm<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> allow<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> mature<00:01:15.210> these

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the sperm and allow them to mature these

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.149 
the sperm and allow them to mature these
are<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> vas<00:01:16.710> deferens<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:18.180> CF<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.560> 98%

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
are the vas deferens and in CF up to 98%

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.359 
are the vas deferens and in CF up to 98%
of<00:01:20.580> men<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.979> condition

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
of men don't have this in this condition

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.149 
of men don't have this in this condition
is<00:01:23.460> called<00:01:23.670> vas<00:01:23.909> deferens<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> Genesis<00:01:25.560> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is called vas deferens a Genesis so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.960 
is called vas deferens a Genesis so
Genesis<00:01:26.909> means<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.540> generate<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.549> Genesis

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
Genesis means to generate and a Genesis

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.969 
Genesis means to generate and a Genesis
just<00:01:30.240> means<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.600> doesn't<00:01:30.869> develop<00:01:31.350> these

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
just means it doesn't develop these

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
just means it doesn't develop these
babies<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> womb<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.150> thick<00:01:33.780> mucus

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
babies are in the womb the thick mucus

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
babies are in the womb the thick mucus
here<00:01:34.500> clogs<00:01:34.890> off<00:01:35.130> these<00:01:35.369> tubes<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> they

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
here clogs off these tubes and they

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
here clogs off these tubes and they
don't<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.689> ever<00:01:37.229> develop<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.430> have

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
don't actually ever develop so we have

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.520 
don't actually ever develop so we have
vas<00:01:38.820> deferens<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> Genesis<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> reason

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
vas deferens a Genesis that's the reason

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
vas deferens a Genesis that's the reason
for<00:01:40.560> male<00:01:40.979> infertility<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.689> sperm

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
for male infertility because the sperm

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.319 
for male infertility because the sperm
can't<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> where<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.549> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
can't go to where they need to go and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.880 
can't go to where they need to go and
the<00:01:45.780> camera<00:01:46.110> tour<00:01:46.350> without<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> best

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the camera tour without the best

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
the camera tour without the best
efference<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.700> basically<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.810> have

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
efference so basically we don't have

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.649 
efference so basically we don't have
sperm<00:01:49.439> production<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:50.939> females<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sperm production here so for females of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
sperm production here so for females of
course<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> reason<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.770> completely

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
course the reason is completely

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.450 
course the reason is completely
different<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> could<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:54.930> draw<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.460> female

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
different I could just draw the female

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.109 
different I could just draw the female
system<00:01:56.729> when<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.149> quickly<00:01:58.850> I'm<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.060> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
system when they quickly I'm going to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.389 
system when they quickly I'm going to
draw<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> cervix<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
draw like this so here is the cervix and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.840 
draw like this so here is the cervix and
up<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> uterus<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.710> over<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.640> are

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
up here is the uterus and over here are

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.350 
up here is the uterus and over here are
the<00:02:06.750> ovaries<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.399> sperm<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> get<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.119> here

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the ovaries so for sperm to get up here

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
the ovaries so for sperm to get up here
to<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:10.020> impregnate<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.920> woman<00:02:11.250> has<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> go

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to to impregnate this woman has to go

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.030 
to to impregnate this woman has to go
through<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> cervix<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:13.290> have

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
through the cervix we have

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.550 
through the cervix we have
mucus<00:02:14.549> here<00:02:14.909> due<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.260> different

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
mucus here due to this is different

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.890 
mucus here due to this is different
processes<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> lot<00:02:17.909> of<00:02:18.030> sperm<00:02:18.329> doesn't<00:02:18.659> get

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
processes so a lot of sperm doesn't get

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.770 
processes so a lot of sperm doesn't get
through<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.700> for<00:02:20.700> females<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.120> produce<00:02:21.540> eggs

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
through and for females to produce eggs

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.380 
through and for females to produce eggs
and<00:02:22.049> be<00:02:22.140> fertile<00:02:22.500> nutrition<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.610> important<00:02:24.180> so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and be fertile nutrition is important so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.509 
and be fertile nutrition is important so
the<00:02:24.629> actual<00:02:25.200> underlying<00:02:25.530> nutrition<00:02:26.159> problem

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
the actual underlying nutrition problem

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.179 
the actual underlying nutrition problem
in<00:02:26.700> CF<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.599> lead<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.200> female<00:02:28.560> infertility<00:02:28.799> as

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
in CF can lead to female infertility as

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.770 
in CF can lead to female infertility as
well<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.299> they're<00:02:30.450> still<00:02:30.569> producing

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
well so here they're still producing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.869 
well so here they're still producing
eggs<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.440> able<00:02:31.829> to<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.040> pregnant<00:02:32.250> but

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
eggs are able to get pregnant but

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.390 
eggs are able to get pregnant but
technically<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.599> difficult<00:02:34.129> but<00:02:35.129> keep<00:02:35.280> in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
technically it is difficult but keep in

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520 
technically it is difficult but keep in
mind<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.760> even<00:02:36.180> though<00:02:36.360> CF<00:02:36.840> patients<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.409> be

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
mind that even though CF patients can be

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.170 
mind that even though CF patients can be
infertile<00:02:38.069> meaning<00:02:38.519> it's<00:02:38.760> hard<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> get

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
infertile meaning it's hard to get

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
infertile meaning it's hard to get
pregnant<00:02:39.360> or<00:02:39.659> they<00:02:40.140> can't<00:02:40.349> get<00:02:40.440> pregnant<00:02:40.590> on

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
pregnant or they can't get pregnant on

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.970 
pregnant or they can't get pregnant on
their<00:02:41.040> own<00:02:41.250> they<00:02:42.000> are<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.769> sterile

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
their own they are not sterile

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
their own they are not sterile
so<00:02:44.909> being<00:02:45.359> sterile<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:46.019> mean<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.319> they

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so being sterile would mean that they

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.580 
so being sterile would mean that they
can't<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:47.280> children<00:02:47.310> even<00:02:47.970> with

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
can't have children even with

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.259 
can't have children even with
infertility<00:02:49.590> treatments<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.060> case

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
infertility treatments but in this case

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.899 
infertility treatments but in this case
they<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.680> artificially<00:02:52.920> put<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
they can we can artificially put the

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.660 
they can we can artificially put the
embryo<00:02:54.840> into<00:02:55.109> this<00:02:55.500> woman's<00:02:55.769> uterus<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
embryo into this woman's uterus and it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.309 
embryo into this woman's uterus and it
can<00:02:56.819> grow<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.239> or<00:02:57.450> for<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> men<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.019> can

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
can grow there or for the men we can

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.309 
can grow there or for the men we can
artificially<00:02:58.680> extract<00:02:59.670> his<00:02:59.849> sperm<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.079> people

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
artificially extract his sperm so people

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.379 
artificially extract his sperm so people
would<00:03:01.440> see<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:02.040> can't<00:03:02.370> reproduce<00:03:02.700> but

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
would see if they can't reproduce but

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.819 
would see if they can't reproduce but
usually<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:03.870> without<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:04.709> of

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
usually not without some kind of

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.250 
usually not without some kind of
reproductive<00:03:05.280> therapy<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.659> for<00:03:06.870> women<00:03:07.019> with

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
reproductive therapy and for women with

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.080 
reproductive therapy and for women with
CF<00:03:07.500> actually<00:03:07.859> it's<00:03:07.980> difficult<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.790> carry<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
CF actually it's difficult to carry a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.360 
CF actually it's difficult to carry a
baby<00:03:09.239> sometimes<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:10.109> again<00:03:10.440> nutrition<00:03:11.340> a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
baby sometimes because again nutrition a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.369 
baby sometimes because again nutrition a
lot<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.700> those<00:03:11.879> other<00:03:12.299> complications<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.109> CF

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
lot of those other complications of CF

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.830 
lot of those other complications of CF
come<00:03:13.590> into<00:03:13.859> play<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:14.819> that's<00:03:15.000> infertility<00:03:15.420> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
come into play so that's infertility and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.569 
come into play so that's infertility and
I<00:03:16.019> don't<00:03:16.139> know<00:03:16.200> about<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.980> wouldn't

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
I don't know about you but I wouldn't

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.069 
I don't know about you but I wouldn't
have<00:03:17.700> expected<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.419> be<00:03:18.540> part<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.930> this

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
have expected this to be part of this

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.170 
have expected this to be part of this
spectrum<00:03:19.379> of<00:03:19.590> disease<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.250> obviously<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.150> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
spectrum of disease but obviously it's a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.539 
spectrum of disease but obviously it's a
huge<00:03:21.419> part<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.780> their<00:03:22.049> life<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.310> next

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
huge part of their life and the next

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.039 
huge part of their life and the next
thing<00:03:23.699> I<00:03:23.760> want<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.940> talk<00:03:24.090> about<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.660> guess

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
thing I want to talk about I guess

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.170 
thing I want to talk about I guess
belongs<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.859> family<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.220> GI<00:03:26.549> or<00:03:26.879> gut

belongs to the family of GI or gut

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.610 
belongs to the family of GI or gut
complications<00:03:28.169> it's<00:03:28.379> called

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
complications it's called

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.849 
complications it's called
intussusception<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:30.109> it's<00:03:31.109> even<00:03:31.440> harder<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
intussusception and it's even harder to

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.099 
intussusception and it's even harder to
spell<00:03:32.459> than<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.879> is<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> say<00:03:33.389> so<00:03:33.720> I'm<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.049> to

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
spell than it is to say so I'm going to

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.439 
spell than it is to say so I'm going to
go<00:03:34.680> spell<00:03:34.919> this<00:03:35.040> correctly<00:03:35.359> inta<00:03:37.849> so<00:03:38.849> suction

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
go spell this correctly inta so suction

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.699 
go spell this correctly inta so suction
and<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:41.970> people<00:03:42.959> without<00:03:43.199> CF<00:03:43.500> this

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
and this is in people without CF this

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.420 
and this is in people without CF this
still<00:03:44.129> occurs<00:03:44.579> but<00:03:45.180> mostly<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.660> babies<00:03:46.049> and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
still occurs but mostly in babies and

still occurs but mostly in babies and
people<00:03:47.430> with<00:03:47.549> cystic<00:03:47.819> fibrosis<00:03:47.849> can<00:03:48.419> have

this into adulthood or they can have it

this into adulthood or they can have it
more<00:03:51.150> commonly<00:03:51.599> as<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.959> child<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
more commonly as a child it's a

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.809 
more commonly as a child it's a
mechanical<00:03:53.849> thing<00:03:54.329> in<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.690> gut<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:56.040> think

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
mechanical thing in the gut that I think

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.610 
mechanical thing in the gut that I think
the<00:03:56.909> best<00:03:57.060> way<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.269> describe<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the best way to describe it is if you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.220 
the best way to describe it is if you
can<00:03:58.739> imagine<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.400> telescope<00:04:00.150> one<00:04:01.049> of<00:04:01.139> those

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
can imagine a telescope one of those

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.869 
can imagine a telescope one of those
telescopes<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.829> come<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.190> segments<00:04:02.609> and<00:04:02.760> you

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
telescopes that come in segments and you

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.939 
telescopes that come in segments and you
could<00:04:03.000> open<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.540> one<00:04:04.169> segment<00:04:04.409> after<00:04:04.769> another

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
could open it one segment after another

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.460 
could open it one segment after another
so<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> looking<00:04:06.359> lens<00:04:06.599> then<00:04:07.260> each

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
so this is a looking lens then each

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.300 
so this is a looking lens then each
segment<00:04:08.010> gets<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.250> little<00:04:08.370> smaller<00:04:08.760> like<00:04:10.310> that

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
segment gets a little smaller like that

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.490 
segment gets a little smaller like that
right<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.419> what<00:04:12.629> this<00:04:12.750> helps<00:04:13.049> go<00:04:13.199> fully

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
right this is what this helps go fully

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.920 
right this is what this helps go fully
open<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.400> we<00:04:14.489> need<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:14.790> close<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.359> telescope

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
open so we need to close the telescope

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.899 
open so we need to close the telescope
and<00:04:16.109> take<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.320> home<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:17.099> do<00:04:17.159> you<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.699> that

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
and take it home what do you do is that

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.990 
and take it home what do you do is that
you<00:04:18.000> push<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.479> end<00:04:18.659> here<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.709> way<00:04:19.949> right<00:04:20.729> and

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
you push the end here this way right and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.899 
you push the end here this way right and
it<00:04:21.959> kind<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.169> folds<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.740> on<00:04:22.889> itself<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.550> that's

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
it kind of folds in on itself and that's

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.490 
it kind of folds in on itself and that's
exactly<00:04:24.360> how<00:04:24.539> incomes

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
exactly how incomes

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.940 
exactly how incomes
option<00:04:25.740> happens<00:04:26.160> in<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.580> gut<00:04:26.790> so<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.330> have

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
option happens in the gut so you have

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
option happens in the gut so you have
just<00:04:28.950> going<00:04:29.070> along<00:04:29.340> in<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> guy<00:04:29.610> say<00:04:29.790> we're

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
just going along in the guy say we're

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.090 
just going along in the guy say we're
going<00:04:30.180> from<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.570> small<00:04:30.780> intestine<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:31.590> to

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
going from the small intestine here to

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.050 
going from the small intestine here to
the<00:04:32.220> large<00:04:32.400> intestine<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.580> gut

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
the large intestine and this the gut

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.960 
the large intestine and this the gut
here<00:04:36.330> can<00:04:36.540> suddenly<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:37.050> collapse<00:04:37.440> this<00:04:37.680> way

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
here can suddenly just collapse this way

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.210 
here can suddenly just collapse this way
folding<00:04:38.970> into<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.960> large<00:04:40.170> intestine<00:04:40.230> this

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
folding into the large intestine this

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.130 
folding into the large intestine this
cuts<00:04:41.550> off<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.850> blood<00:04:41.880> supply<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.420> extremely

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
cuts off the blood supply is extremely

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.010 
cuts off the blood supply is extremely
painful<00:04:43.350> babies<00:04:43.950> will<00:04:44.100> cry<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.640> fuss

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
painful babies will cry and fuss

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.210 
painful babies will cry and fuss
sometimes<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.200> reverses<00:04:46.650> itself<00:04:46.950> sometimes

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
sometimes it reverses itself sometimes

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.520 
sometimes it reverses itself sometimes
you<00:04:47.490> use<00:04:47.730> an<00:04:47.910> air<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.390> shoot<00:04:48.810> air<00:04:49.020> into<00:04:49.320> here

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
you use an air you shoot air into here

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.800 
you use an air you shoot air into here
to<00:04:49.710> push<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:50.010> out<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.760> again<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.240> extremely

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
to push it out but again it's extremely

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.780 
to push it out but again it's extremely
rare<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.020> see<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.530> in<00:04:52.740> people<00:04:52.860> after<00:04:53.250> 12

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
rare to see this in people after 12

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.450 
rare to see this in people after 12
but<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.240> cystic<00:04:54.540> fibrosis<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:55.140> happens<00:04:55.530> so

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
but in cystic fibrosis it happens so

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.590 
but in cystic fibrosis it happens so
just<00:04:56.700> something<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.030> watch<00:04:57.060> out<00:04:57.330> for<00:04:57.360> if

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
just something to watch out for if

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.570 
just something to watch out for if
you're<00:04:57.720> treating<00:04:58.050> somebody<00:04:58.560> with<00:04:58.919> CF<00:04:59.310> and

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
you're treating somebody with CF and

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.730 
you're treating somebody with CF and
they<00:04:59.790> suddenly<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.510> abdominal<00:05:00.990> pain<00:05:01.260> this

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
they suddenly have abdominal pain this

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.530 
they suddenly have abdominal pain this
is<00:05:01.860> one<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.760> should<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.120> on<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.360> list

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
is one of the it should be on the list

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.640 
is one of the it should be on the list
of<00:05:03.720> things<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:04.050> think<00:05:04.230> about

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
of things to think about

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.710 
of things to think about
the<00:05:05.250> third<00:05:05.580> complication<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.330> want<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.540> talk

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
the third complication I want to talk

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.800 
the third complication I want to talk
about<00:05:06.840> has<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.169> do<00:05:07.380> with<00:05:07.620> bone<00:05:08.280> density<00:05:08.910> now

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
about has to do with bone density now

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.840 
about has to do with bone density now
you<00:05:09.870> might<00:05:10.110> think<00:05:10.140> what<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:10.919> bone<00:05:11.220> have<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.730> do

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
you might think what is bone have to do

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.780 
you might think what is bone have to do
with<00:05:12.030> chloride<00:05:12.390> channels<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.200> mucus<00:05:13.650> this<00:05:14.580> is

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
with chloride channels and mucus this is

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.760 
with chloride channels and mucus this is
kind<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.270> weird<00:05:15.510> one<00:05:15.690> but<00:05:16.230> most<00:05:16.350> people<00:05:16.680> who

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
kind of a weird one but most people who

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.930 
kind of a weird one but most people who
have<00:05:17.010> cystic<00:05:17.430> fibrosis<00:05:17.460> have<00:05:18.590> osteopenia

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
have cystic fibrosis have osteopenia

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.840 
have cystic fibrosis have osteopenia
osteo<00:05:20.940> so<00:05:21.330> osteo<00:05:21.750> means<00:05:22.169> bone<00:05:22.470> pain<00:05:23.310> ium<00:05:23.550> means

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
osteo so osteo means bone pain ium means

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.720 
osteo so osteo means bone pain ium means
not<00:05:24.450> enough<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.960> or<00:05:25.200> lack<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.730> osteopenia

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
not enough of or lack of osteopenia

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.750 
not enough of or lack of osteopenia
means<00:05:27.120> low<00:05:27.660> bone<00:05:27.990> density<00:05:28.020> now<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:29.370> gets

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
means low bone density now this gets

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.340 
means low bone density now this gets
really<00:05:29.970> bad

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
really bad

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.710 
really bad
it<00:05:31.620> reaches<00:05:32.040> criteria<00:05:32.520> for<00:05:32.640> osteoporosis<00:05:33.150> and

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
it reaches criteria for osteoporosis and

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.200 
it reaches criteria for osteoporosis and
this<00:05:34.260> you've<00:05:34.680> probably<00:05:34.890> heard<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.280> as<00:05:35.550> an<00:05:35.850> old

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
this you've probably heard of as an old

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.390 
this you've probably heard of as an old
people<00:05:36.479> disease<00:05:36.810> as<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.740> get<00:05:37.860> older<00:05:38.190> your

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
people disease as you get older your

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400 
people disease as you get older your
bone<00:05:38.700> density<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:39.540> rolls<00:05:39.840> away<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.290> get

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
bone density it rolls away and get

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.710 
bone density it rolls away and get
osteoporosis<00:05:41.220> but<00:05:41.729> young<00:05:42.150> cystic<00:05:42.690> fibrosis

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
osteoporosis but young cystic fibrosis

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.260 
osteoporosis but young cystic fibrosis
patients<00:05:43.470> can<00:05:43.590> have<00:05:43.620> this<00:05:43.979> as<00:05:44.160> well<00:05:44.400> because

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
patients can have this as well because

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.390 
patients can have this as well because
what's<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.990> very<00:05:46.290> important<00:05:46.770> thing<00:05:46.950> for<00:05:46.979> bone

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
what's a very important thing for bone

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.330 
what's a very important thing for bone
to<00:05:47.520> develop<00:05:47.880> is<00:05:48.000> vitamin<00:05:48.900> D<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.410> think<00:05:49.979> we<00:05:50.220> all

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
to develop is vitamin D I think we all

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.100 
to develop is vitamin D I think we all
notice<00:05:50.640> if<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:50.970> take<00:05:51.180> calcium<00:05:51.660> for<00:05:52.020> your

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
notice if you take calcium for your

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.170 
notice if you take calcium for your
bones<00:05:52.320> most<00:05:53.160> of<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.310> time<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.669> comes<00:05:53.820> with

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
bones most of the time it comes with

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.570 
bones most of the time it comes with
vitamin<00:05:54.690> D<00:05:54.720> now<00:05:55.530> there<00:05:55.710> are<00:05:55.830> four<00:05:56.070> vitamins

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
vitamin D now there are four vitamins

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.810 
vitamin D now there are four vitamins
out<00:05:56.790> of<00:05:56.970> all<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.270> them<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.800> are<00:05:59.100> fat<00:05:59.520> soluble

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
out of all of them that are fat soluble

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.690 
out of all of them that are fat soluble
so<00:06:00.690> if<00:06:00.750> fat<00:06:00.960> soluble<00:06:01.320> means<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.310> vitamin

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
so if fat soluble means that the vitamin

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.880 
so if fat soluble means that the vitamin
has<00:06:02.850> to<00:06:03.060> be<00:06:03.180> absorbed<00:06:03.840> into<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.410> body<00:06:04.500> with

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
has to be absorbed into the body with

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.640 
has to be absorbed into the body with
fat<00:06:05.270> instead<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.419> with<00:06:06.690> water<00:06:06.990> like<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.500> other

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
fat instead of with water like the other

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.710 
fat instead of with water like the other
vitamins<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.430> there<00:06:08.880> are<00:06:08.940> four<00:06:09.240> of<00:06:09.270> them

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
vitamins and there are four of them

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:18.500 
vitamins and there are four of them
so<00:06:10.020> it's<00:06:10.580> vitamins<00:06:11.580> a<00:06:12.050> d<00:06:13.430> e<00:06:14.540> and<00:06:16.220> K<00:06:17.300> notice<00:06:18.300> how

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
so it's vitamins a d e and K notice how

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.510 
so it's vitamins a d e and K notice how
vitamin<00:06:18.900> D<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.140> one<00:06:19.290> of<00:06:19.410> them<00:06:19.560> right<00:06:19.770> so<00:06:20.310> the

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
vitamin D is one of them right so the

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.820 
vitamin D is one of them right so the
impaired<00:06:20.970> fat<00:06:21.630> absorption<00:06:21.930> in<00:06:22.470> people<00:06:22.710> with

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
impaired fat absorption in people with

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.520 
impaired fat absorption in people with
CF<00:06:23.130> makes<00:06:23.970> it<00:06:24.150> hard<00:06:24.390> to<00:06:24.540> get<00:06:24.900> these<00:06:25.169> four

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
CF makes it hard to get these four

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.190 
CF makes it hard to get these four
vitamins<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:27.060> absorb<00:06:27.390> fat<00:06:27.690> in<00:06:27.900> our<00:06:27.990> body

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
vitamins and to absorb fat in our body

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.890 
vitamins and to absorb fat in our body
we<00:06:28.800> need<00:06:29.010> bile<00:06:29.490> from<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.180> liver<00:06:30.330> so<00:06:30.840> I'm

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
we need bile from the liver so I'm

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.600 
we need bile from the liver so I'm
drawing<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.229> liver<00:06:31.500> right<00:06:31.800> here<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:32.250> with<00:06:32.580> a

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
drawing the liver right here and with a

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.730 
drawing the liver right here and with a
clocked<00:06:32.940> chlorine<00:06:33.479> channels<00:06:33.870> and<00:06:34.110> thick

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
clocked chlorine channels and thick

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.430 
clocked chlorine channels and thick
mucus<00:06:35.160> bio<00:06:35.729> actually<00:06:36.240> the<00:06:36.390> bio<00:06:36.539> ducts<00:06:36.930> in<00:06:37.200> that

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
mucus bio actually the bio ducts in that

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.530 
mucus bio actually the bio ducts in that
liver<00:06:37.620> gets

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
liver gets

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.810 
liver gets
so<00:06:38.810> people<00:06:39.080> with<00:06:39.200> CF<00:06:39.470> actually<00:06:39.950> like<00:06:40.160> vile<00:06:40.520> and

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
so people with CF actually like vile and

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.910 
so people with CF actually like vile and
they<00:06:40.940> don't<00:06:41.750> produce<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:42.080> right<00:06:42.500> amount<00:06:42.650> of

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
they don't produce the right amount of

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.220 
they don't produce the right amount of
bile<00:06:43.250> salts<00:06:43.580> so<00:06:43.790> it's<00:06:43.970> hard<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:44.360> absorb<00:06:44.990> these

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
bile salts so it's hard to absorb these

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.950 
bile salts so it's hard to absorb these
vitamins<00:06:46.010> they<00:06:46.700> can<00:06:46.880> eat<00:06:47.060> them<00:06:47.270> but<00:06:47.540> it's<00:06:47.720> hard

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
vitamins they can eat them but it's hard

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.510 
vitamins they can eat them but it's hard
to<00:06:48.050> get<00:06:48.290> into<00:06:48.470> the<00:06:48.560> bloodstream<00:06:48.770> this<00:06:49.250> way<00:06:49.460> so

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
to get into the bloodstream this way so

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.660 
to get into the bloodstream this way so
the<00:06:50.360> lack<00:06:50.600> of<00:06:50.810> vitamin<00:06:51.170> D<00:06:51.380> here<00:06:51.800> leads<00:06:52.370> to

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
the lack of vitamin D here leads to

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.660 
the lack of vitamin D here leads to
osteopenia<00:06:53.800> since<00:06:54.800> we<00:06:54.920> can't<00:06:55.070> change<00:06:55.370> the

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
osteopenia since we can't change the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.330 
osteopenia since we can't change the
fact<00:06:55.880> that<00:06:56.000> this<00:06:56.690> happens<00:06:57.170> there<00:06:58.160> are<00:06:58.250> other

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
fact that this happens there are other

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.430 
fact that this happens there are other
ways<00:06:58.520> to<00:06:58.580> try<00:06:58.970> to<00:06:59.030> maximize<00:06:59.720> the<00:07:00.200> amount<00:07:00.260> of

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
ways to try to maximize the amount of

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.620 
ways to try to maximize the amount of
bone<00:07:00.680> somebody<00:07:01.160> can<00:07:01.280> have<00:07:01.490> and<00:07:02.030> one<00:07:02.270> important

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
bone somebody can have and one important

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.980 
bone somebody can have and one important
way<00:07:02.750> is<00:07:03.020> to<00:07:03.380> exercise<00:07:03.890> especially

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
way is to exercise especially

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.960 
way is to exercise especially
weight-bearing<00:07:05.990> exercises<00:07:06.680> like<00:07:07.010> resistance

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
weight-bearing exercises like resistance

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.240 
weight-bearing exercises like resistance
training<00:07:08.210> of<00:07:09.140> course<00:07:09.410> whatever<00:07:09.590> supplements

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
training of course whatever supplements

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.540 
training of course whatever supplements
we<00:07:10.400> can<00:07:10.640> give<00:07:11.510> them<00:07:11.950> so<00:07:12.950> these<00:07:13.100> are<00:07:13.310> three

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
we can give them so these are three

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.120 
we can give them so these are three
complications<00:07:14.210> that<00:07:14.800> might<00:07:15.800> not<00:07:15.980> be

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.130 
complications that might not be

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.159 
complications that might not be
intuitively<00:07:16.730> associated<00:07:17.360> with<00:07:17.480> CF<00:07:17.720> but<00:07:17.990> I

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169 
intuitively associated with CF but I

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.650 
intuitively associated with CF but I
just<00:07:18.560> want<00:07:18.740> to<00:07:18.860> show<00:07:19.460> you<00:07:19.520> how<00:07:19.910> cystic

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
just want to show you how cystic

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.810 
just want to show you how cystic
fibrosis<00:07:20.690> is<00:07:21.290> so<00:07:21.530> wide-reaching<00:07:22.400> as<00:07:22.730> a

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
fibrosis is so wide-reaching as a

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.630 
fibrosis is so wide-reaching as a
disease<00:07:23.210> it<00:07:23.510> really<00:07:23.960> affects<00:07:24.740> everywhere<00:07:25.550> in

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:25.640 
disease it really affects everywhere in

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.730 
disease it really affects everywhere in
the<00:07:25.730> body<00:07:25.910> so<00:07:26.720> while<00:07:26.960> it<00:07:27.169> should<00:07:27.290> always<00:07:27.470> make

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
the body so while it should always make

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.510 
the body so while it should always make
you<00:07:27.860> think<00:07:28.070> of<00:07:28.300> lung<00:07:29.300> infections<00:07:29.930> and

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
you think of lung infections and

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.920 
you think of lung infections and
nutritional<00:07:31.520> deficiencies<00:07:32.120> don't<00:07:32.690> forget

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 
nutritional deficiencies don't forget

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.210 
nutritional deficiencies don't forget
that<00:07:33.050> there<00:07:33.200> are<00:07:33.230> other<00:07:33.290> complications

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
that there are other complications

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.750 
that there are other complications
associated<00:07:34.820> with<00:07:35.060> CF<00:07:35.419> as<00:07:35.570> well
