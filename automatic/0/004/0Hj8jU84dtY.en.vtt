 with the family that we are very attentive because in this program we are going to 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.820
 go over the steps necessary to convert a boy or girl as 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.070
 you wake up and feel like an expert in furniture manufacturing 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.150
 Attentive to the summary that this family of vocational training has taken is 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.850
 for cicpc you like to do things with your own hands and with the help of a 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.839
 Lots of technologies without being choose belly two formative cycles 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 one of higher grade product development in carpentry and furniture and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.600
 another medium grade fabrication as you install carpentry 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.480
 and furniture 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.910
 blackjack families 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 three hundred occupations you choose 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.500
 and study 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.770
 the formative cycle of medium grade manufacturing installation of 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.020
 carpentry and furniture 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.340
 you will become a professional capable of manufacturing furniture and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.120
 carpentry facilities 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.230
 starting from the base of the most modern manufacturing methods 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.090
 and ending with final installation 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.330
 Throughout two courses you will receive training in graphic expression that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.290
 will allow you to become familiar with the creation of projects 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.790
 and a practical training 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 that will allow you to move from the paper or the senators 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 you will know the technology used 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.320
 the available materials 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.220
 to prevent occupational hazards that I found the sentence 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.360
 the jobs 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.480
 and received a job orientation that began doing internships in the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.980
 companies in the sector 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.060
 do you want to go deeper into the design part 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.660
 for me more than the higher education cycle 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.720
 product development in carpentry and furniture 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.750
 designed furniture and carpentry facilities 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.760
 doing manufacturing projects 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.580
 and installation of carpentry and furniture 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.770
 also performs technical office tasks such as quality controls 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.870
 laboratory tests hehehe 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.540
 take out your artistic vein 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.590
 then you will form in graphic expression applied the carpentry and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.800
 furniture through various computer applications in two 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.639
 puppet dimensions 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.359
 But the thing does not end there 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.469
 to be a good specialist they will complete their training with 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.560
 knowledge in quality processes material purchases 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 orientation and with practices in companies that seek to adapt the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 student to the real work environment and his labor insertion 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.399
 completely 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:31.369
 because it does not give the biggest pointed out that from the first case city 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.219
 from the first day of the city as the founder of the theater 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.459
 from where I can because I want to learn more not being able to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.529
 ok it's doing is no 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:46.889
 because she financial system stores facilitate things 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:54.179
 7 and that women should be more present in this sector I am 100% 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.809
 of status among carpenters percent 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.559
 I would love someone for the alternative where the houses are 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.159
 They are built of wood 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.059
 almost every day with my father 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.999

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.759
 I will work to work, pp. will be aggravated 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.759
 to try this afternoon for the road the highway 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.309
 about the race was loaded 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:16.849
 to make it 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.819
 I hope to count 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.539
 sport 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.889
 by the CGT behind the protests then recognizes how to do as 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.949
 work has been more in processes as professional actor of peru 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.109
 Workplace training 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.840
 it is a mandatory module within the closed door itself 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.180
 which is usually done in the last set the last quarter 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.809
 of the course of the last course of training 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.749
 point of yield 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:51.169
 from the month of April until your union 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.169
 15 faithfully 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.019
 Mandela makes it 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.089
 jobs of companies 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.479
 as they went 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.619
 one more employee of the company 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.129
 where they study 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.139
 the highest degree of product development in carpentry and furniture 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.719
 You can study the children 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.849
 while the average degree of custom fabrication installation 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:13.969
 carpentry and furniture 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.000
 you have it available in japan infiesto and rooms 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.349
 and when it's over 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.419
 and when it's over 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.559
 Well, to work 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.149
 the wood and furniture sector generates more than three thousand 500 jobs in 

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:32.469
 Asturias and keep in mind the entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of the sector are 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.649
 demanding and hiring new qualified personnel that are capable of 

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:38.639
 control the entire manufacturing and installation process 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.389
 And what is more important 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.789
 The business community believes that the activity will continue in the coming years 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.069
 and it is not only strong in asturias 2 that Spain occupies the fourth place 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.569
 in the ranking of European countries producing wood and furniture 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.289
 We are talking about a stable sector 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.849
 which highlights that almost half of the companies are formed by 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.770
 self-employed 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.370
 it's a very good opportunity 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.150
 to become entrepreneurs with entrepreneurs 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.470
 technician in development of carpentry and furniture products has closed 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.730
 machined wood and furniture assembler boards 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.159
 collapsed varnish 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.979
 carpenter today the view 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.979
 what do you want to work 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.090
 five years ago discouragement vocational training we're almost there 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.300
 highlighting the protests later a little bit 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.360
 xinhua 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.550
 in this way that they can leave companions 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.349
 I do not understand very well why your jobs as 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.009
 dressed moments but says goodbye with 13 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.919
 Well, central, a preparation, this same player 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.699
 It's valid because 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.309
 also has 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:56.580
 if you take a euro for positive outside the preparation that these jobs have 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.360
 and once you k- us what they do the idea that they have 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.500
 and not formal that they are and the interest they sometimes have when we catch ourselves 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.210
 we take almost always fixed 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.119
 April 11 already at the time of the accident with a title 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.969
 you have to understand them as a second officer the truth that we are happy 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.119
 that the cavaliere appears 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:23.740
 there it fits perfectly 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.009
 in this way you can also fit perfectly into the decoration 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.599
 of today's labor market in agreement this is a metaphor 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.360
 they worked 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.810
 and functioning as it has to be 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.410
 take advantage of that time and you can design build that install any furniture 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.119
 what can you imagine in agreement 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.100
 this is 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.100
 a consonant rhyme we see you in it follows 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.050
 in the following program efe 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.560
 sure we can do something
