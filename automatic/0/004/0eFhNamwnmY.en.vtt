00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi everyone here super lupine 777 ed 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.150
 here we are in this new wifi fight on 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.750
 pokémon xy then after a short break 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.280
 with the introduction of slow king and tan 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.769
 groot within the team 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 let's go back to the complete team under used 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 with a very old fight there is one of the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 first fights I've done with this team 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 it is tried to guess from here who it will be 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.869
 the worst pokémon of my team 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
 during this fight and we immediately give the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.180
 away to the latter 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.149
 part of the challenge with lily she starts 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.860
 immediately with his ninja tartu that is his 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.710
 plus toys while I start with bacon 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.260
 so very little choice 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.870
 decides to change pokémon while not 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.610
 it just seems to me that you see worse than 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.800
 I don't usually know if only mine 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.640
 impression or is it really so maybe 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.750
 simply display on here 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.190
 preview 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.900
 then maybe when it renders back 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.079
 normal but nevertheless we don't digress 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.199
 decided to immediately change into my gelli 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.600
 one hundred because I knew that mega blas toys 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.760
 generally with black pulsar then black 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.159
 pool save having held up very well o 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.720
 however quite well and it would be 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.689
 activated the black bull policy after that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.729
 with shooting it I could I would 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.810
 could recover life without counting 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.210
 the fact that I could block them black 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.670
 pulsar thanks to fatal body now it 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.009
 know how my friend works here 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.130
 my friend the people decide to escort him 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.229
 to do him then disaster and do a little 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.840
 short jerk while he decides to 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.030
 change pokémon barnes wages the choice 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.009
 according to me it is not very apt because me 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.710
 I could destroy it this is slash and 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.990
 in fact he decides to go immediately for 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.119
 half tested if I'm not wrong exactly 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.819
 not very effective although I am not 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.770
 I still have a physical defender 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.560
 very very well because the defense line 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.749
 it is not indifferent here I go for 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.719
 provocation and here if a cin cin 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:01.780
 seared on the ciccino wasted a egis 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.999
 I leave provoked to the same fate if in 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.069
 the more it is scalded, let's not talk about it 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.749
 if provoked because it does this damage 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.550
 why can't he use real shield then 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.709
 remains in sword form if more is 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.990
 scalded in sword form does little 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.240
 so really damn damage 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.810
 also just to complete the 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.060
 top block square the head 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.390
 thanks body was a fancy and so this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.640
 pokémon will soon greet the field of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.650
 battle goes for stealthy shadow is active 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.110
 my health insurance then makes me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.560
 only favors this eg slush al 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.850
 that I decide to go for a shot 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.050
 take it out a little bit so I lose 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.360
 of life due to sunburn 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.670
 after which the disaster would come and 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.100
 for him it would have been a moment of 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.330
 go ko 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.590
 however, provocation no longer has 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.450
 effect on him never decides to 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.240
 insist with furtive shadow understood that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.160
 he could no longer do anything against it 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.700
 my gelli one hundred I kept on 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.710
 yell at it to shoot and nothing is a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.010
 bit an infamous game but I like doing it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.360
 in short, he loses more damage he has 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.120
 anyway because why am I doing one 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.780
 fight with the team under used yet why 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.550
 I'm designing another team and thinking 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.470
 already have it all clear in my head 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.110
 there are not only pokémon now 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.230
 while I'm talking to you I'm being the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.910
 first of the team pokemon and also 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.120
 two new pokémon I have arrived 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.400
 finished creating today that will come into the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.440
 team under used these not the last part 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.300
 but the last one under used and they will do a little 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.480
 casino in my opinion because if really 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.040
 2 Pokémon I like very much one 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.110
 it had to be shiny that I was looking for 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.910
 for a long time but I have resigned myself 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.730
 because they were more willing to look for him 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.370
 however his hunter ed comes into play 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.050
 obliged estimate unfortunately brings me down 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.840
 because disgrace lore schacht ha 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.140
 brutally and then goes down as well 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.730
 my hierarchy first entered first 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.700
 claire who if I'm not mistaken in the field and there 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.320
 has already left I do not remember well 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.630
 however gelli centers leave the field 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.790
 done his duty in an excellent way 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.290
 I would say this marotta is quite short 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.140
 only 20 shifts 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.540
 but there are very few left of it 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.430
 struggles here on the record data so I have 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.350
 brought what I found to have 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.739
 unfortunately stone cut therefore I fail 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.060
 my poor kamikaze does not say that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.030
 leaves the battlefield but gets caught 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.160
 a lot of damage from this plus toys 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.510
 indeed, among other things , I took less than 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.610
 what I thought I'd go for a 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.130
 another cut stone I still fail 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.190
 and then kamikaze who you deserve to die in 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.950
 this case because you did two 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.420
 failures on two moves you made 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.120
 takes at least some damage from 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.280
 sunburn this is the only good thing e 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.960
 enter into gross gross field that can 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.230
 very well withstand any of his attacks 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.890
 how naturally he is special in 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.440
 kind is also seen with quick pins like 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.240
 it is called arabs around but generally has 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.070
 only special moves here I go 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.200
 I hit the punch to increase the attack 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.360
 that never hurts him he still loses one 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.000
 little bit of life for the burn uses surf 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.100
 surf on mine but csquare as much as the move 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.790
 is printed does not make me practically 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.920
 anything 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.300
 I go for another one that I want to punch 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.120
 increase my attack the most 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.240
 as many as possible now he suffers 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.030
 still sunburn and now if not 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.630
 mistake no joking he withdraws little that 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.920
 I didn't think I went for a 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.930
 furtive shadow however he changes 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.000
 pokémon as in fact I went for 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.120
 fruits shadow goes interhome flame that yes 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.940
 sneak peeks shadow pretty well uses 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.040
 acrobatics on my gross and despite not 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.380
 both a physical defender holds it up 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.780
 in my opinion, he gets a sail 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.880
 stitching and naturally destroys it 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.670
 because a fine and topstitch uncorked more 2 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.140
 from my little but we say that it is not 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.510
 exactly the best thing in the world 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.670
 arrives at Richard makes me files archives and 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.830
 now seeing the life of my little one 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.840
 I decided to have a bad shot, too 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.240
 I decided to go for an explosion and 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.340
 unfortunately an explosion plus two aces a 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.890
 richard really hurts 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.240
 so bye bye there is richard perfect 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.550
 so he also looks for some 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.470
 Battle together with Gross in this 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.250
 struggle is particular because there have been 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.500
 two deaths simultaneously in the sense is 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.600
 dead that is a garden is gone ko be the 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.400
 mine with its pokémon twice in the 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.050
 same instant if you noticed one for 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.060
 destiny forced one by explosion 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.210
 however this bacon point can 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.340
 of course to host this one 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.050
 blas toys even decides to mega 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.700
 evolve so right to have some 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.680
 extra special defense in the case not 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.840
 had managed to send him ko what 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.020
 absurd because he was dead by now 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.720
 however, you never know too much 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.740
 I send kappa and only his own remains 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.330
 managed to be thrown down 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.099
 escape that tries to make me the most the most 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.479
 possible damage with a furtive shadow 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:58.669
 but it doesn't do me much as it isn't much 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.410
 effective and is also burned to this 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.590
 black point pool will be in sword form 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:07.160
 question easily ko and this was the 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.349
 fight was the fight and let's see wait 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.270
 that ends up perfect and defeated lily the 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:14.060
 my worst pokémon as you could 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.280
 well see was I duct the why it is 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.050
 his state was really absurd 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.530
 performance was really disgusting 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.729
 this time it will not matter if this fight 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.710
 liked it I invite you as always to 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.340
 leave a nice one I hope to 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.470
 being able to make the new team that will be 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.360
 a rain team 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.430
 in a short time that's why the first one 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.539
 pokémon has now finished pouring it 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:40.099
 meanwhile, I hope nothing 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:41.930
 in a short time, however, there are 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.940
 the other two ready pokémon enter 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.080
 in the under hughes team and try to do 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.599
 some nice fight 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.220
 if this this video is liked how 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.990
 where I invite you to leave a nice one I like 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.110
 see you at the next hello video 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.110
 Hello
