00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
for everybody else but you know I guess

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.220 
for everybody else but you know I guess
cuz<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.230> see<00:03:41.530> other<00:03:41.830> young<00:03:42.160> girls<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:44.110> know

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
cuz I see other young girls in you know

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.050 
cuz I see other young girls in you know
they<00:03:44.440> were<00:03:44.500> there<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.980> natural<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.640> anything

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
they were there a natural and anything

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.120 
they were there a natural and anything
like<00:03:46.269> takes<00:03:46.720> forever<00:03:46.989> for<00:03:47.500> them<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.739> get<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.099> a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
like takes forever for them to get to a

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.190 
like takes forever for them to get to a
certain<00:03:48.370> minute<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:49.060> guess<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.630> all<00:03:49.720> depends
