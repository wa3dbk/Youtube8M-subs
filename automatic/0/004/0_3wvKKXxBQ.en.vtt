experience of a hybrid road car

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
experience of a hybrid road car
initially<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> cars<00:01:01.410> silent<00:01:02.100> pulling<00:01:02.820> away

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
initially the cars silent pulling away

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
initially the cars silent pulling away
you<00:01:03.120> hear<00:01:03.449> nothing<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.170> until<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:04.979> put<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you hear nothing at all until we put the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.950 
you hear nothing at all until we put the
throttle<00:01:05.400> down<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
throttle down a little bit more and then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.480 
throttle down a little bit more and then
the<00:01:07.049> combustion<00:01:07.380> engine<00:01:07.799> starts<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> kick<00:01:08.460> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the combustion engine starts to kick in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
the combustion engine starts to kick in
and<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.360> exactly<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> same<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and and that's exactly the same in the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.260 
and and that's exactly the same in the
racing<00:01:10.830> car<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.790> down<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> pit

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
racing car as well we go down the pit

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
racing car as well we go down the pit
lane<00:01:12.299> dead<00:01:13.170> silent<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.340> release<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
lane dead silent and then we release the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.620 
lane dead silent and then we release the
clutch<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.729> burst<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
clutch and that actually burst the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.820 
clutch and that actually burst the
combustion<00:01:18.960> engine<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.619> life

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.820 

I'm<00:01:23.630> driving<00:01:24.630> along<00:01:24.870> at<00:01:24.990> normal<00:01:25.320> Road<00:01:25.500> speeds

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I'm driving along at normal Road speeds

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.650 
I'm driving along at normal Road speeds
and<00:01:26.160> just<00:01:26.310> listen<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> common<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
and just listen it's so common here and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.510 
and just listen it's so common here and
it<00:01:30.990> helps<00:01:31.260> create<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.620> really<00:01:32.040> relaxing

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it helps create a really relaxing

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.180 
it helps create a really relaxing
driving<00:01:32.910> experience<00:01:34.190> automatic

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
driving experience automatic

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.190 
driving experience automatic
transmission<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:36.240> adds<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> stress<00:01:36.990> free

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
transmission also adds the stress free

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
transmission also adds the stress free
driving<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.550> need<00:01:38.790> after

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
driving and it's just what I need after

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
driving and it's just what I need after
the<00:01:39.300> noise<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> racer<00:01:40.080> can<00:01:40.440> tell<00:01:40.620> you<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the noise of racer can tell you the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.130 
the noise of racer can tell you the
interesting<00:01:45.120> thing<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> use<00:01:45.750> hybrid

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
interesting thing is you can use hybrid

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.930 
interesting thing is you can use hybrid
technology<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.040> two<00:01:47.220> different<00:01:47.430> ways<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
technology in two different ways it

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.820 
technology in two different ways it
seems<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.720> race<00:01:48.900> car<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.710> about

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
seems in the race car it's more about

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.340 
seems in the race car it's more about
performance<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.850> they're<00:01:51.510> using<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> hybrid

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
performance and they're using the hybrid

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.350 
performance and they're using the hybrid
engine<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.400> give<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.790> an<00:01:54.030> extra

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
engine to actually give you an extra

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.830 
engine to actually give you an extra
boost<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.840> power<00:01:55.050> rather<00:01:55.500> than<00:01:55.650> saving<00:01:56.310> fuel

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
boost of power rather than saving fuel

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.100 
boost of power rather than saving fuel
in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.680> road<00:01:58.830> car<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.640> all<00:01:59.820> about

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
in the road car it's all about

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.680 
in the road car it's all about
conserving<00:02:01.110> fuel<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.979> quiet<00:02:02.940> city<00:02:03.270> driving

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
conserving fuel and quiet city driving

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.890 
conserving fuel and quiet city driving
and<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:05.460> car<00:02:05.700> sets<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.150> new<00:02:06.330> benchmark<00:02:06.479> for

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
and this car sets a new benchmark for

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.680 
and this car sets a new benchmark for
city<00:02:07.229> cars<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.280> Yaris<00:02:08.580> produces<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.300> 79

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.970 
with no road tax and great resale values
and<00:02:15.810> you've<00:02:15.900> got<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> car<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.800> makes

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and you've got a car that really makes

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.449 
and you've got a car that really makes
great<00:02:17.340> financial<00:02:17.760> sense<00:02:18.770> i'm<00:02:19.770> also<00:02:20.160> really
