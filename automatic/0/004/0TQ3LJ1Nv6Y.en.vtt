really<00:01:38.600> practiced<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.780> zerg<00:01:40.650> vs<00:01:40.890> protoss

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
really practiced much zerg vs protoss

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
really practiced much zerg vs protoss
and<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.060> tended<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.750> my<00:01:42.899> weakest<00:01:43.619> match

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and that tended to be my weakest match

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.170 
and that tended to be my weakest match
up<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> matchup<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.700> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> holding

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
up the matchup that was kind of holding

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.170 
up the matchup that was kind of holding
me<00:01:45.450> back<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> made<00:01:46.890> some<00:01:47.070> adjustments<00:01:47.189> there

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
me back so I made some adjustments there

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.870 
me back so I made some adjustments there
and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.600> also<00:01:49.460> practicing<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and then also practicing a lot of the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.280 
and then also practicing a lot of the
newer<00:01:51.060> maps<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.570> being<00:01:51.750> used<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
newer maps that are being used in these

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.940 
newer maps that are being used in these
map<00:01:52.530> pools<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.720> basically<00:01:55.110> analyzing

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
map pools and just basically analyzing

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.889 
map pools and just basically analyzing
my<00:01:56.040> plan<00:01:56.280> spending<00:01:56.759> more<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.939> my<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.600> my

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
my plan spending more of my time on my

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560 
my plan spending more of my time on my
weaknesses<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.829> adjusting<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.670> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
weaknesses and adjusting to that is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.700 
weaknesses and adjusting to that is

mechanics there he's going to be an

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.070 
mechanics there he's going to be an
extremely<00:02:49.610> dangerous<00:02:49.910> point<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.600> play<00:02:50.780> but

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
extremely dangerous point to play but

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.979 
extremely dangerous point to play but
you<00:02:51.709> know<00:02:51.830> hopefully<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:53.390> play<00:02:53.720> well
