00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.239
 are one and a half pound of breast of 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.750
 boneless chicken half cup of bread crumb 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.150
 an egg can replace the egg by 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.059
 melted butter or by half a cup 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.710
 of milk and finally salt and pepper 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.710
 ground cumin to taste 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.910
 good to start I'll put in a 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.250
 bowl the egg white too 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.650
 If you prefer, you can use the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.360
 whole egg and beat it but in this 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.460
 I 'm just going to use it 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.950
 only the clear 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.250
 in another container I will put the average 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.350
 cup of bread crushed and also apart I'll 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.290
 to make a mixture with pepper salt and 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.150
 ground cumin to taste 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 good to start I'll start to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.200
 season each of the breasts with the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.290
 mixture that I made with pepper salt and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.290
 cumin 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.770
 good since I have all the breasts 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.660
 sanctioned chicken then I will pass 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.520
 each of them first I'm going to 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.070
 soak through the egg by the clear 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.460
 egg and then I'm going to pass them through 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.710
 the ground bread to bread the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.900
 and so we are going to do with each of the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.450
 chicken breasts now if you guys 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.810
 They decided to replace the egg by 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.270
 be the melted butter or by the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.190
 milk then they will first soak the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.290
 breast in milk or butter 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.500
 and then they're going to go through the bread 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.630
 ground to bread 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.300
 we are not going to put each one of the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 Breasts breaded on a plate and already 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.290
 that we have them all ready 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.330
 then we will cover them with plastic 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.070
 and we're going to refrigerate them in the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.410
 refrigerator until such time as the 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.360
 let's go to cook to cook the chicken 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.400
 I'm going to put a pan on the stove with 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.650
 the medium-high flame and then I'll 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
 add a little oil once the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.640
 oil is hot I will fry the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.730
 chicken breasts and I'll leave them 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.030
 Fry between 3 to 4 minutes per each 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.030
 side 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.890
 good when the chicken is ready 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.960
 then we are going to put them on 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.210
 napkins to absorb the excess 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.740
 of fat once you have done this 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.960
 then we can start serving his 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.120
 You can accompany it with rice 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.460
