Hi, these are DIARIES OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS. And today, on August 5th, another 6 medal events will be held.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:36.680
Lets start with some good news, as a couple of hours ago, Artem Silchenko from Russia, won his bronze medal in high diving. Well, Alex Pshenichny will tell you more about it. I will tell you about swimming today. Lets go!

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:57.540
It was not easy to be a Russian team fan this evening. But lets take it step by step. Men semi-final 100 meters freestyle. 2 russian swimmers. Wonderful swimming style. Morozov is first. Suhorukov is 4th.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:10.940
And here the stadium started blasting off. an unknown abbreviation appeared next to the name of our champion – DSQ, which meant our swimmer was disqualified because of false start.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:22.840
And that was his best race, and he was expected to be the main competitor for the gold. Yes, it was not easy to be a Russian team fan this evening.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:38.640
Well, guys, I am still shocked by Morozov’s being disqualified, and that’s a bad luck for our national team. As I am watching at the final list of women semi final, where Anastasiya Zueva took only 9th place and didn’t qualify for the final as a result.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:51.920
And a few minutes ago, a final in 200 meters freestyle among women just finished and Veronika Popova brought us the wooden medal for her 4th place. No good news for today, at all.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.920
On the other hand, some fans today really had their luck today.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:13.320
Katie Ledecky from USA has won her 3rd medal in 200 meters freestyle. Chinese swimmer Sun Yang and british Adam Peaty won their 2nd golden medals as well.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.780
A swimmer from Hungary, Laszlo Cseh, won gold in 200 meters butterfly.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:32.440
Our main expectations however were connected with mixed relay, where we qualified to from 4th place. But bad luck means really bad luck.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:52.980
After the first lap our Nastya Pesikova was half a pool behind 7 male opponents. Yulia Efimova made a gap reach almost a pool, and finally 5th position thanks to Vladimir Morozov’s lap.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.420
The british have won the race and set the new world record, thus reducing the gap between UK and USA in medal standings.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:14.220
If you think that’s enough of bad news for today, you are wrong. Our female water polo team has also lost its match today to Greece in a game for 5-8 places.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:31.660
Ok, now we can say that this was all the bad news for the day. We hope tomorrow our athletes will give us more joyful moments. These were DIARIES OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS. Behave sporty.
