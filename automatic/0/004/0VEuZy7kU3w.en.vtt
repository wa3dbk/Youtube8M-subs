00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
gonna do the impossible we're gonna mix

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.570 
gonna do the impossible we're gonna mix
water<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.059> gas<00:00:09.300> not<00:00:10.019> hydrogen<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:11.010> hydro

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
water and gas not hydrogen not hydro

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.280 
water and gas not hydrogen not hydro
boost<00:00:11.730> not<00:00:12.030> any<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.540> stuff<00:00:12.690> we're<00:00:13.139> gonna

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
boost not any of that stuff we're gonna

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.000 
boost not any of that stuff we're gonna
mix<00:00:13.559> water<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.400> gas<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.170> can<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.650> we're

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
mix water and gas in a can and we're

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.880 
mix water and gas in a can and we're
gonna<00:00:17.130> pour<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> car<00:00:17.850> right<00:00:18.449> guys

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.259 

they're<00:00:22.890> gonna<00:00:22.980> change<00:00:23.340> their<00:00:23.609> tune<00:00:23.820> real

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
they're gonna change their tune real

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.990 
they're gonna change their tune real
soon<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.410> let<00:00:26.279> me<00:00:26.369> show<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.880> we're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
gonna do here is gonna get the gas go

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.500 
gonna do here is gonna get the gas go
get<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> gas<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> water<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.510> we'll

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
get the gas you get the water and we'll

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.840 
get the gas you get the water and we'll
be<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.780> back<00:00:34.370> welcome<00:00:35.370> back<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> hard

all right there we go now here's the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.960 
all right there we go now here's the
problem<00:01:53.940> kids<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.470> too<00:01:55.650> much<00:01:55.770> water<00:01:55.970> we

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
problem kids we use too much water we

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.540 
problem kids we use too much water we
were<00:01:57.060> only<00:01:57.210> supposed<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:57.630> 10%<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.860> use<00:01:59.010> 16

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
were only supposed to use 10% we use 16

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.180 
were only supposed to use 10% we use 16
ounces<00:01:59.910> which<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.930> means<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.560> 15%

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
ounces which actually means we have 15%

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.570 
ounces which actually means we have 15%
water<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:03.930> we're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.010> ballsy

there<00:04:31.780> but<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> very<00:04:32.290> small<00:04:32.680> amount<00:04:32.830> now<00:04:33.490> as<00:04:33.610> we

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
there but a very small amount now as we

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.510 
there but a very small amount now as we
all<00:04:33.790> know<00:04:34.150> water<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.200> heavier<00:04:35.710> than<00:04:35.860> gas<00:04:36.070> so

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
all know water is heavier than gas so

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.950 
all know water is heavier than gas so
what's<00:04:36.700> gonna<00:04:36.820> happen<00:04:36.910> if<00:04:37.360> we<00:04:37.480> put<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.690> water

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
gas mixture into this tank it's gonna go

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.260 
gas mixture into this tank it's gonna go
to<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.630> bottom<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.380> pickup<00:04:41.890> so<00:04:42.730> even<00:04:43.180> if
