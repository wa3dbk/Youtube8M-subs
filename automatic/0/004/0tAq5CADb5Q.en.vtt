00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.380
 all guys I was born this video in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.570
 this video 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 I will make an attack a little special than not 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 I never did and I don't think I'll do it in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.949
 followed but still wanted to try it 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.949
 because I've never seen her in action 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.230
 so I decided to make an attack 25 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.539
 valkyries I find that they are units 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.540
 very strong but not having we 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.340
 used to be on the safe side and therefore 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.690
 attached a simple base 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.829
 municipal so just easy easy 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 but just to not lose it I am a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.989
 good is the only disadvantage they occupy 8 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 to the nine hundred of life and 88 they give him however 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.559
 occupy 8 and in my opinion is the only thing 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.949
 that makes them useless or almost 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.989
 the fact that they attack whatever that is 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 any building not just defenses 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 like accidents the defenses attacked 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.229
 they would be great at the beginning by sending them 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.200
 one to make you understand how much life there 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.509
 look to kill her they want some 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 shots and then I send them a little 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 17 sites generally all together for 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.040
 make you understand their destructive force 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.670
 as you can see and with a turn 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.250
 they destroy everything look good not 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.460
 added appropriately to over parks and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 I decided to bring me 12 spells 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 care and fury a cure spell 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 use or else the rest do not use e 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.450
 I did not use the barbarian king but it seems to me 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.270
 however if I used it it was gone 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.189
 no don't use it as you can see they do 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.399
 give to give to what means when 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:56.630
 Julian take the walls or groups of you 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:00.140
 three neighboring buildings and so and so on and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.640
 they hit everything like I said they would 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.000
 strong if it were not for the fact that 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.130
 they attack all the buildings and therefore yes 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.619
 they make you lose the peck at this 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.989
 problem but let alone the games 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.269
 we say this as you can see how it is 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:19.090
 100 percent easy it will be 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:22.250
 dead you're the maximum if not less e 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.170
 now only two cannons remain 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.110
 however, I would say first that I decided to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.459
 make a video about a day but 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.709
 this time the audience is more 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.250
 possible to recover old ones 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.720
 and bye bye to all the guys I hope the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.970
 video you liked voted and commented 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.069

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.069
 video you like I liked it to me
