00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello in spite of the fact that creating 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.870
 the so-called lunar manicure 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 the process of the last complex it causes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.970
 There are a lot of questions about this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.890
 today i will try to show on my 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 a look is the easiest version of this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
 design to replenish this design 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.260
 gel polishes we need 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.090
 base topcoat for gel polishes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 also two in contrasting colors either one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.610
 Contrast color for drawing lines 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.480
 the smiles you need are like this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 thin 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.910
 artwork tassels 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.789
 for example from a marker of varnish and grip 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 either kr2 take small with thin 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 tail can use a brush 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 a bit thicker like acer 3 here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 such a case 3 honestly I'm not very 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 convenient to work if you can see it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.729
 is a longer hair and I 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.510
 I use such brushes for drawing 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.630
 more 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 some long longitudinal lines 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.119
 this brush and n l number six but if 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.130
 she is in your arsenal of course 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.650
 to try 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.520
 to fix the lune you need 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.590
 Here is such a gel brush before applying 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.710
 gel polish must be disinfected 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.560
 special nail plate 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 disinfector om for nails and collections 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.090
 gordon there are two types of base coverage 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.460
 one on the vitamin base and base and top 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.820
 coating in one flakonchik since u 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.200
 me my model today slightly 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.649
 weakened on to the point we will still 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.950
 use a vitamin base but a for 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.170
 top cover is already using a hybrid 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.979
 bases and stamps 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.049
 our base coat is a thin layer 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.070
 neatly cuticle literally short 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.320
 half a mile 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.780
 nitro at the side rollers carefully all 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.250
 paint over and be sure to seal 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.910
 end after polymerization in led-lamp 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.010
 base coverage for 30 seconds i 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.640
 I put on the whole leg 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.660
 base color layer for this i 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.240
 I use color number 24 today 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.840
 dazzling french overlapping spring to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:43.040
 dots since the color was one layer he did not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.330
 we lay down tight after polymerization 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.050
 we will put one more layer after drawing 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.209
 two or three layers of primary color 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.670
 color coverage we need to choose 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.530
 as I said at the beginning of the contrast 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.590
 the color I chose number 63 is a berry from 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.720
 ingarden collection 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.150
 I put a small drop of gel polish on 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.970
 palette and using thin 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:21.620
 synthetic brush dial small 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.750
 the amount of gel polish on the brush tip and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.570
 in order for the lune to happen 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.750
 exactly and for myself I first put such 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.840
 marks visually determine the middle 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.070
 nail cuticle I retreat well about 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.780
 somewhere 6 7 millimeters 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:47.070
 put a dot then from the cuticle on top i 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.569
 backing off about somewhere as well 6 7 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.409
 millimeters 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.799
 God put a mark already on the edge 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:04:00.599
 cuticle and on the back of the cuticle 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:06.239
 From the corner I put symmetrically the points with 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:08.219
 other side in order to determine 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.280
 exactly do you put these points 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.810
 such tags peculiar flip 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.859
 finger yourself 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.530
 yourself to the other side and look 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:28.020
 from this side sometimes it happens 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:30.840
 much poorer again drop the brush in 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.070
 gel polish and gently draw 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.900
 line first 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.900
 thin at the cuticle 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.639
 further we have identified with you the top 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.569
 the border will now be denoted by the lower 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.289
 the border 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:09.919
 our needles are connecting the side point 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:13.280
 the middle and the middle with the opposite 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:18.699
 side point now remains for us 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.699
 just paint over the milk in the middle 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:28.639
 often the color is not very dense 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.449
 so you can apply two coats after 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:35.330
 polymerization using synthetic 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.870
 gel brushes you can gently 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.389
 touch up the moon yes if it is you 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.520
 somewhere went over the borders by this brush 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:06:01.909
 the main thing to remember is that she should 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:06:04.490
 be dry and clean at the end don't forget 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.310
 put necessarily top top 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.569
 coating after polymerization remove 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.419
 flexibility and apply a mass like this to my 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.529
 look for a while 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.849
 practicing can be very easy 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.839
 create this design option 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.659
 experiment try 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.060
 some kind of contrasting 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.439
 colors 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.779
 I hope you take advantage of our 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:32.509
 advice all questions you have 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.159
 please leave under the video all 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.400
 Thank you very much for your attention and to the new ones 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.400
 meeting
