00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.290
 onboard computer multitronics 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:22.090
 expiration why exactly 150 and they from 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.090
 mouth fatal because you need votes 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.150
 box 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.150
 multitronic 10 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.300
 came the corporate package 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.300
 also the use of the type 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:14.750
 very original such kids can 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.750
 use 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.660
 as intended 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:49.720
 installation read a favor 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.200
 complex like to set should not 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:02.649
 establish a regular place 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:02.649
 remove the plugs from us 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.640
 launch can be a video shoot on 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.640
 phone 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.790
 what is it we have it we guarantee 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:36.840
 coupon 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:38.540
 we think not useful onboard 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:51.360
 computer 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:59.940
 Here is such a recipe for temperature 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:05.090
 the sensor still wires are not so necessary they 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.330
 we will not be useful here is to wire line 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:14.700
 connects CBD connector 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:24.470
 I will show this to the guide later. 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:24.470
 operation is very thick book 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.340
 try to install 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:42.430
 here we have a connector 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:46.409
 you need to insert it here 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.409
 who came from the onboard computer 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:04.230
 very convenient to do all this of course with 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:04.230
 phone so but I will explain later on pause 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:13.859
 loose nest inserted so now 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:20.919
 put 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:24.340
 inserted this wire further and u can 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.000
 will hold neatly but so for my sake 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.500
 the experiment is connected directly 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.500
 immediately into the diagnostic socket 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.930
 find here you are a line but that's 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.810
 read the loss how to find it 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:22.120
 I will not tell well and record 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:24.360
 accordingly, it is hard to put in here 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.380
 and now 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.780
 accordingly connect the chip from 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.950
 onboard computer with a chip with this 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:44.330
 flash like a pause 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:50.690
 what did you connect seems to work like 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:06:03.140
 would need to tune up this very 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:06:12.140
 how long the setup process is all 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:15.320
 Yes of course it's cleaned hides sensor 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.140
 temperature sensor 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.050
 incipio all usually leaves it in 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:25.700
 cabin to show cabin temperature 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.820
 they are outdoor temperature and on the panel 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.830
 appliances already have a temperature sensor in 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.570
 principle stone can their principle not 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.050
 connect but at will it is natural 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.050
 hiding 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.210
 let's say wherever it works 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.560
 I did not have time to shoot here I turned on the ignition 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:19.030
 protocol 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:21.300
 brains in general, you can enter settings 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.300
 manually 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.520
 of course everything needs to be customized 

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.650
 let's attention
