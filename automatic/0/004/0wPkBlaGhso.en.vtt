00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.450
 but on 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.720
 horse owner 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.400
 parkpop ask wernbloom 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.969
 rosemary 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.990
 in saly 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 if you get his share it gets you in and then you have a painful but one 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.310
 small piece of land needed then you can already have many different herbs or 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 And sometimes piggy bank comes one day there is also an option 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 I actually start to look at the herb garden there with a drawing or want there 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.680
 I what 6 3 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.750
 I am therefore starting to participate in laying out the layout globally with some suits so that 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.840
 I better know where I want to put something 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.890
 in the first thing i do is make a pile of walls for the herbs that of the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.140
 keep warm 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.960
 but the pile wall at is very good of those universities with the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.590
 different and insects can have their hiding place there 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.380
 but also the warmth of the sun that is held in a stone and 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.430
 before that I will put the lavender and the rosemary and thyme 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.620
 Some drive and then to Venlo are a plot of land in the first 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.440
 and the second half of this week in municipality extra instruments and stones 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.580
 or resent 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.790
 and with others and plants that we can actually grow on which soil 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.049
 sit here and austria 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.110
 every day and night 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.340
 when you start you also have to think about which herbs you want 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.619
 probably insanely tasty and can use them 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.980
 And then it's good to remember that you have 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.470
 while a drawing is made, there must be Belgians French 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.659
 which herbs are behind me there are the high herbs 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.549
 where does the sun come days when you get there naturally i get that movie in which they 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.480
 need 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.880
 and where is some damage, the number of months full of parsley bets 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 of green 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.139
 you can possibly even meet you 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:20.379
 Herbal plants can be purchased everywhere in the market but also in stores 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.369
 but also take a look around the gardens of your friends land that expanded 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.369
 getting out of the star quickly is very easy to get into pieces 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.349
 that is also a stadium of my own I want to sail by but rejuvenate 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.430
 rosalie is completely wooden box english so a ticket salih partially it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.580
 digging in sixteen becomes the writer and a young plant 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.049
 cleared 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
 That is actually it is the first phase of the herbs 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.610
 one day we will continue 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.269
 we are going with the two-year plan for an oncoming car 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.189
 and I have to plant it for another year and then want to move 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.939
 so ask the route
