00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.319
 good hello youtube friends here you 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.300
 I want 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.640
 carlos cr x 85 crx srx good then 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.539
 Today I'm going to show you how to download 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.060
 the zombie straight mode control for the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.270
 control strike can be in 1.6 austin and 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.100
 also then in the good end the first 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.770
 What we should do is give our 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.260
 browser 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.370
 match the link I'll leave it in the in the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.329
 video description 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.399
 as always by mediafire 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 and always almost in the file they always go 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.370
 to do by half fire everything depends on 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.370
 what is going up 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.930
 why 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.699
 we are going to paste the following link that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.170
 nvidia faes as he had said 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.170
 before they repeat a lot of fire 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.079
 and computer in which it takes a lot 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.670
 well here I already entered the end is that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.740
 have a slower computer than 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 turtle without legs 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:18.119
 good what says carlos cr x 85 points 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:22.070
 exit good weighs 225 points 7 mb 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.070
 we put you in doubt 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.659
 but good if they have the crown they will 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.939
 appear this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.909
 well I canceled it because obviously 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.330
 I have it so following what they 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.150
 comes is this 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.110
 the straight zombie contract is this 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.200
 good installation file this one already 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.439
 find strike 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.360
 1.6 good if the votes you want if you already 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.040
 they have extra control, nothing else 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.870
 it would be a matter of opening it 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 we open it 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.649
 [Music] 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.649
 we put it to execute 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.630
 and the typical installation will appear 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.039
 but good thing is that for that you already have to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.039
 have installed and against strike 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.730
 good here is and zombie chaos is installed 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:31.230
 addons version 2.0 is not in Spanish and 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.230
 this is why we can not move forward 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.150
 and install a terminal you're not going to 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:39.700
 be able to install where 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.299
 it's very important because they put that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 box move forward again and here we can 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.110
 to procure 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.690
 well yes we have it on my pc if not 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.320
 we have the draft in my pc we put 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.520
 local disk program files and 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.520
 here they have to appear 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.340
 counter strike 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.450
 I think I no longer have here it here 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.540
 already 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.540
 I do not have who does not tell you this 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.040
 Y 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.080
 Carlos the club and Carlos to remove it 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.620
 I have to find strikes we put them 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.270
 found I bring 1.6 and what we put 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.080
 in the folder where it says 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.360
 like so this album should be 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.989
 local and good the folder that I have it 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.790
 installed counter strike against the king 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:56.599
 1.66 s creek 23 advance and now 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.410
 paint the files as I have it 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.220
 good 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.220
 good as I have it 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.530
 I 'm going to teach you this bad 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.530
 the glass machine and ready 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.040
 so well I'll put it 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.690
 and it was a great little mix and good to 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.060
 a full home I'm not going to do this 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.600
 and a sample of how the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.600
 counter 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.090
 with him is that here now 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.650
 here 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.639
 good 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.639
 you here that style 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.600
 [Music] 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.009
 good here is already 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:56.539
 ok we can do things with german 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.569
 if we can we can put that is not so 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.599
 so so 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.009
 so dark well let's say carefully in 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.330
 the percent 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.330
 and it depends on the chancellery 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.770
 I think it's the way my plan is 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.210
 good clear aissami 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.210
 if not I know where 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.850
 a there is no good multiple infection here 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.850
 it's changing, I'm not good 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.139
 and this guy not to me served me 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.300
 Chick 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:43.599
 the good model this 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.380
 and then we just have to play it 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.310
 DÃ­az stated that this 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.740
 and that would be all 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.650
 and then good until the next friends do not
