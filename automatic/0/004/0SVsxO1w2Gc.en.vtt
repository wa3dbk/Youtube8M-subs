 nuclear power plant to receive two new generators from the court 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 which will contribute to the increase of its useful life by at least 20 years is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 much more energy for Brazil 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.509
 the new Doppler generators were manufactured in a partnership between the company

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.000
 the exit of the shed from the nucletron to the port is accompanied by

 close by many workers who participated in the construction of the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.440
 equipment 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.700
 although the distance of less than 100 kilometers will be necessary 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
 several days to complete this transport operation 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.270
 but the trip will only begin in fact the next day 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.689
 people are just beginning to get up when the first generator starts 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.809
 to the maritime terminal of the bicycle 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.739
 it takes more than two hours to cover a route of less than

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.079
 this movement in front of which it enters and leaves is under the equipment 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.729

 and is capable of carrying up to one thousand tons of cargo 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.669
 the shipment operation is performed very accurately 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.139
 respecting the conditions of the time and the navy 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.859

 another day when the base comes back to Itabaiana to seek the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.249
 second generator 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.860
 the replacement of generators to give by planned for the next months 

00:04:56.859 --> 00:05:01.139
 means the actual possibility of extending the service life of angra 1 and 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.699
 another 20 years 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.419
 This will certainly be the largest
