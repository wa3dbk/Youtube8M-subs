00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:03.689
 yes welcome to the region 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.410
 but this step I'm here to answer 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 to your fundamental question how to settle it is a contempt history of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.100
 first reclaimed dead to make their work work for that they have 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.779
 first started by making it tour 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.779
 we will show you this but now 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.279
 it has no scale generated during how cost of this generic 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.729
 like a hot shot of structure 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.920
 this brings 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.490
 when we have nothing that cÃ©dric 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.640
 beyond the anecdote explain how to approach the cavaliere that's what you 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 Come and dance the rest the same at each step me it made me think 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.910
 as in every calendar year 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.440
 for the times the best way to fight that had seized well was to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.510
 having him push him to the cavern on time next to the dance floor on 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.630
 the edge burgundy arms standing and he has only one desire 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.630
 it's a rider coming to look for it and the phrase launched 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.200
 you approach home rather severe 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.980
 and you gently ask him just these seeds with you 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.120
 most often for the program he will be ready to carry their lead 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560
 the machete 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.049
 what's that and if his daughter 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.680
 She is dead 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.450
 if she answers no it can happen and it is surely not if he is tired or 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.450
 so because to dance a dance before all this 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.810
 just see the cavalier notes is not always enough to dance 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 there are more riders and riders understand 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.780
 who touched this former rider 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.620
 beside 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.550
 just waiting for the guests 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.160
 portrait of a real one we came across on the dance floor 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.820
 after adjustment do not disturb the six years provides the reform do not know 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.430
 at all that not just looking for people who are just waiting 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.159
 for the unions 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.590
 and let them dance 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.280
 quite simply 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219
 obviously who naturally have no 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.890
 everywhere around you 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.490
 of each dance floor the girls stands 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.349
 it's like waiting for people like you to invite them to dance 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.189
 the beginners' reception we will learn how to dance 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.969
 with me you will take easy courses through which you will become 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.030
 comfortable on the dance floor that does not matter this current level by learning alone 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.299
 in front of your computer 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.299
 at the end of these beginner courses he would be able to get out 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
 you will learn quickly to enjoy the children 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.949
 to let go 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.909
 for many runners I noticed that hundreds of students in the 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.480
 apple stores could do 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 afterwards we can say that michael phelps has 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.209
 there is something that is good 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.299
 he ended up not comfortable in English it's not difficult to do well this 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.819
 movement so i'm going to show you the command well performed the rider 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:48.730
 in a park 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.479
 the opposite of my career 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.269
 we will turn the fingers inside the yard me the rider 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 we need to go over his head 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.549
 the tormented career 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.639
 gently to show you but you have to 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.529
 Explained the fact that fingers his accomplice in the palm of the rider 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.619
 when I hear people dancing unfortunately for them 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.939
 class it seems to me a simple statement you have to make a confidence 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:26.439
 - proment bank the bank judge that his movement would become much more 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.879
 How is it possible 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.739
 but this is the theme of the movement you are showing the base of 6-2 movements 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.169
 the less good trivial things in this attack that did not do honor 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.059
 but you can still not trained 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.319
 and make the move 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.730
 alone when I want revenge is not tenable I do not 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.300
 represent that they themselves then rainer arnold klein takes two fingers 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.830
 db i'm running the last victim this sport 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.520
 the palm of welcome has fallen back around a myth of the superhero I 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.430
 know how to turn the head this attention a move all things that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.760
 go out of the box ok it's not a pizza why nobody goes there with the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.810
 back of the hand no it's something really quietly placed 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.819
 led by good addresses for the actor 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.569
 the customs turning in the turmoil of the war and after we can like that 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.429
 awesome just like with the two fingers of the home service of google france 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.800
 once upon a time a moving world all the dancers knew how to do well 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 turn the busy 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.520
 I do not believe it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.840
 he will always 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.270
 dancers who will not arrive 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.919
 to turn their hearts and their pursuers laurent boyer the first to 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.919
 every time if we are Catholic and who thinks we are well 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.259
 otherwise it's a girl who was 10 years old in this case the rn12 obviously she has 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.650
 well done and you will not have much to do 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.020
 but it comes back 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.500
 as for all other cases it is better not to take this Tuesday at the end of 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.639
 day gr 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.360
 encounter with the right hand we would tend 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.219
 enough hand 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.629
 like these 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:04.750
 those who make spot 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.729
 after the end of turn of power instructions 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.830
 completely stuck 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.150
 because we have no smoke was in the water 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.720
 the only debate like all models in an order that do not put in 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.160
 cause their way of dancing here imagine that because they already have 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.490
 does the movement 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.080
 they know how to do it perfectly 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.260
 so we can everything 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.520
 days improve a movement even though it is very simple 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.559
 I said two fingers 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:29.550
 a trick 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.270
 when we run several times in a row outside we can 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.330
 put all his death 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.319
 meeting for the man it is easier to rotate several times 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.430

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.169

 because it's true anyone to teach me that music and rhythm 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.620
