perfect all right so that's gonna be

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.690 
perfect all right so that's gonna be
about<00:01:56.510> my<00:01:56.750> four<00:01:57.020> inches<00:01:57.320> I'm<00:01:58.070> gonna<00:01:58.250> add<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.670> a

recommend is just measuring by a
tablespoon<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.340> tablespoon<00:02:55.910> tends<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.330> be

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
tablespoon the tablespoon tends to be

usually better with fertilizer so pack

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.339 
usually better with fertilizer so pack
this<00:03:01.160> down

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349

about four inches and you're gonna put

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.199 
about four inches and you're gonna put
in<00:03:16.920> your<00:03:17.920> seat<00:03:18.159> potatoes<00:03:20.610> now<00:03:21.610> potatoes

actually you want to put up where the

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.440 
actually you want to put up where the
sprouts<00:03:25.569> are<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:27.190> loosen<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.579> little<00:03:27.849> bit<00:03:27.970> set

it's probably I'll be able to take five

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.410 
it's probably I'll be able to take five
potatoes<00:03:33.959> again<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.459> eye<00:03:36.489> side<00:03:36.879> up<00:03:37.090> where<00:03:37.299> the

sprouts<00:03:37.720> are<00:03:40.769> even<00:03:41.769> though<00:03:41.859> these<00:03:42.010> are<00:03:42.190> small

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
sprouts are even though these are small

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.910 
sprouts are even though these are small
you<00:03:42.519> can<00:03:42.819> see<00:03:43.000> them<00:03:43.090> right<00:03:43.239> there

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.149 

now<00:03:47.920> potatoes<00:03:48.489> form<00:03:49.530> growing<00:03:50.530> upwards<00:03:50.980> so

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
now potatoes form growing upwards so

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.770 
now potatoes form growing upwards so
it's<00:03:51.340> good<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.519> grow<00:03:51.700> down<00:03:51.940> into<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.389> is<00:03:52.599> the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
it's good to grow down into this is the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.629 
it's good to grow down into this is the
root<00:03:52.959> system<00:03:53.409> not<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:53.980> potatoes<00:03:54.489> you're

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
root system not the potatoes you're

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.949 
root system not the potatoes you're
gonna<00:03:54.819> harvest<00:03:55.060> I'm<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.540> gonna<00:03:55.629> go<00:03:55.810> with

gonna harvest I'm just gonna go with
four<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.319> could<00:03:56.470> put<00:03:56.620> into<00:03:56.769> fifth<00:03:56.980> one<00:03:57.159> I'm

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
four you could put into fifth one I'm

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.580 
four you could put into fifth one I'm
gonna<00:03:58.090> put<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.389> about<00:03:58.540> four<00:03:58.989> inches<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.409> soil

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
gonna put in about four inches of soil

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.559 
gonna put in about four inches of soil
across<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.129> top<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.639> and<00:04:00.879> then<00:04:01.359> when<00:04:01.480> the

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
across the top of this and then when the

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.479 
across the top of this and then when the
greenery<00:04:01.959> grows<00:04:02.230> up<00:04:02.409> six<00:04:02.709> inches<00:04:03.040> I'm<00:04:03.310> gonna

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
greenery grows up six inches I'm gonna

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.449 
greenery grows up six inches I'm gonna
add<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:03.879> more<00:04:04.209> soil<00:04:04.569> over<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.170> season<00:04:05.530> you

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
add in more soil over the season you

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.649 
add in more soil over the season you
know<00:04:06.549> over<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.760> season<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.269> reason<00:04:07.569> you

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
know over the season so the reason you

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.659 
know over the season so the reason you
do<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:08.049> because<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> potatoes<00:04:09.099> when

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
do that is because the potatoes when

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.280 
do that is because the potatoes when
this<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:09.970> green<00:04:10.239> stalk<00:04:10.599> up<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.930> here

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
this is a green stalk up to here

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.629 
this is a green stalk up to here
the<00:04:11.440> potatoes<00:04:11.859> are<00:04:11.889> actually<00:04:12.310> going<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.489> grow

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
the potatoes are actually going to grow

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.610 
the potatoes are actually going to grow
out<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.000> green<00:04:13.209> stalk<00:04:13.599> so<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.349> want<00:04:14.530> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
out of the green stalk so you want to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.640 
out of the green stalk so you want to
slowly<00:04:14.889> raise<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.699> soil<00:04:16.049> now<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.079> prepared

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
slowly raise the soil now I prepared

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.729 
slowly raise the soil now I prepared
some<00:04:17.859> soil<00:04:18.160> earlier<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:20.139> already<00:04:20.440> got<00:04:20.620> the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
some soil earlier it's already got the

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.040
