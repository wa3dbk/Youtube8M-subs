00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you've left the antifreeze in there so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
you've left the antifreeze in there so
it'll<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:26.939> safe<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> winner<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.869> release

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.220 
it's in Indiana so
generally<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.390> temperatures<00:02:12.840> don't<00:02:13.020> get

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
generally this temperatures don't get

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.860 
generally this temperatures don't get
that<00:02:13.410> cold<00:02:13.740> for<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.460> long<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.910> within<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that cold for very long and within the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
that cold for very long and within the
within<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:17.010> garage<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.490> back<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.880> garage

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
within my garage the back of the garage

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.150 
within my garage the back of the garage
sort<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> gets<00:02:19.260> heated<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:19.710> from<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> house

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
sort of gets heated a bit from the house

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160 
sort of gets heated a bit from the house
so<00:02:20.400> I'm<00:02:20.820> not<00:02:20.910> too<00:02:21.180> worried<00:02:21.480> about<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.690> cracking

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
so I'm not too worried about it cracking

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.380 
so I'm not too worried about it cracking
once<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.500> got<00:02:23.090> antifreeze<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:26.390> we'll

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
once it's got antifreeze in it so we'll

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.960 
once it's got antifreeze in it so we'll
start<00:02:27.600> folk<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> spin<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> bunch<00:02:29.850> of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
so I believe I plagiarized this but I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.520

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
because we're very hard to find a video

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.219 
because we're very hard to find a video
to<00:04:55.970> show<00:04:56.120> people<00:04:56.300> how<00:04:56.510> this<00:04:56.690> should<00:04:57.080> be<00:04:57.110> done
