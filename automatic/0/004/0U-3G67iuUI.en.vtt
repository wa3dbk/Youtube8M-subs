00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.319
 origami paper spiral 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello friends with you vital 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.679
 today we will make such a magical 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:23.240
 spiral 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:23.240
 for this we take a square we fold it 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.030
 in the afternoon everything to the centers 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:30.819
 this spiral is the most complicated spiral in 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.709
 anyway for me now our 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.209
 square 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:44.340
 turn over and now everything in it 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:44.340
 hand centered 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:03:06.950
 bent overturn now here about 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:03:12.080
 afternoon again and our directed now what 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:20.540
 we will now we are now going bends 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:23.540
 we will put the center that is, we can more easily 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.690
 was we let's bend 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:48.130
 in the opposite direction it will be much easier 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:48.130
 because bend it will be better and 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.760
 mash center opening of these ryan to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.760
 center 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:51.930
 prepare the shell rise to make it easier 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:05:03.490
 It was generally turned out such here 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:08.710
 Now we have a spinner to make it easier 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:13.060
 it was about bending we were just about 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.660
 all edges of attacks on half while everyone 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.660
 of problems 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.960
 everything 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:48.919
 and now there is the final touch and he 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.080
 the most difficult for this we are right 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:59.360
 the side 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:06:04.400

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:23.919
