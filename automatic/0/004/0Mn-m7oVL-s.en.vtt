00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.959
 Sunday for your clips 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.940
 this time I kept the 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.080
 format we say with the replay or otherwise 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.369
 should longer because i saw 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.839
 the other time you will be liked 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.759
 keep letting me know in the comments 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.380
 as always if you like this way 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.119
 from themes all the tips because how 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.369
 you know I answer you and accept them 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.749
 always so now let's not get lost in 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.919
 talk that in a while I go 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.990
 Also the sea because boys and 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.129
 tank top with a crazy heat and let's go 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.430
 to see immediately that there is the fifth 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:40.870
 position today here we are guys 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.629
 it is not the fifth position but the third 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.850
 you will see shortly why frank brings us 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.250
 tall on butterfield making from circles 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.750
 born crazy from incredible distance 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.210
 guys I put him in last place 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.109
 because really this week I'm in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.940
 mystical crisis 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.649
 so I ask you then to do the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.600
 anyway very complete classification a 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.840
 frank with 77 for these born circles 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.720
 crazy second place guys 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.440
 second position because they are there 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.120
 trick shots 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.890
 I'm not a great trick expert 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.660
 shot but on facebook I saw the tricks 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.150
 shot these that I brought you have not 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.300
 met with great success 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.860
 however here we have mahmood that there 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 brings a very well done trick shot 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.770
 in my opinion, however, put in second 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.470
 position with this other Irish coffee 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.390
 shop that brings us ye why why 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.020
 I think this is more complicated here 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.550
 this color 1 because in my opinion e 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.290
 must pass the projector towards more 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.760
 things and second things because it is more 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.240
 difficult to identify enemy yet 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.240
 positions 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.590
 first place boys port 2 stunt the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.390
 first is christian who gives us a stunt 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.620
 with the bike I never took the canal 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.780
 but I saw that there were still a lot of them 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.760
 difficult and very well-liked by you 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.500
 in short, the difficulty of this stand is 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.060
 first of all stay so balanced 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.410
 in the explained that already remain so 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 how it is balancing is 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.460
 difficult but above all the choice to 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.960
 you guys are seen jumping with the bce 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.640
 to pass a helicopter gallelli che in 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.399
 flight and do not finish chopped then 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.140
 complimentoni to christian first place 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.270
 guys I'll be repetitive but we have 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.040
 still our hicks black if where 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.250
 deserves first place compared to 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.489
 christian not so much for we say the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.080
 difficulty in launching now has us 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.420
 accustomed to these mileage launches but 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.450
 guys look at the perfect landing 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.550
 it is impossible to catch this building with 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.100
 this forecast and do not go anymore 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.840
 in short, the accuracy is shorter 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.180
 with which to land on the boys building 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.370
 so in my opinion hicks lech deserves the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.930
 first exposure by comparison we say 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.820
 at the stunt of christian ovviamentre 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.430
 let me know in the comments if I have 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.440
 well done I hurt and with this 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.880
 here we close our big ben e 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.709
 video guys ends here 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.330
 I hope you always liked me 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.580
 know in the comments if you think like 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.530
 for the ranking and nothing to do though 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.530
 everything we give ourselves beautiful next week
