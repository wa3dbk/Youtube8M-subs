00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello and welcome to those videos 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.379
 learning windows 8 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.150
 we will show you today 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:15.450
 how pinned an application a 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.160
 program on the home screen and commits 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.529
 also removed from the screen 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 host a tulle or an application 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.810
 or software that is pinned of course 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.300
 how do we do that it's very simple if 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.019
 you want pinned something to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 the home screen 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.350
 just find it first 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 when you are in windows 8 points 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 1 on the home screen at the bottom left 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.620
 there is a little arrow this one you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 shows all applications and all 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.450
 the software installed in your 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.539
 computer 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.219
 so just find the tulle that 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 you want pinned to your screen 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.730
 home so for example the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 calculator 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.780
 I have a free calculator here I 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 would like the calculator on my screen 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 Home 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.049
 I will therefore click the right button on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.260
 this oil and you will see a 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.460
 little icon that looks like a species 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.990
 of mini cloud a bug and it's bitter 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.450
 pinned to the home screen 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.750
 I will click on it immediately 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 she is always pinned to the extreme 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.689
 right 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.509
 so from that moment on you 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.400
 can take it and slide it a little 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.970
 anywhere where you want to see it in 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.790
 the computer simply 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.450
 and you leave it so I pinned the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.829
 calculator 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 now I have one of the tiles that I do not 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.079
 want more to see on my screen 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.670
 so I want to remove locates it but I 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.570
 do not want to uninstall the program 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.130
 because it's important 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.470
 there are two things you can do 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.590
 better sell a single one is either 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.090
 uninstall the software or any 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.280
 simply remove the tile so in this 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.549
 that if I would like to remove the tile 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.140
 but I would not want I do not want to 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.610
 that we remove the software example I 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.110
 the application the facebook tile here that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.270
 I do not use 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.300
 because I always go on facebook by the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.740
 web i want to remove this tile game 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.370
 right click on 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.890
 the tulle and you're going to have detached from 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.740
 the home screen you click and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.660
 immediately apply and want to 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.750
 close them but it is not 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.380
 deleted in the computer so 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.030
 detached or simply pinned the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.100
 two dull to use so you want 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.540
 pinned to the home screen where you 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.090
 want to detach from the home screen 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.140
 to add or delete tul it's 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.530
