00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
change the radar range to five so we can

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.230 
change the radar range to five so we can
see<00:02:26.280> what's<00:02:26.460> going<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:28.740> have<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.760> just

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
see what's going on we have here just

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.530 
see what's going on we have here just
approaching<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.260> runway<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:33.030> five<00:02:33.300> miles

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
approaching the runway about five miles

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.210 
approaching the runway about five miles
away<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.310> way<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.850> forgot<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.050> we<00:02:37.200> are<00:02:37.380> way

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
away we are way I forgot that we are way

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
away we are way I forgot that we are way
too<00:02:38.280> slow<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.210> need<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.660> increase<00:02:39.930> quite<00:02:40.320> a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
too slow so we need to increase quite a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.550 
too slow so we need to increase quite a
bit<00:02:40.620> maybe<00:02:41.450> closing<00:02:42.450> their<00:02:42.600> break<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.290> hard

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
bit maybe closing their break it's hard

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.510 
bit maybe closing their break it's hard
to<00:02:43.800> talk<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.380> fly<00:02:46.380> an<00:02:46.440> f-16<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> can

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
to talk and and fly an f-16 as you can

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.840 
to talk and and fly an f-16 as you can
imagine<00:02:47.700> um<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.800> speed<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.610> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
imagine um so the speed is going up and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.060 
imagine um so the speed is going up and
our<00:02:51.270> angle<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.810> attack<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:54.150> down<00:02:55.070> which

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
our angle of attack is going down which

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.940 
our angle of attack is going down which
is<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> little<00:02:56.490> bit<00:02:56.670> we're<00:02:57.090> going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.390> push<00:02:57.840> down

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
is a little bit we're going to push down

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.060 
is a little bit we're going to push down
to<00:02:58.950> go<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.400> 10<00:02:59.610> feet<00:02:59.880> 10<00:03:00.530> okay<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.770> are

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
to go back to 10 feet 10 okay now we are

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.250 
to go back to 10 feet 10 okay now we are
better<00:03:02.910> when<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.540> will<00:03:03.630> reduce<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:04.020> little<00:03:04.110> bit

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
better when it will reduce a little bit

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.660 
better when it will reduce a little bit
we're<00:03:07.260> at<00:03:07.380> way<00:03:07.709> back<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.250> switching

a thousand feet certain degrees were in
good<00:03:22.950> shape<00:03:24.080> as<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.140> can<00:03:25.739> see<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.250> also

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
good shape as you can see that also

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.780 
good shape as you can see that also
important<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.660> little<00:03:28.250> now<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.400> behind

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
important is that little now it's behind

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.660 
important is that little now it's behind
the<00:03:30.209> line<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> about<00:03:32.370> three

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
the line but this is the about three

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.320 
the line but this is the about three
degrees<00:03:32.850> peach<00:03:33.720> down<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.370> basically<00:03:36.000> if

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
degrees peach down this is basically if

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.560 
degrees peach down this is basically if
your<00:03:36.840> flight<00:03:37.800> path<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.850> line<00:03:39.150> this

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
your flight path is on that line this

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.370 
your flight path is on that line this
right<00:03:40.020> right<00:03:40.410> here<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.190> green<00:03:41.520> little<00:03:41.820> line

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
right right here this green little line

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.320 
right right here this green little line
dotted<00:03:43.380> line<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.770> your<00:03:44.700> minus<00:03:45.060> 2<00:03:45.300> degrees

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
dotted line is your minus 2 degrees

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.680 
dotted line is your minus 2 degrees
correctly<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:46.440> nope<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:48.000> means<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.420> if

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
correctly it's nope this means that if

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.930 
correctly it's nope this means that if
your<00:03:48.870> flight<00:03:49.470> path<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.340> line<00:03:50.640> it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
your flight path is on that line it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.050 
your flight path is on that line it
means<00:03:51.209> you're<00:03:51.360> going<00:03:51.540> down<00:03:52.340> three<00:03:53.340> degree

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
means you're going down three degree

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.690 
means you're going down three degree
down<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:55.140> slope<00:03:55.470> which<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.100> usually<00:03:56.459> what

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
down that slope which is usually what

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.199 
down that slope which is usually what
what<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.510> want<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.080> getting<00:03:58.560> down<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.890> a

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
what you want to do is getting down to a

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.660 
what you want to do is getting down to a
33<00:04:00.209> degree<00:04:00.739> minus<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.950> Greek<00:04:02.250> lights<00:04:02.459> up

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
33 degree minus the Greek lights up

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.850 
33 degree minus the Greek lights up
we're<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> little<00:04:03.930> bit<00:04:04.050> up<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.590> we're

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
we're going a little bit up so we're

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.390 
we're going a little bit up so we're
going<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.040> reduce<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.840> reduce<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
going to reduce the reduce the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.830 
going to reduce the reduce the
travel<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.460> little<00:04:09.580> bit<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:10.420> can<00:04:10.540> see<00:04:10.600> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
travel a little bit you can see the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.880 
travel a little bit you can see the
flight<00:04:11.050> path<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.560> much<00:04:11.920> higher<00:04:12.130> than<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.730> this

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
flight path is much higher than the this

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.390 
flight path is much higher than the this
this<00:04:14.890> minus<00:04:15.550> 3<00:04:15.790> degrees<00:04:16.440> flat<00:04:17.440> slope<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.130> you

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
this minus 3 degrees flat slope and you

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.170 
this minus 3 degrees flat slope and you
can<00:04:18.550> going<00:04:18.820> down<00:04:18.910> now<00:04:19.470> we're<00:04:20.470> going<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:21.180> wait

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
can going down now we're going to wait

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.330 
can going down now we're going to wait
until<00:04:22.360> we<00:04:22.570> get<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.840> 3d<00:04:23.140> certain<00:04:23.680> degrees<00:04:23.980> and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
until we get the 3d certain degrees and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.680 
until we get the 3d certain degrees and
then<00:04:24.790> or<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.460> term<00:04:27.910> point<00:04:28.120> thing<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.510> watch

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
then or so the term point thing to watch

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.210 
then or so the term point thing to watch
is<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:30.010> arm<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:32.200> can<00:04:32.380> cross<00:04:32.620> about<00:04:32.950> 10

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
is is the arm you can cross about 10

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.980 
is is the arm you can cross about 10
degrees<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.000> your<00:04:34.240> flight<00:04:34.570> path<00:04:34.780> around

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990

care because this is really important is

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.859 
care because this is really important is
the<00:05:28.079> angular<00:05:28.589> attack<00:05:28.979> looks<00:05:29.429> good<00:05:29.610> we<00:05:30.539> just

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:30.869 
the angular attack looks good we just

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:34.489 
the angular attack looks good we just
reach<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.619> threshold<00:05:32.610> of<00:05:33.059> the<00:05:33.899> runway<00:05:34.259> will

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499 
reach the threshold of the runway will

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.850 
reach the threshold of the runway will
last<00:05:35.059> the<00:05:36.059> ILS<00:05:36.479> because<00:05:37.349> we're<00:05:37.529> very<00:05:37.559> close

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
last the ILS because we're very close

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.469 
last the ILS because we're very close
and<00:05:38.279> we<00:05:39.029> have<00:05:39.149> point<00:05:39.389> three<00:05:39.689> point<00:05:39.809> four<00:05:40.289> miles

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
and we have point three point four miles

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.819 
and we have point three point four miles
inside<00:05:42.479> the<00:05:42.659> runway<00:05:42.989> and<00:05:43.229> you<00:05:43.439> can<00:05:43.589> see<00:05:43.800> that

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:43.829 
inside the runway and you can see that

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:46.429 
inside the runway and you can see that
it's<00:05:44.189> red<00:05:44.519> meaning<00:05:45.509> that<00:05:45.749> you<00:05:45.899> are<00:05:46.019> you're

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:46.439 
it's red meaning that you are you're

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.709 
it's red meaning that you are you're
flying<00:05:46.769> over<00:05:47.009> the<00:05:47.339> runway<00:05:47.639> you<00:05:48.269> want<00:05:48.449> to<00:05:48.539> land

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
flying over the runway you want to land

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.889 
flying over the runway you want to land
when<00:05:49.079> this<00:05:49.259> is<00:05:49.319> red<00:05:49.679> if<00:05:50.429> you<00:05:50.579> this<00:05:50.789> is<00:05:50.939> white<00:05:51.209> if

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:51.899 
when this is red if you this is white if

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.929 
when this is red if you this is white if
the<00:05:52.079> range<00:05:52.259> is<00:05:52.379> white<00:05:52.589> then<00:05:53.429> it<00:05:53.519> means<00:05:53.610> you're

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:53.939 
the range is white then it means you're

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.009 
the range is white then it means you're
outside<00:05:54.239> the<00:05:54.419> runway<00:05:54.769> we<00:05:55.769> are<00:05:55.919> 50<00:05:56.309> feet<00:05:57.019> will

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:58.019 
outside the runway we are 50 feet will

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.069 
outside the runway we are 50 feet will
will<00:05:58.919> cut<00:05:59.129> along<00:05:59.429> the<00:05:59.489> thing<00:06:00.149> so<00:06:00.389> we're<00:06:00.569> on<00:06:00.899> the

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:01.079 
will cut along the thing so we're on the

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.579 
will cut along the thing so we're on the
end<00:06:01.259> of<00:06:01.379> attack<00:06:01.649> so<00:06:02.189> we're<00:06:02.369> going<00:06:02.519> to<00:06:03.499> act<00:06:04.499> like

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589 
end of attack so we're going to act like

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.949 
end of attack so we're going to act like
it's<00:06:04.829> too<00:06:04.949> late<00:06:05.069> now<00:06:05.129> it's<00:06:05.669> ok<00:06:05.939> we're<00:06:06.689> going<00:06:06.839> to

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:06.959 
it's too late now it's ok we're going to

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.409 
it's too late now it's ok we're going to
reduce<00:06:07.289> the<00:06:07.559> threshold<00:06:08.339> the<00:06:08.849> throttle<00:06:09.389> to

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
reduce the threshold the throttle to

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.350 
reduce the threshold the throttle to
minimum<00:06:09.929> idol<00:06:10.559> so<00:06:11.309> that<00:06:11.519> we<00:06:11.639> can<00:06:11.789> break<00:06:12.029> and

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
minimum idol so that we can break and

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.749 
minimum idol so that we can break and
you<00:06:12.479> can<00:06:12.659> see<00:06:12.869> the<00:06:12.899> the<00:06:13.860> nose<00:06:14.069> of<00:06:14.249> the<00:06:14.339> plane<00:06:14.459> is

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
you can see the the nose of the plane is

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.059 
you can see the the nose of the plane is
at<00:06:14.909> 10<00:06:15.149> degree<00:06:15.449> up<00:06:15.739> meaning<00:06:16.739> that<00:06:16.889> you're

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
at 10 degree up meaning that you're

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.569 
at 10 degree up meaning that you're
using<00:06:17.249> the<00:06:17.519> f16<00:06:18.149> body<00:06:18.419> to<00:06:19.110> do<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.039> breaking<00:06:20.459> as

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:20.579 
using the f16 body to do the breaking as

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:24.350 
using the f16 body to do the breaking as
well<00:06:20.729> oh<00:06:20.969> I<00:06:21.599> forgot<00:06:22.139> to<00:06:22.519> sorry<00:06:23.519> forgot<00:06:24.059> to<00:06:24.239> turn

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
well oh I forgot to sorry forgot to turn

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.209 
well oh I forgot to sorry forgot to turn
on<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.539> air<00:06:24.779> brake<00:06:25.079> as<00:06:25.229> well<00:06:25.409> and<00:06:25.769> you<00:06:25.860> can<00:06:25.889> see

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
on the air brake as well and you can see

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.169 
on the air brake as well and you can see
that<00:06:26.249> the<00:06:27.499> the<00:06:28.519> nose<00:06:29.519> the<00:06:29.699> planes<00:06:29.879> going<00:06:30.089> down

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:30.179 
that the the nose the planes going down

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:33.169 
that the the nose the planes going down
slowly<00:06:30.569> as<00:06:30.899> your<00:06:31.589> speed<00:06:31.889> goes<00:06:32.099> down<00:06:32.309> it<00:06:33.149> just

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:33.179 
slowly as your speed goes down it just

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:35.479 
slowly as your speed goes down it just
means<00:06:33.509> that<00:06:33.599> the<00:06:34.439> speak<00:06:34.709> on<00:06:34.889> that<00:06:34.919> going<00:06:35.369> down

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:35.489 
means that the speak on that going down

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:39.589 
means that the speak on that going down
you<00:06:35.610> have<00:06:35.699> less<00:06:35.909> lift<00:06:37.639> from<00:06:38.639> your<00:06:38.699> the<00:06:39.300> body<00:06:39.479> of

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
you have less lift from your the body of

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.359 
you have less lift from your the body of
the<00:06:39.689> f-16<00:06:40.349> and<00:06:40.829> you<00:06:41.789> can<00:06:41.909> hear<00:06:42.029> the<00:06:42.089> brake

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:43.369 
the f-16 and you can hear the brake

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.909 
the f-16 and you can hear the brake
making<00:06:44.369> noise<00:06:44.929> hopefully<00:06:45.929> I<00:06:46.199> guess<00:06:46.559> we<00:06:46.739> are

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
making noise hopefully I guess we are

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.619 
making noise hopefully I guess we are
those<00:06:47.579> are<00:06:47.729> all<00:06:47.849> really<00:06:47.879> good<00:06:48.119> lending

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
those are all really good lending

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.839 
those are all really good lending
because<00:06:48.989> we<00:06:49.429> we<00:06:50.429> pass<00:06:50.759> the<00:06:50.969> runway<00:06:52.429> like<00:06:53.429> where

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
because we we pass the runway like where

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.269 
because we we pass the runway like where
is<00:06:53.969> mud<00:06:54.749> not<00:06:55.079> much<00:06:55.289> but<00:06:55.559> we<00:06:55.709> still<00:06:55.889> catch<00:06:56.129> the

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:56.279 
is mud not much but we still catch the

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:59.950 
is mud not much but we still catch the
runway<00:06:56.639> at<00:06:57.239> least<00:06:57.449> point2<00:06:57.959> mile

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
runway at least point2 mile

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.820 
runway at least point2 mile
about<00:07:00.960> 1,200<00:07:01.950> feet<00:07:03.380> but<00:07:04.380> it's<00:07:04.530> okay<00:07:04.740> for<00:07:05.280> this

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
about 1,200 feet but it's okay for this

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.580 
about 1,200 feet but it's okay for this
for<00:07:07.830> this<00:07:07.860> tutorial<00:07:08.220> that's<00:07:09.000> good<00:07:09.300> enough<00:07:09.590> the

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
for this tutorial that's good enough the

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.160 
for this tutorial that's good enough the
main<00:07:10.770> thing<00:07:10.800> is<00:07:11.010> we<00:07:11.160> lost<00:07:11.490> we<00:07:11.820> landed<00:07:12.600> about<00:07:12.840> 12

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.170 
main thing is we lost we landed about 12

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.680 
main thing is we lost we landed about 12
degrees<00:07:13.320> which<00:07:13.800> is<00:07:13.950> not<00:07:14.130> bad<00:07:14.600> searching<00:07:15.600> is

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
degrees which is not bad searching is

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.170 
degrees which is not bad searching is
better<00:07:15.900> and<00:07:16.650> but<00:07:16.980> we<00:07:17.130> definitely<00:07:17.580> not<00:07:18.030> it

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
better and but we definitely not it

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.710 
better and but we definitely not it
outside<00:07:18.570> them<00:07:18.780> the<00:07:19.940> we<00:07:20.940> definitely<00:07:21.390> landed

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
outside them the we definitely landed

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.500 
outside them the we definitely landed
outside<00:07:21.930> the<00:07:24.680> runway<00:07:26.000> and<00:07:27.000> you<00:07:27.120> can<00:07:27.300> see<00:07:27.480> that

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
outside the runway and you can see that

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.050 
outside the runway and you can see that
the<00:07:27.720> lengthy<00:07:28.020> distance<00:07:28.410> is<00:07:28.560> pretty<00:07:29.040> high<00:07:29.160> the

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
the lengthy distance is pretty high the

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.130 
the lengthy distance is pretty high the
landing<00:07:31.280> this<00:07:32.280> is<00:07:32.460> wrong<00:07:32.700> this<00:07:32.730> is<00:07:33.210> should<00:07:33.990> be

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140 
landing this is wrong this is should be
