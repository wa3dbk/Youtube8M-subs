00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
because my poncho has broken it's just

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.960 
because my poncho has broken it's just
nice<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.570> finish<00:01:45.649> with<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> clear<00:01:47.070> sky<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> it's

nice to finish with a clear sky so it's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
nice to finish with a clear sky so it's
been<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.649> 14<00:01:53.399> miles<00:01:53.700> today<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.979> it's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
been I think 14 miles today and it's

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.999 
been I think 14 miles today and it's
taking<00:01:56.430> me<00:01:56.579> an<00:01:56.820> extremely<00:01:57.810> long<00:01:58.020> time<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
taking me an extremely long time just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.480 
taking me an extremely long time just
because<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> conditions<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.140> trail

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
because of the conditions of the trail

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.000 
because of the conditions of the trail
with<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.520> snow<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.540> weather

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
with the snow and the weather

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.190 
with the snow and the weather
um<00:02:05.900> so<00:02:06.900> I'm<00:02:07.260> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.590> tired<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
um so I'm kind of tired and

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.170

unfortunately once I reach the monument
I<00:02:12.720> still<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.470> another<00:02:13.760> eight<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.240> nine<00:02:16.140> miles

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
hopefully hopefully as fuller would say

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.890 
hopefully hopefully as fuller would say
it<00:02:27.600> might<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.440> bit<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> float<00:02:29.220> walk

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
it might be a bit of a float walk

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.660 
it might be a bit of a float walk
