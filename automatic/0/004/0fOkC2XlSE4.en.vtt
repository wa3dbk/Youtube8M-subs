medium<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.719> I<00:01:53.960> think<00:01:54.259> there<00:01:54.439> was<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.560> few

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.450 
medium and I think there was a few
medium<00:01:56.659> that<00:01:56.869> we<00:01:57.020> actually<00:01:57.530> successfully<00:01:58.280> did
