00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
pred of the gene it actually very much

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
back of the leg so if you have really

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.439 
back of the leg so if you have really
beefy<00:04:06.410> legs<00:04:06.620> are<00:04:06.799> really<00:04:07.069> large<00:04:07.489> caps<00:04:07.910> you

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
beefy legs are really large caps you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.939 
beefy legs are really large caps you
might<00:04:08.690> start<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.989> run<00:04:09.230> out<00:04:09.379> of<00:04:09.410> room<00:04:09.530> when<00:04:09.859> you

might start to run out of room when you

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.650 
might start to run out of room when you
are<00:04:10.129> going<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.459> use<00:04:10.609> that<00:04:10.790> kit<00:04:11.030> J<00:04:11.239> version<00:04:11.569> in

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
are going to use that kit J version in

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.819 
are going to use that kit J version in
the<00:04:11.750> Predators<00:04:12.139> and<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.379> might<00:04:12.560> be<00:04:12.680> better

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
the Predators and you might be better

a couple other comfort and safety
options<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.430> want<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.670> talk<00:05:01.790> about<00:05:01.940> here<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.480> the

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
options I want to talk about here on the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.290 
options I want to talk about here on the
d1<00:05:02.990> Evo<00:05:03.350> notice<00:05:03.950> they<00:05:04.190> added<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.610> gusset<00:05:05.090> into

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
d1 Evo notice they added a gusset into

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.180 
d1 Evo notice they added a gusset into
the<00:05:05.390> crotch<00:05:05.630> that's<00:05:06.110> for<00:05:06.380> better<00:05:06.530> comfort<00:05:06.890> in

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
the crotch that's for better comfort in

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.040 
the crotch that's for better comfort in
the<00:05:07.340> riding<00:05:07.610> position<00:05:07.850> we<00:05:08.300> did<00:05:08.570> not<00:05:08.720> see<00:05:09.020> that

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
the riding position we did not see that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.050 
the riding position we did not see that
on<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.470> original<00:05:09.860> d1<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:10.640> that's<00:05:10.790> a<00:05:10.910> nice

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
on the original d1 so that's a nice

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.090 
on the original d1 so that's a nice
improvement<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.930> almost<00:05:12.170> forgot<00:05:12.740> if<00:05:12.980> you

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
improvement and I almost forgot if you

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.680 
improvement and I almost forgot if you
slide<00:05:13.370> down<00:05:13.400> here<00:05:13.760> all<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.000> way<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.480> cuff

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
slide down here all the way to the cuff

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.210 
slide down here all the way to the cuff
notice<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.290> we<00:05:15.380> have<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.530> cuff<00:05:15.680> gives<00:05:15.950> six

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
notice that we have a cuff gives six

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.070 
notice that we have a cuff gives six
inches<00:05:16.520> or<00:05:16.670> reflectivity<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.720> work<00:05:17.900> their

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
inches or reflectivity that work their

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.900 
inches or reflectivity that work their
way<00:05:18.170> about<00:05:18.410> that<00:05:18.680> high<00:05:18.920> up<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.340> inside<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.820> the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
way about that high up the inside of the

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.370 
way about that high up the inside of the
cuff<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.300> we're<00:05:20.570> going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.750> have<00:05:20.930> is<00:05:21.110> if<00:05:21.290> you

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
cuff so we're going to have is if you

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.020 
cuff so we're going to have is if you
decide<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.680> cuff<00:05:21.950> it<00:05:22.130> for<00:05:22.310> nighttime<00:05:22.520> riding

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
decide to cuff it for nighttime riding

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.250 
decide to cuff it for nighttime riding
you<00:05:23.090> get<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.300> extra<00:05:23.510> popper<00:05:23.870> reflectivity

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
you get that extra popper reflectivity

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.840 
you get that extra popper reflectivity
so<00:05:24.710> if<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:24.890> have<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.220> hem<00:05:25.370> them<00:05:25.520> you're<00:05:25.700> still

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
so if you have to hem them you're still

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.370 
so if you have to hem them you're still
going<00:05:26.030> to<00:05:26.060> have<00:05:26.180> plenty<00:05:26.390> of<00:05:26.510> reflective<00:05:27.110> left

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
going to have plenty of reflective left

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.920 
going to have plenty of reflective left
over<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.220> remember<00:05:28.580> made<00:05:28.940> in<00:05:29.060> Italy<00:05:29.420> the<00:05:29.660> next

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
over so remember made in Italy the next

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.020 
over so remember made in Italy the next
