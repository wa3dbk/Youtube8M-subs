a tweet yesterday asking whether the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
a tweet yesterday asking whether the

be improved your reply saying yes the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.330 
be improved your reply saying yes the
penalty<00:00:38.850> system<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.600> no<00:00:40.079> longer<00:00:40.340> super

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
penalty system is no longer super

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
penalty system is no longer super
annoying<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.510> think<00:00:42.840> that's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.440> thing

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
annoying so I think that's a big thing

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
annoying so I think that's a big thing
that<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> game<00:00:44.250> developers<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:45.059> realize<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that the game developers do realize that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.190 
that the game developers do realize that
the<00:00:45.989> penalty<00:00:46.620> system<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.700> quite<00:00:48.539> annoying<00:00:48.899> in

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the penalty system was quite annoying in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.709 
the penalty system was quite annoying in
f1<00:00:49.559> 2012<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.969> was<00:00:51.059> especially<00:00:51.239> online

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
f1 2012 I think it was especially online

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
f1 2012 I think it was especially online
we<00:00:52.199> had<00:00:52.320> quite<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> problems<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.489> sort

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
we had quite a lot of problems with sort

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
we had quite a lot of problems with sort
of<00:00:53.789> undeserved<00:00:54.420> penalties<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> fact<00:00:55.620> now

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
of undeserved penalties and the fact now

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
of undeserved penalties and the fact now
that<00:00:55.800> they've<00:00:56.100> looked<00:00:56.370> into<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> penalty

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that they've looked into this penalty

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.569 
that they've looked into this penalty
system<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.960> made<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.859> better<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
system and made it even better is a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.299 
system and made it even better is a
great<00:01:00.000> thing<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.570> mean<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> think<00:01:01.620> personally

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
great thing I mean I think personally

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
great thing I mean I think personally
the<00:01:02.430> penalty<00:01:02.850> system<00:01:03.170> made<00:01:04.170> sort<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> took<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the penalty system made sort of took a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.370 
the penalty system made sort of took a
little<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.280> dip<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.760> f1<00:01:06.450> 2012<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> think

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
little bit of a dip in f1 2012 I think

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.190 
little bit of a dip in f1 2012 I think
it<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.710> better<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.220> 2010<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.820> 2011<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
it was better in 2010 and 2011 but it is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480 
it was better in 2010 and 2011 but it is
great<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.280> sort<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
great to see that they have sort of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.950 
great to see that they have sort of
looked<00:01:11.790> into<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.210> they've<00:01:12.360> thought<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
looked into it they've thought this is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.630 
looked into it they've thought this is
one<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> big<00:01:13.470> things<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.920> people<00:01:14.100> want

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
one of the big things that people want

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.420 
one of the big things that people want
is<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.090> better<00:01:15.479> penalty<00:01:16.229> system<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.189> fact

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is a better penalty system and the fact

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
is a better penalty system and the fact
that<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:17.670> getting<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.659> good

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that we're getting it is a really good

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.399 
that we're getting it is a really good
thing<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.729> can't<00:01:20.970> wait<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
thing and I really can't wait to see the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
thing and I really can't wait to see the
the<00:01:22.740> penalty<00:01:23.100> system<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.549> action<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.030> year

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the penalty system in action this year

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
the penalty system in action this year
because<00:01:24.479> obviously<00:01:25.020> each<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.890> every<00:01:26.100> year

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
because obviously each and every year

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.770 
because obviously each and every year
the<00:01:26.369> penalty<00:01:26.729> systems<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.600> bit

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the penalty systems a little bit

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
the penalty systems a little bit
different<00:01:28.290> 2012<00:01:29.070> wasn't<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.790> great<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> think

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
different 2012 wasn't that great I think

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.969 
different 2012 wasn't that great I think
we<00:01:30.479> could<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.110> honest<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
we could all be very honest about that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
we could all be very honest about that
it<00:01:32.369> wasn't<00:01:32.850> too<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.060> even<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.659> you're<00:01:33.780> our

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it wasn't too good even if you're our

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.100 
it wasn't too good even if you're our
massive<00:01:34.350> fan<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> game<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.189> myself<00:01:35.369> and

to do so on the Xbox 360 I got the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.630 
to do so on the Xbox 360 I got the
classic<00:02:52.260> Edition<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.250> should<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.550> all

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
classic Edition so that should be all

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760 
classic Edition so that should be all
good<00:02:53.670> hopefully<00:02:54.600> get<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:54.900> much<00:02:55.140> content<00:02:55.680> on

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
good hopefully get as much content on

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.640 
good hopefully get as much content on
the<00:02:55.890> classic<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.430> new<00:02:56.970> stuff<00:02:57.270> as<00:02:57.480> possible

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
the classic and new stuff as possible

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.650 
the classic and new stuff as possible
and<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:59.340> looking<00:02:59.730> unlikely<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.510> had<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and it's looking unlikely what we had to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.380 
and it's looking unlikely what we had to
doing<00:03:00.870> classically<00:03:01.380> sadly<00:03:01.890> due<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.730> has

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
doing classically sadly due to what has

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.280 
doing classically sadly due to what has
been<00:03:03.540> taught<00:03:03.690> released<00:03:03.989> over<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.230> last

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
couple of weeks I don't think really

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.640 
couple of weeks I don't think really
anybody's<00:03:07.050> going<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.350> able<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.620> a
