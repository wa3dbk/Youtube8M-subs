00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.100
 from the first moment I knew I was going 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.080
 to do the crossing yes or yes 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.639
 think about throwing in the towel never the only 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.520
 that I have considered is not to do the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.440
 race and do it on my own but 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.020
 always from the minute 1 that travel to 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.119
 france in the type of boat already 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.460
 see the organization it was clear that what 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.840
 would do with the trait organization no longer 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.460
 without organizing the yang trait but I 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.520
 he was clear that he was going to try to cross the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.520
 Atlantic 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.850
 luck 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.310
 yes known antonio with much joy 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.550
 It has a lot of spirit and I think 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.000
 that the favorite this Spanish boy is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.000
 very strong 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.719
 I'm noticing the stop 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.640
 good 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.950
 Let's go of sensations are good 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 to see if I advance 45 days 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.320
 I feel good I hope to make the crossing 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.380
 in the best case, be close to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.480
 40 days but this year starts very soon 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.390
 the traverse the trade winds have barely 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.130
 started and possibly I'll be more 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.130
 about 50 days out of 40 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.280
 about my experience navigating the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.200
 sea is practically nil there would be nate 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 something maybe close to someone who had 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.580
 more knowledge in navigation theme 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.120
 but but good in the end what I like 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.800
 is to train and I have trained I am very 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.479
 well prepared I made a preparation 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.130
 specific the last months for this 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.760
 crossing that I think will go very 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.280
 well and I hope that the knowledge of 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.440
 navigation that I barely have not be 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.890
 necessary to be able to reach the other 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.890
 side of the Atlantic 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 right now I am possibly carrying 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.930
 of all the boats be the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.180
 oldest boat demarcations 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.070
 of 2006 well he has some 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.080
 accessories that are old that are 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.010
 fenced all thousands and thousands and thousands of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 euros then I will not bear it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.330
 I will stand and think that I have to paddle 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.820
 a little more to be at the height of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.350
 my rivals as the important thing in the end 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.240
 is to cross this boat is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.010
 ready to cross the Atlantic 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.270
 another thing is that good to move 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 a little slower to the best that the 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.400
 but I will try to give everything 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.490
 with security safety security 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.490
 If you are not asked to hold a session 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.110
 I do not know anything that does not know that I have 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.980
 said the fishmongers here that they 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.510
 they do not know anything , nothing happens 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.510
 and that many know sinners
