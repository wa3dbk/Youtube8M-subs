00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.369 
gameplay so yeah guys this is also in
hardcore<00:02:24.879> if<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.209> didn't<00:02:25.390> say<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.510> yet<00:02:25.870> he

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
hardcore if I didn't say that yet he

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.440 
hardcore if I didn't say that yet he
this<00:02:26.739> makes<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.489> much<00:02:27.760> more<00:02:28.030> harder<00:02:28.299> because

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
this makes it much more harder because

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.209 
this makes it much more harder because
he<00:02:28.689> can<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:28.959> get<00:02:29.140> killed<00:02:29.379> off<00:02:29.500> easily<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.980> mean

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
one shot you could just possibly die but

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.440 
one shot you could just possibly die but
you<00:02:32.680> know<00:02:32.799> instant<00:02:33.250> head<00:02:33.340> shots<00:02:33.609> but<00:02:33.879> you<00:02:34.329> know

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450
