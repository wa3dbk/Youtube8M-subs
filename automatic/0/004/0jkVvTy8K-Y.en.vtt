 speed bernard this time it tackles 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.099
 at the slowest the magnificent tennis a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.780
 replica of barges 33 meters 80 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.089

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 recovers in particular the deck hatches 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.940
 Bernard explains me it's not our 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.359
 extraordinary point down the plates 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.220
 are made with the cake box the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.199
 cake boxes kind the little ones 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 let's bretons the image something like that the game 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.269
 cuts in thanks to these two there 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.410
 that the angles that I made because 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.489
 with over zinc plates 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.750
 then that's the phone line under 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 demons his seams joigny 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 would not explain explain us besides 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.450
 how did you manage the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 retraction of metals when you 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.469
 soldering a cock and I did I passed 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.789
 like that of a piece of wood that arises 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.590
 is a moose-type mold without 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.020
 to confess I have indeed to gauge gallery 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.059
 extended to the card comes out and started to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.410
 heat from top to bottom in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.120
 going to their fate like that the son 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.949
 remains tense is what is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 just I just have that and turn 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.119
 to know how much sales do not dare no 29 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 panels so 58 angles 58 son of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.290
 copper would be in Ouidah taf 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 reality is other the elements there the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.780
 doors the doors down everyone 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 use it when it's bad weather 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.979
 like today it's whales from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 umbrella in time it misses yes it's 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 whales umbrellas nÃ®mois tweet 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.439
 had a lot of trouble and high schools of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.729
 steel is sitting down like that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.460
 store if we arrive at the door anyway 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 finally it's very beefy it's easy to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.760
 solder to the pond also if we break 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.170
 mud that would be nice it's convenient and 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.110
 it's very strong because what we 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.570
 was selling safe for scale 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.690
 above 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.400
 the water will leave on the sides that can 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.960
 that's what google office do 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.030
