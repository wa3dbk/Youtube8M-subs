00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
using a mixture of metal and wood to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
using a mixture of metal and wood to
keep<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.250> metal<00:00:44.700> costs<00:00:45.090> down<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.750> metals<00:00:46.350> do

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
keep the metal costs down as metals do

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.470 
keep the metal costs down as metals do
cost<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:48.030> than<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> woods<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> recipe

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
cost more than the woods in this recipe

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
cost more than the woods in this recipe
so<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> two<00:00:53.760> ways<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
so you can do this one of two ways you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
so you can do this one of two ways you
can<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> way<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
can do it the way I do it which is to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.619 
can do it the way I do it which is to
craft<00:00:56.399> them<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.320> usually<00:00:58.320> costs<00:00:58.949> me

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
craft them and this usually costs me

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.529 
craft them and this usually costs me
approximately<00:01:00.629> 14<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.649> 16<00:01:01.949> silver<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.239> craft

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
approximately 14 to 16 silver to craft

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.060 
approximately 14 to 16 silver to craft
one<00:01:03.840> carry<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> create<00:01:04.619> battle<00:01:04.949> axe<00:01:07.070> you

one carry and create battle axe you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.580 
one carry and create battle axe you
obviously<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.060> forward<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
obviously then can go forward and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
obviously then can go forward and
salvage<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> chance<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.000> ectoplasm
