let's look along this stem because this
stem<00:01:59.820> has<00:01:59.969> been<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.750> flower<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> while

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
stem has been out of flower for a while

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
stem has been out of flower for a while
see<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:04.049> know<00:02:04.200> whether<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.710> my

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
see I don't know whether you can see my

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
see I don't know whether you can see my
fingers<00:02:05.159> are<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.509> there's<00:02:06.509> new<00:02:06.659> growth

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
fingers are here there's new growth

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.729 
fingers are here there's new growth
starting<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.770> whose<00:02:08.429> new<00:02:08.640> growth<00:02:08.849> starting

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
starting here whose new growth starting

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.390 
starting here whose new growth starting
here<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:12.030> basically<00:02:12.720> along<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> stem

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
here and just basically along the stem

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 
here and just basically along the stem
there's<00:02:14.790> new<00:02:14.969> growth<00:02:15.000> starting<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> want<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
there's new growth starting so I want to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.610 
there's new growth starting so I want to
cut<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.769> back<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.459> way<00:02:17.790> back<00:02:18.379> probably<00:02:19.379> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
cut it back way way back probably to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.849 
cut it back way way back probably to
about<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:20.189> this<00:02:20.700> area<00:02:20.909> here<00:02:21.829> which<00:02:22.829> is

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
about this this area here which is

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.369 
about this this area here which is
probably<00:02:23.340> about<00:02:23.670> ten<00:02:24.420> or<00:02:24.540> twelve<00:02:24.569> inches<00:02:25.079> from

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
probably about ten or twelve inches from

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.550 
probably about ten or twelve inches from
the<00:02:25.530> center<00:02:25.969> point<00:02:26.969> so<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:28.140> where<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.349> want

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the center point so that's where I want

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.099 
the center point so that's where I want
it<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:29.310> take<00:02:29.579> hold<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.969> these<00:02:30.689> these

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
it to really take hold and these these

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.830 
it to really take hold and these these
areas<00:02:31.439> here<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.069> are<00:02:32.969> just<00:02:33.269> finishing

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
areas here that are just finishing

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.619 
areas here that are just finishing
flowering<00:02:34.319> they<00:02:35.159> don't<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:35.879> have<00:02:36.150> any<00:02:36.389> new

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
flowering they don't really have any new

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.160 
flowering they don't really have any new
growth<00:02:36.870> started<00:02:37.739> maybe<00:02:38.489> one<00:02:38.790> or<00:02:38.909> two<00:02:38.939> spots<00:02:39.569> so

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
growth started maybe one or two spots so

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.379 
growth started maybe one or two spots so
if<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.650> prune<00:02:40.920> these<00:02:41.129> now<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.329> to

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
if I prune these now it's going to

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.970 
if I prune these now it's going to
really<00:02:42.659> force<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.200> new<00:02:43.290> growth<00:02:43.530> into<00:02:43.829> this

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
really force the new growth into this

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.920 
really force the new growth into this
zone<00:02:44.219> here<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.730> that's<00:02:45.329> what<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.510> want<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.810> see

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
zone here and that's what I want to see

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.099 
zone here and that's what I want to see
happen<00:02:46.439> and<00:02:46.970> these<00:02:47.970> ones<00:02:48.239> here<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.720> still

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
happen and these ones here that still

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.589 
happen and these ones here that still
have<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.859> good<00:02:50.069> flowers<00:02:50.549> there's<00:02:51.389> really

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
have the the good flowers there's really

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.099 
have the the good flowers there's really
not<00:02:51.840> any<00:02:52.200> any<00:02:53.069> new<00:02:53.310> growth<00:02:53.549> occurring<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.569> do

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
not any any new growth occurring I do

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.559 
not any any new growth occurring I do
see<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.739> there's<00:02:55.980> there's<00:02:56.370> nodes<00:02:56.790> here<00:02:57.269> that

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
see that there's there's nodes here that

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.569 
see that there's there's nodes here that
that<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:58.019> going<00:02:58.169> to<00:02:58.230> start<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.709> produce<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.280> see

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
that are going to start to produce I see

that are going to start to produce I see
that<00:02:59.760> there's<00:02:59.939> swelling<00:03:00.689> buds<00:03:01.049> right<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.769> by

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889

this thing back it's going to it's going
to<00:03:14.609> be<00:03:14.700> sad<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.450> really<00:03:16.319> will<00:03:16.799> but<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.489> time

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
to be sad it really will but in time

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.270 
to be sad it really will but in time
it'll<00:03:18.150> look<00:03:18.239> beautiful<00:03:18.949> okay<00:03:19.949> so<00:03:20.010> I've<00:03:20.250> got

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
freshly sterilized pruners I've actually

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.219 
freshly sterilized pruners I've actually
cleaned<00:03:23.609> them<00:03:23.760> right<00:03:23.940> up<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.049> lot<00:03:25.169> of

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
so like I said here's the central point

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.960 
so like I said here's the central point
here<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.479> the<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.470> tree<00:03:31.949> so<00:03:32.699> I'm<00:03:32.790> just

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
here of the of the tree so I'm just

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.589 
here of the of the tree so I'm just
going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.269> trim<00:03:37.099> branches<00:03:38.099> off<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:39.120> above<00:03:39.449> a

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
going to trim branches off just above a

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.960 
going to trim branches off just above a
leaf<00:03:39.780> node<00:03:40.069> I'll<00:03:41.069> bring<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.669> a<00:03:41.699> little<00:03:41.849> bit

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
leaf node I'll bring you it a little bit

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.599 
leaf node I'll bring you it a little bit
closer<00:03:42.180> I'll<00:03:42.449> show<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:42.689> where<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:42.930> trimmed<00:03:43.609> in

for<00:04:12.730> what<00:04:13.060> I'm<00:04:13.329> trying<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.959> achieve<00:04:14.469> with<00:04:14.739> this

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
for what I'm trying to achieve with this

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.990 
for what I'm trying to achieve with this
plant<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.889> fun<00:04:18.099> thing<00:04:18.250> about<00:04:18.280> these<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:18.699> they

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
plant the fun thing about these is they

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.029 
plant the fun thing about these is they
tend<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.389> grow<00:04:19.570> really<00:04:19.780> really<00:04:20.079> quickly<00:04:20.320> so

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
tend to grow really really quickly so

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.890 
tend to grow really really quickly so
you<00:04:21.579> can<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:21.970> can<00:04:22.090> play<00:04:22.180> with<00:04:22.389> it<00:04:22.539> this<00:04:22.690> year

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
you can you can play with it this year

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.100 
you can you can play with it this year
you<00:04:23.020> might<00:04:23.169> want<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:23.380> try<00:04:23.530> making<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.190> dense

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
you might want to try making it a dense

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.680 
you might want to try making it a dense
bush<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:26.410> then<00:04:26.560> say<00:04:27.070> you<00:04:27.130> want<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.690> turn

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
bush but then say you want it to turn

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.659 
bush but then say you want it to turn
into<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:29.080> vine<00:04:29.349> later<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.639> a

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
into a vine later on that is a

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.529 
into a vine later on that is a
possibility

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
possibility

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.920 
possibility
I've<00:04:32.259> got<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.560> little<00:04:33.389> sucker<00:04:34.389> that's<00:04:34.630> growing

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
I've got a little sucker that's growing

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.930 
I've got a little sucker that's growing
off<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.169> side<00:04:35.380> here<00:04:35.770> I'm<00:04:36.190> going<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.370> trim<00:04:36.910> that

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
off the side here I'm going to trim that

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.270 
off the side here I'm going to trim that
off<00:04:37.150> as<00:04:37.509> well<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:39.060> don't<00:04:40.060> want<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:41.039> growth<00:04:42.039> to

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
off as well I don't want the growth to

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.810 
off as well I don't want the growth to
be<00:04:43.800> distracted<00:04:44.800> from<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.160> top<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.580> plant

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
be distracted from the top of the plant

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.080 
be distracted from the top of the plant
so<00:04:46.599> I<00:04:46.990> could<00:04:47.889> try<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.250> route<00:04:48.699> some<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.000> these

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
so I could try to route some of these

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.900 
so I could try to route some of these
cuttings<00:04:49.479> but<00:04:49.889> routing<00:04:50.889> bougainvillea<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.880> a

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
cuttings but routing bougainvillea is a

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.020 
cuttings but routing bougainvillea is a
very<00:04:52.270> difficult<00:04:52.479> process<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:54.639> success

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
very difficult process and the success

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.850 
very difficult process and the success
rate<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:55.389> very<00:04:55.449> low<00:04:55.660> so<00:04:56.349> I'm<00:04:56.440> not<00:04:56.530> even<00:04:56.590> going

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
rate is very low so I'm not even going

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.350 
rate is very low so I'm not even going
to<00:04:56.949> waste<00:04:57.070> my<00:04:57.220> time<00:04:57.340> with<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.880> at<00:04:57.970> this<00:04:58.120> point

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
to waste my time with it at this point

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.899 
to waste my time with it at this point
maybe<00:04:58.930> in<00:04:59.050> time<00:04:59.320> I'll<00:04:59.590> do<00:05:00.009> a<00:05:00.039> fun<00:05:00.280> project<00:05:00.520> but

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
maybe in time I'll do a fun project but

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.700 
maybe in time I'll do a fun project but
right<00:05:01.060> now<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.240> have<00:05:01.389> a<00:05:01.570> lot<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.810> other<00:05:02.320> stuff

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
right now I have a lot of other stuff

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.810 
right now I have a lot of other stuff
downstairs<00:05:02.949> and<00:05:03.460> for<00:05:04.180> something<00:05:04.479> that<00:05:04.750> is<00:05:04.930> a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
downstairs and for something that is a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.240 
downstairs and for something that is a
50%<00:05:06.820> or<00:05:07.330> less<00:05:07.409> success<00:05:08.409> rate<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.860> don't<00:05:09.159> even

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
50% or less success rate I don't even

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.240 
50% or less success rate I don't even
want<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.580> waste<00:05:09.729> my<00:05:09.880> time<00:05:09.909> at<00:05:10.270> this<00:05:10.389> moment<00:05:11.250> so

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
want to waste my time at this moment so

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.219 
want to waste my time at this moment so
I'll<00:05:13.060> bring<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.389> little<00:05:13.509> bit<00:05:13.630> closer<00:05:13.900> we'll

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
I'll bring a little bit closer we'll

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.070 
I'll bring a little bit closer we'll
look<00:05:14.320> at<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:16.120> prune<00:05:16.360> job<00:05:16.659> and<00:05:16.900> where<00:05:17.050> I

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
look at the the prune job and where I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.600 
look at the the prune job and where I
took<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.530> cuts<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:18.210> yeah<00:05:20.099> okay<00:05:21.099> as<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.580> can

see<00:05:21.759> we've<00:05:22.300> got<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.990> cut<00:05:23.349> here<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:23.919> there's<00:05:24.400> a

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
see we've got a cut here and there's a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.450 
see we've got a cut here and there's a
leaf<00:05:24.669> node<00:05:24.699> right<00:05:25.500> right<00:05:26.500> here<00:05:26.889> so<00:05:27.099> you<00:05:27.159> want

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
leaf node right right here so you want

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.790 
leaf node right right here so you want
to<00:05:27.520> cut<00:05:27.699> just<00:05:27.729> just<00:05:28.509> above<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.050> leaf<00:05:29.289> node<00:05:29.560> as

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
to cut just just above the leaf node as

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.129 
to cut just just above the leaf node as
you<00:05:30.520> can<00:05:30.610> see<00:05:30.789> here's<00:05:31.090> another<00:05:31.360> cut<00:05:31.630> here<00:05:32.020> I've

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
you can see here's another cut here I've

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.149 
you can see here's another cut here I've
got<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.830> leaf<00:05:33.039> right<00:05:33.449> right<00:05:34.449> there<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.830> same

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
got the leaf right right there and same

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.580 
got the leaf right right there and same
thing<00:05:36.190> with<00:05:36.430> right<00:05:36.759> here<00:05:37.169> we've<00:05:38.169> got<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.349> leaf

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
thing with right here we've got a leaf

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.950 
thing with right here we've got a leaf
node<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:39.159> then<00:05:39.969> that's<00:05:40.150> where<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.330> made<00:05:40.539> my<00:05:40.690> cut

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
node and then that's where I made my cut

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.589 
node and then that's where I made my cut
you<00:05:41.710> want<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.979> make<00:05:42.099> it<00:05:42.280> as<00:05:42.849> close<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.240> leaf

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
you want to make it as close to leaf

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.249 
you want to make it as close to leaf
node<00:05:43.870> as<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.320> can<00:05:44.909> this<00:05:45.909> will<00:05:46.210> in<00:05:46.599> in<00:05:47.020> time

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
node as you can this will in in time

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.649 
node as you can this will in in time
hide<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.009> cut<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.969> won't<00:05:49.180> even<00:05:49.270> notice<00:05:49.509> that

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
hide the cut you won't even notice that

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.040 
hide the cut you won't even notice that
I<00:05:49.840> pruned<00:05:50.500> it<00:05:50.620> at<00:05:50.740> that<00:05:50.889> point<00:05:51.130> in<00:05:51.940> time<00:05:52.270> right

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
I pruned it at that point in time right

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.560 
I pruned it at that point in time right
now<00:05:53.229> it's<00:05:53.469> the<00:05:53.560> first<00:05:53.710> thing<00:05:53.919> you<00:05:54.009> see<00:05:54.190> but

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
now it's the first thing you see but

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.839 
now it's the first thing you see but
yeah<00:05:55.570> in<00:05:56.020> time<00:05:56.349> this<00:05:56.650> will<00:05:56.860> grow<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.610> be<00:05:57.820> a

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
yeah in time this will grow to be a

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.810 
yeah in time this will grow to be a
beautiful<00:05:58.330> specimen<00:05:58.599> yet<00:05:59.229> again<00:05:59.610> with<00:06:00.610> many

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
beautiful specimen yet again with many

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.459 
beautiful specimen yet again with many
many<00:06:01.030> prunings<00:06:01.509> this<00:06:01.719> will<00:06:01.930> turn<00:06:02.229> into<00:06:02.380> a

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
many prunings this will turn into a

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.820 
many prunings this will turn into a
really<00:06:02.740> nice<00:06:02.949> dense<00:06:03.870> ball<00:06:04.870> of<00:06:04.900> beautiful
