00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.310
 video on the shadows so this is a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.099
 quite technical topic is quite extensive 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 so not very fun but hey it's try 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.210
 to take examples that we use 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.500
 all the time has the face the body and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.360
 so we'll see how 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.690
 to untangle it all here it's gone 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.350
 to your pencils then we will start with 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.529
 a character a character comic 1 and we 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.769
 will see how easily we can 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.939
 to finally place her shadows and so 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.980
 give volume to what the shadows 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.120
 that's it so first of all it takes 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.829
 define a light form this is to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.290
 to tell where does one come from 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 rays of sunlight 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 the lamp no matter the source of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 light and not change air that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 here we have selected the top left will 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.399
 maybe place in the top right but 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 you have to define one and stick to it 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.920
 so here in this case we will see 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 the inside finally the hollow of the ear 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 that it will be a little in the shade 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:05.100
 we are going to have the underside of the nose we will see 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:10.890
 the part in his chin hop the third of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.500
 face here to my little advice it's 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.369
 like the reviews for the hair when we 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 start to make the shadows it's worth 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.950
 better stay rather sober missing mm 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.600
 not everywhere and that it's effective from 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 want to put a little bit everywhere 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 do not look pretty and you'll see 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.770
 that by staying very very simple in the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 flat without need of place 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.390
 massa are walking very well 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.189
 so there the sweater so there the more seen that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.619
 the rays come or from above we go 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 obviously have the bottom part that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.170
 will be in the shadow while thinking well 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.049
 the folding we must know 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.820
 where they go to yvon has varied 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.009
 is going to be hollow and what a place it 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 is going to be seven a salient 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.640
 what's going to make it all wrong? 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.869
 take the light put so here we go 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.869
 have a party in the shadows behind 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.860
 here we will see the shadow of the little cord 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.210
 I 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.739
 hair obviously so hair 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.790
 we will take part in a little color 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.790
 darker 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.440
 always think carefully in terms of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.370
 volume or is there any hollow or 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 are there any bones that form and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:52.350
 spring etc 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.490
 it's important here so I'm going 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.220
 you take it off and give it back to you 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.520
 go see pretty much the change so 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.380
 Here was flat colors that is 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.540
 to say that the colors are united and there 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.100
 with the shadows will bring a small 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.280
 little volume so it's still a 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.390
 little bit better we will try to do 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.850
 this on jean now here it is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.390
 then same principle we define source of 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.560
 light and we will come to place our 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.650
 shadows for jeans it's the same 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.860
 must take into account 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:34.709
 the folds and we will come shade and all 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:41.360
 the part that is opposed to another 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:44.690
 light source that's it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.310
 you have better stay we can 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.430
 stay sober especially in a style in 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.500
 done I did not say but in a style 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.270
 cartoon or comics even manga it's not the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.960
 trouble of one is not in realism 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:06.650
 so we could very well stay 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:10.040
 really very very relieved placed on 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.690
 our our arm by taking good in 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.690
 count the folds as always 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.090
 ah yes we must distinguish two types 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.419
 dhombres that I did not want said it's 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.500
 important there is the clean shadow 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.130
 that is to say, the number that will be 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.320
 formed by the volume of your from 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.810
 your shirt your sweaters etc 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.580
 and the shadow is carried forward 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.530
 so I do it the sonatt man 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.930
 it's the shadow that will create your 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.490
 character or other elements on a 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.840
 other surface 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.830
 there are really two types of darkness there that 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.770
 convoy us it's really numerous 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.440
 own except speak for example if I do 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.720
 the shadow of the collar here it will be the shadow 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.860
 collar range so that's it 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.990
 to know these little things of the little ones 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.740
 details 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.140
 unfortunately I will not be able to 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.300
 addressed in a single video 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.120
 otherwise we would have for a long time and you 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.800
 have stalled so here you have seen 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.450
 that just master in small 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.850
 keys and that's enough it gives a little 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.750
 little volume here we have something 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.510
 of dish 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.669
 here's a little volume here and we're going 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.100
 finish with then for everyone 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:18.050
 either world be happy I made you 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:21.950
 a little manga face that's it and we're going 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.210
 see that it's the same principle we're going 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.210
 see our shadow 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:37.170
 replace the different fine elements 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:43.350
 number in the hollows below chin 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.350
 behind the neck collarbone 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.580
 we will see all this part a little 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.990
 in the shadows throughout the entire 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.390
 lajoux who is not exposed to 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.980
 light salutes that really makes it attractive 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.860
 I advise you to work 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.900
 whole rather than in half we're going 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.270
 to say that allows to have something that is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.730
 not symmetrical and it's a lot more 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.580
 nice actually actually played that the 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.690
 dissymmetry that's important again 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.210
 what's going on in the hair 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.230
 is that when they are exposed to the 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.990
 light in any case for the hair 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.610
 well brilliant we did a part this 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.210
 part there there that is like going 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.340
 projections 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.920
 it takes light well and suddenly we 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:26.030
 we really have a beautiful play of light 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.780
 so the cost that is also in 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.930
 the shadow to see this part there in 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.930
 The shadow 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:40.400
 the folds forget years if you know not 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.870
 how to make folds where to invite 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.280
 to see them at the video folds that you 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.970
 will allow a little more to understand 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.970
 how it works 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.670
 so here are the eyes so what are we going 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.670
 make 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.630
 surveyor that we'll put it in tram that 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.030
 will be much prettier tac 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.050
 so I had the rendering I find it 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.630
 really nice it's really good 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.680
 long with a little bit of tram and so 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.210
 here we have a character who is well 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.060
 number and if I remove it I do not put 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:12.380
 so we were all white at first 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:15.110
 alas in grayed out good voila voila for the 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.570
 shadows I hope I have addressed this 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.490
 thing to get you out with the drawing 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.350
 of the daily drawing if it is not the 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.470
 case do not hesitate to tell me more 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:27.710
 shows of things to have one says oneself to 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:30.950
 Saturday for I do not know what theme 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.520
 I 'll see that by then 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.520
 go ahead
