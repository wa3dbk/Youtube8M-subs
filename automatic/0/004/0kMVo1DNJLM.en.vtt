was very close to kind you see well at

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.430 
was very close to kind you see well at
the<00:01:35.890> moment<00:01:36.039> I'm<00:01:36.369> level<00:01:36.729> two<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.960> really

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
the moment I'm level two it is a really

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.690 
the moment I'm level two it is a really
low<00:01:38.710> level<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.460> would<00:01:39.880> suggest<00:01:40.030> going<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
low level I would suggest going to it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700 
low level I would suggest going to it
suggests<00:01:43.210> back<00:01:43.479> talking<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:45.960> earlier<00:01:46.960> area

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
suggests back talking to earlier area

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.059 
suggests back talking to earlier area
and<00:01:47.950> there's<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:49.080> merman<00:01:50.080> place<00:01:50.649> where

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
and there's like a merman place where

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.940 
and there's like a merman place where
you<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.340> do<00:01:51.789> all<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.030> them<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:53.409> reason<00:01:53.740> why<00:01:53.920> I

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
you can do all of them the reason why I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.389 
you can do all of them the reason why I
didn't<00:01:54.369> call<00:01:54.399> days<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:55.060> rush<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.740> that's<00:01:57.039> a

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
didn't call days to rush and that's a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.660 
didn't call days to rush and that's a
