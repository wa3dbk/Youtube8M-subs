the past
the<00:00:48.030> mother<00:00:48.239> effort<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:49.110> damaged<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the mother effort was very damaged that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.670 
the mother effort was very damaged that
we<00:00:49.950> needed<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> work<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.020> rebuilding<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.230> and

body in the laboratory to determine

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.670

which<00:02:21.519> would<00:02:21.700> be<00:02:21.849> most<00:02:22.060> effective<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:22.930> my<00:02:23.170> kind

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.940 
of cancer so again I was not exposed
today<00:02:27.129> so<00:02:27.310> why<00:02:27.700> would<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.030> choose<00:02:28.269> sodomy

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
today so why would I choose sodomy

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.910 
today so why would I choose sodomy
because<00:02:29.970> they<00:02:30.970> treat<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.510> individual<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.620> of

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
because they treat the individual and of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.960 
because they treat the individual and of
the<00:02:33.099> disease

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the disease

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.319 
the disease
why<00:02:34.709> would<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.739> recommend<00:02:36.190> sodomy<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:37.030> others

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
why would I recommend sodomy to others

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.920 
why would I recommend sodomy to others
that<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.780> would<00:02:38.079> say<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.970> I've<00:02:39.970> had<00:02:40.360> such<00:02:40.690> a
