00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.929
 3 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.670
 the cable corresponding to the butterfly body is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.820
 analyzed 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 connect the connector corresponding to the butterfly body in this way 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.270
 connect then 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.270
 another with reading the bob that way 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.430
 connect the claws to a 12 volt battery or source with a minimum current 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 from 5 to paris this way 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.680
 make sure all bob leads light up c 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.390
 wait 10 seconds for automatic identification of the butterfly body. 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 Light tracks turn on 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.350
 If you want to injure your human body, check the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 equipment and is injured through this technique afp 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.270
 4 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.739
 in the manual test select the track of the body to be analyzed in this way 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.179
 W 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.620
 note that accordingly you select track 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.830
 the butterfly body opens or closes 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 not 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.639
 bush 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:38.829
 after selecting the track increase the voltage by pressing this key 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.249
 8 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.229
 or decrease voltage by pressing this key 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.659
 to change the track at any time press the track select key 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:33.369
 observe according to what increases the voltage decreases the body opens or 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.369
 it closes 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.069
 yea 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.340
 tighten this technique to start automatic body test 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.189
 the lead and green lights up 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.529
 wait until the end of the test that will have the approximate time of three 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.529
 minutes 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.790
 check that is the body will open and close slowly by alternating the tracks 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 freyre 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.139
 after the automatic test of people 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.229
 a contour test will be done by opening and closing the butterfly quickly 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.229
 so the green lead goes out 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.900
 without any of the tests hurt or automatic lead and failure 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.030
 lighting means that there was an anomaly in the body
