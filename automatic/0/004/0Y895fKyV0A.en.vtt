don't have empty nice spaces we're going

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.550 
don't have empty nice spaces we're going

we're<00:02:10.290> going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> build<00:02:10.800> up<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.220> seed<00:02:11.700> supply<00:02:12.150> in

we're going to build up a seed supply in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.690 
we're going to build up a seed supply in
the<00:02:12.750> soil<00:02:13.080> we're<00:02:13.740> going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> let<00:02:14.130> some<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.610> the

the soil we're going to let some of the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.290 
the soil we're going to let some of the
plants<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> seed<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.320> there's<00:02:16.710> always

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
plants go to seed so there's always

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.780 
plants go to seed so there's always

thousands of seeds lying dormant in the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.030 
thousands of seeds lying dormant in the
soil<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.690> you'll<00:02:21.870> remove<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.440> plan<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
soil so if you'll remove a plan and you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.760 
soil so if you'll remove a plan and you
do<00:02:23.310> create<00:02:23.610> an<00:02:23.790> empty<00:02:24.090> space<00:02:24.770> there's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
do create an empty space there's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.090 
do create an empty space there's
something<00:02:26.190> good<00:02:26.490> need<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.240> fill<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> gap

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
something good need to fill the gap

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.380 
something good need to fill the gap
something<00:02:29.100> good<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.580> fill<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.000> emptiness

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
something good to fill that emptiness

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.510 
something good to fill that emptiness
face<00:02:30.840> because<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> don't<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.490> something

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
face because if you don't have something

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.890 
face because if you don't have something
good<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.660> weeds<00:02:34.650> will<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.160> you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
good there then weeds will do it for you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
capacity and that is its producing a lot

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.010 
capacity and that is its producing a lot
more<00:02:46.640> now<00:02:47.640> because<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.240> producing<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.870> lot

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
more now because it's producing a lot

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.840 
more now because it's producing a lot
more<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.920> put<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.220> little<00:02:50.370> bit<00:02:50.580> into

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
more you have to put a little bit into

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.240 
more you have to put a little bit into

compost<00:02:56.400> what<00:02:57.060> we're<00:02:57.239> going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.420> try<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:58.019> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
compost what we're going to try to do is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.949 
compost what we're going to try to do is
set<00:02:58.769> up<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.980> system<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.360> when<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.750> bring

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
set up a system so that when you bring

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.259 
set up a system so that when you bring
nutrients<00:03:01.500> into<00:03:01.830> your<00:03:01.950> life<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.790> keep<00:03:03.090> them

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
nutrients into your life you keep them

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.960 
nutrients into your life you keep them
in<00:03:03.510> your<00:03:03.780> system<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:05.430> put<00:03:05.700> them<00:03:05.820> into

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
in your system and you put them into

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.670 
in your system and you put them into
your<00:03:06.090> garden<00:03:06.300> through<00:03:06.870> your<00:03:07.080> composting

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
your garden through your composting

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.970 
your garden through your composting
system<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.420> eat<00:03:09.630> them<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:10.410> EP<00:03:10.800> our

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
comments so you're getting a nice

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.950 
comments so you're getting a nice
nutrient<00:03:16.260> flow<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.250> cycling

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
nutrient flow and I cycling

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.050 
nutrient flow and I cycling
now<00:03:19.960> we're<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> traditional<00:03:20.890> garden<00:03:21.310> what<00:03:22.030> I

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
now we're the traditional garden what I

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.510 
now we're the traditional garden what I
want<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.840> find<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.440> when<00:03:23.470> these<00:03:23.950> empty<00:03:24.310> nice

want to find is when these empty nice

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.240 
want to find is when these empty nice
faces<00:03:24.880> get<00:03:25.570> filled<00:03:25.900> with<00:03:26.080> weeds<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.830> first

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
faces get filled with weeds the first

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.340 
faces get filled with weeds the first
thing<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.670> traditional<00:03:28.240> gardener<00:03:28.690> does<00:03:28.870> is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
thing the traditional gardener does is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.430 
thing the traditional gardener does is
deep<00:03:29.710> those<00:03:29.950> weeds<00:03:30.250> over<00:03:31.020> now<00:03:32.020> there's<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.260> few

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
deep those weeds over now there's a few

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.110 
deep those weeds over now there's a few
problems<00:03:32.590> with<00:03:33.010> doing<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.430> what<00:03:33.880> they're

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
problems with doing that what they're

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.380 
problems with doing that what they're
doing<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.630> they're<00:03:34.930> taking<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.400> dry<00:03:36.700> crusty

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.660 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty
structureless<00:03:37.960> soil<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.950> lying<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.580> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
structureless soil that's lying on the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.370 
structureless soil that's lying on the
top<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.150> they're<00:03:40.570> turning<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.020> over<00:03:41.110> and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
top and they're turning it over and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.530 
top and they're turning it over and
putting<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.710> underneath<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:43.240> soil

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
putting it underneath and that soil

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.750 
putting it underneath and that soil
underneath<00:03:43.840> has<00:03:44.140> got<00:03:44.380> good<00:03:44.620> structure<00:03:45.310> but

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
underneath has got good structure but

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.340 
underneath has got good structure but
now<00:03:45.940> you're<00:03:46.060> put<00:03:46.240> it<00:03:46.360> on<00:03:46.480> top<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.990> it's<00:03:47.140> going

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
now you're put it on top and it's going

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.020 
now you're put it on top and it's going
to<00:03:47.410> dry<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.070> it's<00:03:48.220> gonna<00:03:48.400> lose<00:03:48.700> its

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
to dry out and it's gonna lose its

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.980 
to dry out and it's gonna lose its
structure<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.830> problem<00:03:51.400> was<00:03:51.610> weeds<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:52.720> now

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
structure the problem was weeds but now

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.590 
structure the problem was weeds but now
you've<00:03:53.410> created<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.950> new<00:03:54.160> problem<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:55.180> created

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
you've created a new problem we created

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.660 
you've created a new problem we created
the<00:03:55.690> problem<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:56.170> having<00:03:56.380> structureless<00:03:57.100> soil

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
the problem of having structureless soil

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.030 
the problem of having structureless soil
now<00:03:58.360> structureless<00:03:58.900> soil<00:03:59.380> has<00:03:59.620> its<00:03:59.860> own

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
now structureless soil has its own

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.910 
now structureless soil has its own
problems<00:04:00.510> firstly<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.600> can't<00:04:01.900> hold<00:04:02.200> water<00:04:02.290> as

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
problems firstly it can't hold water as

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.790 
problems firstly it can't hold water as
well<00:04:03.489> as<00:04:03.760> good<00:04:04.360> structured<00:04:04.930> soil<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.709> you're

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
well as good structured soil so you're

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.380 
well as good structured soil so you're
going<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:05.950> have<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.160> put<00:04:06.310> more<00:04:06.489> water<00:04:06.790> into

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
going to have to put more water into

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.960 
going to have to put more water into
your<00:04:07.630> garden<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.010> other<00:04:09.370> problem<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
your garden now the other problem that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.449 
your garden now the other problem that
causes<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.380> can't<00:04:11.680> pass<00:04:11.980> on<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
causes is you can't pass on the

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.550 
causes is you can't pass on the
nutrients<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.209> plans<00:04:13.570> as<00:04:14.250> effectively<00:04:16.560> so

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
nutrients to the plans as effectively so

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.590 
nutrients to the plans as effectively so
we<00:04:17.709> started<00:04:18.160> out<00:04:18.310> with<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.489> weed<00:04:18.790> problem<00:04:19.269> and

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
we started out with a weed problem and

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.350 
we started out with a weed problem and
now<00:04:19.840> we've<00:04:20.049> got<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> problem<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:21.010> soil<00:04:21.880> that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
now we've got the problem of soil that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.110 
now we've got the problem of soil that
doesn't<00:04:22.720> hold<00:04:22.870> water<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.669> we've<00:04:24.669> also<00:04:24.850> got

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
doesn't hold water and we've also got

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.450 
doesn't hold water and we've also got
the<00:04:25.210> problem<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.780> soil<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.560> doesn't<00:04:26.919> pass<00:04:27.250> on

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the problem of soil that doesn't pass on

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.210 
the problem of soil that doesn't pass on
its<00:04:27.610> nutrients<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.600> now<00:04:28.780> we<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.140> add

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
its nutrients so now we have to add

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.400 
its nutrients so now we have to add
inorganic<00:04:30.220> fertilizers<00:04:31.120> now<00:04:31.930> when<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.169> do

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
inorganic fertilizers now when you do

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.440 
inorganic fertilizers now when you do
that<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:33.040> start<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.400> kill<00:04:33.640> all<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.970> all<00:04:34.390> the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
that you start to kill all the all the

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.840 
that you start to kill all the all the
biological<00:04:35.410> life<00:04:35.650> that's<00:04:35.979> in<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.250> soil<00:04:36.550> and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
biological life that's in the soil and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.909 
biological life that's in the soil and
that<00:04:37.440> biological<00:04:38.440> life<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.800> actually

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
that biological life is actually

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.590 
that biological life is actually
important<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:40.419> actually<00:04:40.930> build<00:04:41.830> structure<00:04:42.600> so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
important to actually build structure so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.060 
important to actually build structure so
you'll<00:04:43.780> end<00:04:43.960> up<00:04:44.080> with<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.290> really<00:04:44.680> good

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
you'll end up with a really good

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.750 
you'll end up with a really good
substance<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.350> with<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.500> method<00:04:47.860> with<00:04:48.610> the

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.849 
fruitful wealth method
the<00:04:50.729> most<00:04:50.939> important<00:04:51.689> thing<00:04:51.719> to<00:04:52.199> remember<00:04:52.349> is

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:52.859 
the most important thing to remember is

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.609 
the most important thing to remember is
look<00:04:53.369> after<00:04:53.819> your<00:04:53.939> soil<00:04:54.319> because<00:04:55.319> it<00:04:55.469> feels

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:55.619 
look after your soil because it feels

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:57.739 
look after your soil because it feels
soil<00:04:56.039> is<00:04:56.309> well<00:04:56.639> looked<00:04:56.879> after<00:04:57.029> it<00:04:57.449> will<00:04:57.569> look

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
soil is well looked after it will look

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.529 
soil is well looked after it will look
after<00:04:57.899> you<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:59.129> the<00:04:59.189> way<00:04:59.339> we<00:04:59.489> look<00:04:59.639> after<00:04:59.849> is

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
after you and the way we look after is

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.649 
after you and the way we look after is
we<00:05:00.779> don't<00:05:01.079> touch<00:05:01.559> it<00:05:02.059> we<00:05:03.059> let<00:05:03.299> it<00:05:03.449> lie

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
we don't touch it we let it lie

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.189 
we don't touch it we let it lie
underneath<00:05:04.849> we<00:05:05.849> don't<00:05:05.999> you<00:05:06.209> dig<00:05:06.509> it<00:05:06.539> we<00:05:06.989> don't

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
underneath we don't you dig it we don't

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.039 
underneath we don't you dig it we don't
turn<00:05:07.499> it<00:05:07.769> we<00:05:08.309> want<00:05:08.459> to<00:05:08.729> retain<00:05:08.969> that<00:05:09.509> beautiful

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:10.049 
turn it we want to retain that beautiful

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:12.319 
turn it we want to retain that beautiful
structure<00:05:10.439> so<00:05:10.799> it<00:05:10.829> could<00:05:11.009> hold<00:05:11.309> nutrients<00:05:12.089> and

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:12.329 
structure so it could hold nutrients and

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:14.629 
structure so it could hold nutrients and
pass<00:05:12.869> them<00:05:13.079> on<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.259> the<00:05:13.409> plants<00:05:13.829> they<00:05:14.249> can<00:05:14.399> hold

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
pass them on to the plants they can hold

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.099 
pass them on to the plants they can hold
water<00:05:15.859> so<00:05:16.859> that<00:05:17.069> number<00:05:18.029> one<00:05:18.179> rule<00:05:18.479> with<00:05:18.899> this

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:19.109 
water so that number one rule with this

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:23.059 
water so that number one rule with this
method<00:05:19.529> is<00:05:19.799> no<00:05:20.219> digging<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:22.169> only<00:05:22.649> way<00:05:22.829> we

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
method is no digging the only way we

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.489 
method is no digging the only way we
work<00:05:23.339> the<00:05:23.519> soil<00:05:23.759> is<00:05:24.299> we<00:05:24.569> add<00:05:24.749> layers<00:05:25.169> of

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:25.499 
work the soil is we add layers of

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:29.179 
work the soil is we add layers of
compost<00:05:26.129> on<00:05:26.459> the<00:05:26.999> top<00:05:27.209> as<00:05:27.449> a<00:05:27.509> surface<00:05:28.469> mulch<00:05:28.739> on

bare patches covered the same day if
possible<00:05:36.059> I<00:05:36.599> just<00:05:37.229> want<00:05:37.409> to<00:05:37.469> keep<00:05:37.649> that<00:05:37.709> soil

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
possible I just want to keep that soil

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.209 
possible I just want to keep that soil
protected<00:05:39.029> on<00:05:39.779> and<00:05:40.139> keep<00:05:40.379> that<00:05:40.589> structure

protected on and keep that structure

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.419 
protected on and keep that structure
this<00:05:42.119> is<00:05:42.239> a<00:05:42.269> really<00:05:42.959> important<00:05:43.829> part<00:05:44.099> of<00:05:44.279> the

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:44.429 
this is a really important part of the

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:47.749 
this is a really important part of the
process<00:05:45.229> now<00:05:46.229> in<00:05:46.409> the<00:05:46.559> food<00:05:46.799> world<00:05:46.829> method

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
process now in the food world method

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.389 
process now in the food world method
we're<00:05:48.659> not<00:05:48.869> going<00:05:49.049> to<00:05:49.109> plant<00:05:49.439> in<00:05:49.679> rows<00:05:49.979> and

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:50.399 
we're not going to plant in rows and

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:52.999 
we're not going to plant in rows and
we're<00:05:50.699> not<00:05:50.819> going<00:05:50.969> to<00:05:51.059> plan<00:05:51.299> one<00:05:51.929> single<00:05:52.739> type

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
we're not going to plan one single type

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.369 
we're not going to plan one single type
of<00:05:53.219> a<00:05:53.249> plan<00:05:53.579> to<00:05:54.059> an<00:05:54.149> area<00:05:54.360> we're<00:05:55.139> going<00:05:55.289> to

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
of a plan to an area we're going to

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.979 
of a plan to an area we're going to
mostly<00:05:56.069> just<00:05:56.279> mix<00:05:56.699> everything<00:05:56.969> up<00:05:57.449> there's<00:05:57.899> a

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:57.989 
mostly just mix everything up there's a

00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:00.679 
mostly just mix everything up there's a
good<00:05:58.169> reason<00:05:58.409> for<00:05:58.649> doing<00:05:58.860> this<00:05:59.039> firstly<00:05:59.969> it

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
good reason for doing this firstly it

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.519 
good reason for doing this firstly it
gives<00:06:00.989> you<00:06:01.110> much<00:06:01.439> better<00:06:01.799> pest<00:06:02.549> protection

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:03.529 
gives you much better pest protection

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.909 
gives you much better pest protection
now<00:06:04.669> pests<00:06:05.669> who<00:06:05.939> eat<00:06:06.119> your<00:06:06.509> cross<00:06:06.919> usually

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
now pests who eat your cross usually

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.869 
now pests who eat your cross usually
identify<00:06:08.549> them<00:06:08.849> by<00:06:09.029> sight<00:06:09.719> or<00:06:09.749> smell<00:06:10.639> now<00:06:11.639> when

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
identify them by sight or smell now when

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.669 
identify them by sight or smell now when
you've<00:06:11.999> got<00:06:12.179> everything<00:06:12.449> mixed<00:06:12.839> up<00:06:13.169> it<00:06:13.439> is

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:13.679 
you've got everything mixed up it is

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.209 
you've got everything mixed up it is
very<00:06:14.069> hard<00:06:14.519> for<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:15.029> pests<00:06:15.419> to<00:06:16.079> actually<00:06:16.739> see

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
very hard for the pests to actually see

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.779 
very hard for the pests to actually see
the<00:06:18.029> specific<00:06:18.659> plan<00:06:19.019> that<00:06:19.289> they<00:06:19.439> like<00:06:19.709> it<00:06:20.489> just

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
the specific plan that they like it just

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.620 
the specific plan that they like it just
looks<00:06:20.999> like<00:06:21.089> a<00:06:21.209> jumbled<00:06:21.989> mess

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
looks like a jumbled mess

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.140 
looks like a jumbled mess
and<00:06:22.960> it's<00:06:23.560> impossible<00:06:24.220> for<00:06:24.250> them<00:06:24.400> to<00:06:24.490> smell<00:06:24.970> it

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
and it's impossible for them to smell it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.510 
and it's impossible for them to smell it
because<00:06:26.110> there's<00:06:26.500> too<00:06:26.800> many<00:06:26.950> different

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
because there's too many different

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.140 
because there's too many different
conflicting<00:06:27.880> smells<00:06:29.610> but<00:06:30.610> I<00:06:30.760> have<00:06:30.880> done<00:06:31.090> all

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
conflicting smells but I have done all

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.330 
conflicting smells but I have done all
the<00:06:31.690> hard<00:06:31.870> work<00:06:32.140> so<00:06:32.440> that<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.770> don't<00:06:32.980> have<00:06:33.040> to

the hard work so that you don't have to

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.910 
the hard work so that you don't have to
look<00:06:34.120> just<00:06:34.750> read<00:06:35.110> through<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.650> step-by-step
