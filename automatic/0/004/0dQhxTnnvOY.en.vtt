00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
of muscle activation you can just bring

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.960 
of muscle activation you can just bring
it<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.319> take<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:25.980> out<00:03:26.280> one<00:03:26.579> more<00:03:26.609> time

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.100

activation<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.790> that's<00:04:11.090> what<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:11.870> going<00:04:12.020> to

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
activation and that's what is going to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.860 
activation and that's what is going to
type<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.680> tone<00:04:12.950> especially<00:04:13.520> as<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.480> can<00:04:14.690> learn
