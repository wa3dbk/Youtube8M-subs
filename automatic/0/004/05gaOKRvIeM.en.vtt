recycling no plastic it seems like it's
in<00:00:13.440> every<00:00:13.679> walk<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> our<00:00:14.250> business<00:00:14.639> anymore

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
in every walk of our business anymore

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.480 
in every walk of our business anymore
simple<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> water<00:00:16.470> bottle<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.310> don't

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
simple as a water bottle you don't

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
simple as a water bottle you don't
realize<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.119> used<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.390> think<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
realize that we used to think that the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.870 
realize that we used to think that the
labels<00:00:19.740> were<00:00:19.890> paper<00:00:20.160> they're<00:00:20.430> even<00:00:20.640> plastic

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
labels were paper they're even plastic

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.540 
labels were paper they're even plastic
now<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.830> many<00:00:23.070> other<00:00:23.279> companies

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
now what we do like many other companies

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
now what we do like many other companies
we've<00:00:24.029> learned<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.930> methods<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
we've learned a way and methods to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.400 
we've learned a way and methods to
totally<00:00:26.099> recycle<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> plastic<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:28.230> know

and you know you don't realize you see
how<00:00:34.800> much<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.280> oil<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.149> ocean<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
how much that oil is of that ocean and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.750 
how much that oil is of that ocean and
that<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> were<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.170> horrified<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> and

that you were all horrified on it and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.040 
that you were all horrified on it and
you<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:38.969> that's<00:00:39.180> that's<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> tough

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you know that's that's just a tough

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
you know that's that's just a tough
situation<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> pull<00:00:41.280> together<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.700> try

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
situation we got to pull together to try

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
situation we got to pull together to try
and<00:00:42.030> help<00:00:42.210> solve<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.780> China<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:44.219> throw<00:00:44.520> away

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and help solve in China they throw away

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
and help solve in China they throw away
bottles<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> ocean<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.379> what

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
bottles like this in the ocean and what

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
bottles like this in the ocean and what
they've<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.309> discovered<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.210> think<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
they've now discovered I think it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
they've now discovered I think it's
about<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> size<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.469> Texas<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:50.190> how<00:00:50.520> much

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
about the size of Texas is how much

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
about the size of Texas is how much
plastic<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.510> floating<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.440> why

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
plastic they got floating that's why

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
plastic they got floating that's why
recycling<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.699> critical<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> us<00:00:54.570> we're

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
recycling is so critical to us we're

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.049 
recycling is so critical to us we're
going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> show<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> today<00:00:55.890> how<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.610> do

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
going to show you today how we do

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.450 
going to show you today how we do
recycling<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.170> give<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> better<00:00:58.680> feel<00:00:59.070> what

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
recycling to give you a better feel what

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
recycling to give you a better feel what
can<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.910> done<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
can be done we think there's a way that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.709 
can be done we think there's a way that
we<00:01:01.739> could<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.219> even<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.609> crisis<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> gulf

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we could take even a crisis in the gulf

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.800 
we could take even a crisis in the gulf
and<00:01:03.989> convert<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.979> into<00:01:05.309> something<00:01:05.760> good<00:01:06.180> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and convert that into something good so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.480 
and convert that into something good so
let's<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> planets<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> little

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
let's go through the planets a little

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429 
let's go through the planets a little
loud<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.600> you'll<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.900> adjust<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
loud but I think you'll get adjust of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
loud but I think you'll get adjust of
what<00:01:10.560> we're<00:01:10.680> trying<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.100> Thanks<00:01:11.700> okay<00:01:12.420> this

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
what we're trying to do Thanks okay this

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.420 
what we're trying to do Thanks okay this
is<00:01:12.750> our<00:01:12.869> first<00:01:13.170> stop<00:01:13.439> remember<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> label<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
is our first stop remember the label I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
is our first stop remember the label I
showed<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.000> how<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.229> convert<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
showed you how do we convert that the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
showed you how do we convert that the
first<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.970> put<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
first thing we do is we put it into a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
first thing we do is we put it into a
process<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> mixes<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.759> actually

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
process that mixes it up and it actually

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.870 
process that mixes it up and it actually
is<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> looks<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:23.040> these<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.520> our

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
is it looks like this what these are our

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.289 
is it looks like this what these are our
actual<00:01:24.470> material<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.070> label<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.060> kind

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
actual material of the label that's kind

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
actual material of the label that's kind
of<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.570> scrunched<00:01:28.290> together<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.189> be

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of all scrunched together so it can be

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
of all scrunched together so it can be
movable<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.390> take<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.259> mix<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
movable we then take that and mix it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
movable we then take that and mix it
with<00:01:31.890> other<00:01:32.040> materials<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.170> we

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
with other materials like this and we

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
with other materials like this and we
put<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:34.770> blenders<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
put it in these blenders what the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.660 
put it in these blenders what the
blenders<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.840> mix<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.380> mix<00:01:37.650> together<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
blenders do is mix a mix together that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
blenders do is mix a mix together that
we<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:39.150> compound<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> pellet<00:01:40.560> where

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
we can then compound into a pellet where

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
we can then compound into a pellet where
the<00:01:41.130> pellets<00:01:41.520> used<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.150> molding<00:01:42.600> parts

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the pellets used for is molding parts

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.300 
the pellets used for is molding parts
you're<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> see<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> whole<00:01:44.070> process

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you're going to see that whole process

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
you're going to see that whole process
today<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.540> cool<00:01:45.750> how<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
today it's really kind of cool how this

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
today it's really kind of cool how this
thing<00:01:46.680> works<00:01:46.710> okay<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.899> cool

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
thing works okay this is really a cool

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
thing works okay this is really a cool
process<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:50.070> those<00:01:50.220> materials<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
process all those materials that you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.960 
process all those materials that you
just<00:01:51.270> saw<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.229> mix<00:01:52.470> together<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:53.610> drop

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
just saw that we mix together we drop

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.510 
just saw that we mix together we drop
into<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.570> extruder<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> extruder<00:01:56.490> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
into this extruder all the extruder is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
into this extruder all the extruder is
as<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> way<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> heat<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> heats<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
as a way to heat up so it heats the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.130 
as a way to heat up so it heats the
plastic<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.299> coming<00:02:00.630> through<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> die

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
plastic up and it's coming through a die

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.800 
plastic up and it's coming through a die
as<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.860> comes<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.460> guy<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.299> goes<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
as it comes to that guy it goes down a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
as it comes to that guy it goes down a
water<00:02:04.200> bath<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.430> then<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:05.759> you're<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
water bath and then what you're going to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.139 
water bath and then what you're going to
see<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.840> ahead<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.530> we

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
see is we go ahead and and we

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
see is we go ahead and and we
pehle<00:02:09.360> ties<00:02:09.659> it<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.140> end<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:11.129> right<00:02:11.159> as

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
pehle ties it at the end all right as

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
pehle ties it at the end all right as
you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.879> pelletizing<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.349> doing

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you can see pelletizing what it's doing

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.530 
you can see pelletizing what it's doing
is<00:02:13.709> putting<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.159> material<00:02:14.760> into<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.329> little

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
is putting this material into a little

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.880 
is putting this material into a little
pellet<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.439> they<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.799> then<00:02:16.980> mold<00:02:17.280> with<00:02:18.890> okay

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
pellet that they can then mold with okay

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.979 
pellet that they can then mold with okay
so<00:02:19.950> remember<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.819> label<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.269> took<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.629> label

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
so remember the label we took the label

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.289 
so remember the label we took the label
we<00:02:22.349> weep<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.890> term<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.250> called<00:02:23.400> densify<00:02:24.030> where

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
we weep the term is called densify where

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.330 
we weep the term is called densify where
you<00:02:24.390> scrunch<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.049> from<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:25.980> put<00:02:26.189> it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you scrunch it up from there we put it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.130 
you scrunch it up from there we put it
through<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.670> mixing<00:02:27.180> unit<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.750> then

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
through that mixing unit and then

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.050 
through that mixing unit and then
dropped<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.769> an<00:02:28.890> extruder<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.579> heats<00:02:29.849> it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
dropped it in an extruder with heats it

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.179 
dropped it in an extruder with heats it
up<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:30.810> these<00:02:30.989> pellets<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:31.739> here<00:02:32.069> is

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
up and then these pellets right here is

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.160 
up and then these pellets right here is
what<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> motor<00:02:32.939> would<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.390> make<00:02:33.569> parts<00:02:33.989> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
what a motor would do to make parts and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.569 
what a motor would do to make parts and
that'll<00:02:34.379> be<00:02:34.470> our<00:02:34.560> next<00:02:34.739> stop<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.189> show<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.459> how

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
that'll be our next stop to show you how

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.819 
that'll be our next stop to show you how
parts<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.629> actually<00:02:37.049> made<00:02:37.260> using<00:02:37.560> these

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
parts are actually made using these

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.940 
parts are actually made using these
materials<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:39.030> really<00:02:39.390> much<00:02:39.629> like<00:02:39.989> making<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
materials it's really much like making a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.979 
materials it's really much like making a
cake<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.700> put<00:02:41.909> different<00:02:42.209> materials<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
cake you put different materials in and

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.039 
cake you put different materials in and
you<00:02:43.079> blend<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.709> heat<00:02:43.889> it<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:45.049> okay

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
you blend it then you heat it up okay

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.960 
you blend it then you heat it up okay
there's<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.409> green<00:02:46.980> pellet<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.639> saw<00:02:47.849> it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
there's a green pellet that you saw it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.930 
there's a green pellet that you saw it
the<00:02:48.090> other<00:02:48.120> plant<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:49.049> just<00:02:49.260> molded<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.940> 30

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
the other plant we just molded a 30

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.059 
the other plant we just molded a 30
gallon<00:02:51.180> container<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.560> getting<00:02:52.769> picked

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
gallon container and it's getting picked

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.520 
gallon container and it's getting picked
up<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.459> dropped<00:02:53.519> out<00:02:53.849> of<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:55.200> way<00:02:55.379> this

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
up and dropped out of there the way this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.349 
up and dropped out of there the way this
machine<00:02:55.950> works<00:02:56.159> as<00:02:56.340> an<00:02:56.549> injection<00:02:57.000> molding

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
machine works as an injection molding

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.360 
machine works as an injection molding
machine<00:02:57.750> basically<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.769> dropping<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
machine basically you're dropping the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.149 
machine basically you're dropping the
pellets<00:03:00.090> which<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.450> call<00:03:00.720> into<00:03:01.470> an<00:03:01.590> extruder

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
pellets which we call into an extruder

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.740 
pellets which we call into an extruder
in<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:02.760> sense<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:03.239> heating<00:03:03.510> them<00:03:03.629> up

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
in a sense it's heating them up

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.319 
in a sense it's heating them up
reciprocating<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.829> shooting<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.730> material

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
reciprocating and shooting that material

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.199 
reciprocating and shooting that material
into<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.170> mold<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.549> mold<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.030> then

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
into this mold and that mold is then

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.420 
into this mold and that mold is then
what<00:03:09.420> makes<00:03:09.689> that<00:03:09.930> configuration<00:03:10.620> could<00:03:11.340> be

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
what makes that configuration could be

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.099 
what makes that configuration could be
trash<00:03:11.760> cans<00:03:12.120> could<00:03:12.359> be<00:03:12.450> pallets<00:03:12.870> could<00:03:13.019> be

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
trash cans could be pallets could be

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.080 
trash cans could be pallets could be
anything<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.949> just<00:03:14.099> taking<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.609> plastic

of materials have you've seen all day as
you<00:03:27.150> can<00:03:27.269> see<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> pile<00:03:27.959> heart<00:03:28.500> comes<00:03:28.739> out<00:03:28.980> and

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
you can see the pile heart comes out and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.369 
you can see the pile heart comes out and
then<00:03:29.730> we're<00:03:29.970> within<00:03:30.449> 30<00:03:30.810> seconds<00:03:31.230> we're

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
then we're within 30 seconds we're

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.409 
then we're within 30 seconds we're
making<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.739> next<00:03:31.949> one<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:33.150> you've<00:03:33.299> had

making the next one I think you've had
an<00:03:33.569> opportunity<00:03:33.810> today<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.260> see<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:35.250> recycling

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
an opportunity today to see a recycling

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.080 
an opportunity today to see a recycling
plant<00:03:36.389> how<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.810> operates<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.560> some<00:03:37.769> degree<00:03:38.090> as

we<00:03:39.329> move<00:03:39.659> to<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.930> Gulf<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.620> oil<00:03:40.829> mess

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
we move to the Gulf and the oil mess

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.819 
we move to the Gulf and the oil mess
there<00:03:41.459> here's<00:03:42.239> an<00:03:42.419> idea<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:43.019> we<00:03:43.229> have<00:03:43.590> kind

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
there here's an idea that we have kind

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.339 
there here's an idea that we have kind
of<00:03:43.889> presented<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.909> booms<00:03:45.239> are<00:03:45.690> full<00:03:46.199> of

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
of presented the booms are full of

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.250 
of presented the booms are full of
actually<00:03:46.889> a<00:03:46.919> plastic<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.699> absorb<00:03:48.120> oil<00:03:48.359> but

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
actually a plastic that absorb oil but

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.800 
actually a plastic that absorb oil but
they<00:03:49.379> don't<00:03:49.560> absorb<00:03:49.829> water<00:03:50.129> those<00:03:51.090> same<00:03:51.479> booms

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
they don't absorb water those same booms

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.869 
they don't absorb water those same booms
are<00:03:52.109> full<00:03:52.349> of<00:03:52.470> oil<00:03:52.680> what<00:03:53.099> we<00:03:53.310> want<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.609> do<00:03:53.729> is

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.800 
the oil out give the oil back to BP and
then<00:04:01.859> take<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.340> boom<00:04:02.579> mature<00:04:03.000> oh<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.209> plastic

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
then take the boom mature oh the plastic

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.140 
then take the boom mature oh the plastic
and<00:04:03.989> reprocess<00:04:04.919> it<00:04:04.949> just<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.639> saw<00:04:05.879> today

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
kind of a high-tech company that's the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.409 
kind of a high-tech company that's the
kind<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.530> stuff<00:04:10.739> we<00:04:10.979> do<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.760> really<00:04:12.120> isn't<00:04:12.329> as

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
kind of stuff we do it really isn't as

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.330 
kind of stuff we do it really isn't as
difficult<00:04:12.569> as<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.049> sounds<00:04:13.680> once<00:04:13.919> you've<00:04:14.069> dealt

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
difficult as it sounds once you've dealt

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.159 
difficult as it sounds once you've dealt
with<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.609> as<00:04:14.729> long<00:04:14.849> as<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.419> but<00:04:15.900> i<00:04:15.930> think

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
with it as long as we have but i think

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.769 
with it as long as we have but i think
what<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.409> could<00:04:16.560> do<00:04:16.709> for<00:04:16.739> us<00:04:17.159> is<00:04:17.599> society<00:04:18.599> is

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:18.779 
what it could do for us is society is

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.420 
what it could do for us is society is
you<00:04:18.959> take<00:04:19.200> awful<00:04:20.010> situation<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.849> ryu

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
you take awful situation in ryu

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.189 
you take awful situation in ryu
all<00:04:21.519> those<00:04:21.669> materials<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.419> give<00:04:22.870> them<00:04:22.990> back

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
all those materials and give them back

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.170 
all those materials and give them back
to<00:04:23.229> help<00:04:23.560> fund<00:04:23.770> some<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:24.340> relief<00:04:24.729> so

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
to help fund some of this relief so

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.969 
to help fund some of this relief so
that's<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.600> plan<00:04:25.870> here<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.199> think<00:04:26.350> you've<00:04:26.860> been

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
that's the plan here I think you've been

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.590 
that's the plan here I think you've been
able<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.250> see<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.610> different<00:04:27.910> process<00:04:28.389> that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
able to see the different process that

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.629 
able to see the different process that
we're<00:04:28.780> doing<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.289> how<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.710> can<00:04:29.919> take<00:04:30.190> what

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
we're doing and how you can take what

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.550 
we're doing and how you can take what
doesn't<00:04:31.000> even<00:04:31.240> look<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.479> plastic<00:04:32.229> but

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
doesn't even look like plastic but

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.310 
doesn't even look like plastic but
actual<00:04:32.889> plastic<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.699> to<00:04:34.330> reuse<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.930> again<00:04:35.020> all

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
actual plastic and to reuse it again all

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320 
actual plastic and to reuse it again all
the<00:04:35.590> parts<00:04:35.889> behind<00:04:36.070> me<00:04:36.550> are<00:04:36.759> made<00:04:37.150> out<00:04:37.300> of

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
the parts behind me are made out of

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.529 
the parts behind me are made out of
recycled<00:04:37.570> plastic<00:04:38.500> as<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:39.130> saw<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.400> today<00:04:39.940> now

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
recycled plastic as you saw in today now

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.510 
recycled plastic as you saw in today now
the<00:04:40.600> other<00:04:40.720> ideas<00:04:41.320> what<00:04:41.530> about<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.979> booms<00:04:42.250> and

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
the other ideas what about the booms and

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.800 
the other ideas what about the booms and
the<00:04:42.610> booms<00:04:42.789> are<00:04:42.940> what<00:04:43.090> float<00:04:43.389> on<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.570> water

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the booms are what float on the water

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.810 
the booms are what float on the water
absorb<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.440> oil<00:04:44.470> what<00:04:45.039> about<00:04:45.250> those<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.699> are

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
absorb the oil what about those that are

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.610 
absorb the oil what about those that are
full<00:04:46.000> of<00:04:46.120> like<00:04:46.270> straw<00:04:46.630> or<00:04:46.900> chicken<00:04:47.229> feathers

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
full of like straw or chicken feathers

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.350 
full of like straw or chicken feathers
or<00:04:47.770> something<00:04:48.039> like<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.160> well<00:04:48.940> on<00:04:49.150> those

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
or something like that well on those

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.939 
or something like that well on those
what<00:04:49.840> we<00:04:49.960> would<00:04:50.139> do<00:04:50.259> is<00:04:50.350> we<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.560> equipment

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
what we would do is we have equipment

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.189 
what we would do is we have equipment
they<00:04:51.280> would<00:04:51.460> make<00:04:51.669> them<00:04:51.850> into<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.120> log<00:04:52.449> that<00:04:53.050> we

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
they would make them into a log that we

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.830 
they would make them into a log that we
could<00:04:53.380> actually<00:04:53.620> use<00:04:53.889> with<00:04:54.820> plastic<00:04:55.570> in<00:04:55.720> them

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
could actually use with plastic in them

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.140 
could actually use with plastic in them
as<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.050> fuel<00:04:56.530> pellet<00:04:56.889> again<00:04:57.550> putting<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.030> right

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
as a fuel pellet again putting it right

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.050 
as a fuel pellet again putting it right
back<00:04:58.389> into<00:04:58.630> into<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> environment<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.250> you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
back into into the environment so you

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.060 
back into into the environment so you
know<00:05:01.180> good<00:05:01.419> luck<00:05:01.599> and<00:05:01.840> hopefully<00:05:02.110> we'll<00:05:02.889> get<00:05:02.979> a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
know good luck and hopefully we'll get a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.630 
know good luck and hopefully we'll get a
chance<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.460> show<00:05:03.639> you<00:05:03.699> what<00:05:03.849> we<00:05:03.940> can<00:05:03.970> do<00:05:04.240> thanks
