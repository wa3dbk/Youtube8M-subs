00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 what are friends of youtube welcome to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.950
 a boyfriend and well I'm in a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.660
 tutorial on how to go super fast 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.820
 teleport or whatever you want 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.550
 take in minecraft pocket edition this 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.109
 well they 're going to have to be what 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:29.359
 It is a very simple structure 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.359
 made passionate about survival since 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:39.220
 Well, I do not know what with the editor package 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.220
 this you use eggs or you put 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.129
 and here 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.960
 these eggs as I said this alone to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.280
 see if it opens me because sometimes I lose 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.949
 the world 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.530
 I do not know why it happened to me but 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.400
 I always end up losing the worlds 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 good anyway 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.360
 they will see this pretty much what they have 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.930
 that I am going to create a new one for 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.000
 send them since they always give you errors 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.000
 always said I have nothing because my 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.480
 game I almost did not play minecraft anymore 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.400
 petition 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.420
 well you just have to make one 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:37.490
 two for two like that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.329
 and leave one as if not 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.329
 this Yes 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.850
 in anything because I can not 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.570
 to consider 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.570
 good 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.090
 to put it so he would respond to 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 put a chairs 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.909
 then with cows and here we see one of 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 the fattest animals, it's going to be 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.200
 so then depends depends the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.359
 number of cows and what they will continue 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.600
 is that you teleported or 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:12.720
 running super celery 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.250
 for saying here I'm going to put many many 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.250
 it's okay 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.170
 if you can see it but how do you 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.990
 It takes a tad farther but in case I 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.980
 I put 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.670
 this one more because it also even serves with 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.209
 with animals said as having emos 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.209
 if you with that if you put if you put a 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.209
 sandoval 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.030
 that is, they do not always follow but when 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.640
 you approach you fly away I'm going to run 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.310
 Super fast 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.959
 I already know that maybe maybe not such 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.680
 Once they knew him, maybe not yet 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.390
 they knew but well if they already known 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.050
 because that good and if not, than good 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.600
 so that's how good I was 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.280
 inactive this these days as always 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.950
 I 'm always active but good 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.200
 Well, because I went on vacation to 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.200
 puerto vallarta and then 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.120
 and then I have made me take my tablet but 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.250
 a friend of the charger 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 but he did not give me the charger then 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.810
 What a fool 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.830
 then for saying that I put many 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.980
 cows and entered albacar longer 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.430
 then you get out 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.150
 and it sends you flying forgiveness because it looks 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.110
 So ugly but good while cows 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.110
 they liked to be you 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.650
 it's as if you teleport this because 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.650
 if you give it a use, then you can 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.290
 use obviously good I think so 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.480
 so much more than said but not this 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.190
 can be used as you want 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.010
 you can do it and well, this one 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.549
 this would be if I'm not mistaken this 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.519
 I did not like so light 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.960
