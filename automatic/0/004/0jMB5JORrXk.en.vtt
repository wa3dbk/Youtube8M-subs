originally we had in a space an old
coffee<00:01:44.000> table<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.110> was<00:01:45.229> just<00:01:45.440> too<00:01:45.649> big<00:01:45.860> so

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
coffee table but it was just too big so

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
it was perfect color it just needed a

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.790 
it was perfect color it just needed a
little<00:01:56.000> height<00:01:56.420> that's<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:57.349> we<00:01:57.470> found<00:01:57.649> some

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
little height that's when we found some

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.740 
little height that's when we found some
perfect<00:01:58.250> cast<00:01:58.429> iron<00:01:58.670> legs<00:01:58.819> that<00:01:59.209> we<00:01:59.360> added<00:01:59.599> to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
perfect cast iron legs that we added to

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.359 
perfect cast iron legs that we added to
the<00:01:59.899> lawn<00:02:00.050> of

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
so we had some great unconventional

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.399 
so we had some great unconventional
solutions<00:02:03.250> for<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> closet<00:02:03.789> area<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.750> like<00:02:05.259> the

industrial shelves that we used for

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.850 
industrial shelves that we used for
shoes<00:02:07.420> because<00:02:07.719> teenagers<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> lot<00:02:08.830> of

is clever for more Mihai space I have a
tour<00:02:22.299> guide<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.660> there<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.319> had<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.620> pegboard

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
tour guide in there we had the pegboard

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.039 
tour guide in there we had the pegboard
DIY<00:02:24.489> yeah<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:25.209> looked<00:02:25.450> really<00:02:25.780> really<00:02:25.930> good

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
DIY yeah that looked really really good

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.070

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
of makeup area that we created with

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.030 
of makeup area that we created with
those<00:02:31.090> old<00:02:31.360> wine<00:02:31.870> crates<00:02:32.260> there<00:02:32.440> was<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> vest

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
those old wine crates there was a vest

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.160 
those old wine crates there was a vest
that<00:02:33.160> jutted<00:02:33.670> out<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> good<00:02:34.510> use<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
that jutted out so is a good use of the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.949 
that jutted out so is a good use of the
space<00:02:35.319> yeah<00:02:36.180> using<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.269> bulkhead<00:02:37.690> as<00:02:37.930> a

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
space yeah using the bulkhead as a

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.020 
space yeah using the bulkhead as a
jumping-off<00:02:38.500> point<00:02:38.829> too<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> great<00:02:39.579> idea<00:02:39.940> I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
jumping-off point too is a great idea I

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.479 
jumping-off point too is a great idea I
thought<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.380> naturally<00:02:41.620> divided<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
thought because it naturally divided the

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.610 
thought because it naturally divided the
closet<00:02:42.940> area<00:02:43.209> right<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.110> allowed<00:02:44.440> us<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
closet area right and it allowed us to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.160 
closet area right and it allowed us to
hang<00:02:44.920> those<00:02:45.099> rods<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.730> then<00:02:46.540> layer<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:47.049> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
hang those rods and then layer in the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.289 
hang those rods and then layer in the
two<00:02:47.349> different<00:02:47.950> types<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.400> curtains<00:02:48.849> which<00:02:49.150> is

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
two different types of curtains which is

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.119 
two different types of curtains which is
really<00:02:49.569> pretty<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.379> gave<00:02:50.500> us<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.860> walk-in

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
really pretty and it gave us a walk-in

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.250 
really pretty and it gave us a walk-in
closet<00:02:51.370> space<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.060> did<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.599> now<00:02:52.720> came<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.079> fun

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
part the decorating where we layered in

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.569 
part the decorating where we layered in
all<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.140> pretty<00:02:56.349> bits<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.769> pieces<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.430> make

of<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.990> fox<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.920> thought<00:03:50.220> they're<00:03:50.370> really

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
of a fox and I thought they're really

don't<00:03:55.860> think<00:03:56.040> anything<00:03:56.430> could<00:03:56.550> be<00:03:56.610> worse<00:03:56.880> than

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
don't think anything could be worse than

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.780 
don't think anything could be worse than
flush<00:03:57.780> mounts<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.070> basement<00:03:59.550> for<00:03:59.760> a
