00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.590
 we come back here to our neutral corner 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.350
 of the technical section of the night of 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.470
 boxing brand the wall as we promised 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.760
 the week before we are going to do the 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:23.480
 defenses of direct deviations to 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.400
 body of agreement care with this that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.130
 it's a defensive technique but it has 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.410
 their danger because that separate 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.239
 quite the hands of our face 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.660
 ok you have to be very careful detour 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.199
 detour diversion detour we go to the gym 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.050
 and let's see what's going on with this here 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.050
 the night of marcatv boxing 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.980
 well let's see how we avoid the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.510
 direct to the body in chapters 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.760
 previous we saw it a little bit 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.400
 above and today we're going to work with the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.910
 detours trying not to move too much 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 the elbows first and very important is 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.430
 a very risky defense because 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.350
 because we separated enough hands from 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.450
 the face we see how the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.090
 straight from left to the body and we should 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.649
 as we deviate with the hand behind 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.990
 and we see how the rest of us throws 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.259
 right and how we deviate with our 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.770
 forward hand let's see some possible 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.229
 cons on your left challenge me 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.869
 detour with right from there I would go 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.110
 immediately with my direct right 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.959
 or let's say that he counterattacked with the same 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.359
 hand that diverts that is now we see how 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:45.289
 the rest of right I detour with my hand 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:48.289
 left and from there he would counterattack 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.929
 with microchem of left on the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.140
 rest left immediately 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.289
 after he lowered his hand 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.000
 would connect to a direct right to the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.640
 face this is a blunt blow 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.670
 It has its complication but it is one of the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.569
 defenses and counterattack outputs that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.489
 more we like good up here the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.560
 defenses of the direct ones to the body we go 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.170
 to leave for a while the work of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 body and next week we return what 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.629
 promised is debt with defenses 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.030
 combined yes in the previous week 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.980
 we work the blockade 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410
 with the horse in defense combined today 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.650
 we will work with the locking 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.410
 dodge rotary and get out hitting but 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.140
 for that you have to wait for us 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 week seven days here we wait for you 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.780
 all in the night of marcatv boxing
