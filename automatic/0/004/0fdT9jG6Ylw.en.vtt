because the total is 128 so you can

precise<00:05:41.910> enough<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.510> Pillai<00:05:43.290> makes<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.710> with

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
precise enough and Pillai makes it with

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.440 
precise enough and Pillai makes it with
only<00:05:43.950> one<00:05:44.070> delivery<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:44.700> face<00:05:44.880> in<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.150> silver
