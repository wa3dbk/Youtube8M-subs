00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
in the case anyway so it couldn't be

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.150 
in the case anyway so it couldn't be
even<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.320> bit<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.530> rough<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.770> wouldn't<00:02:26.070> have

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
even a bit of rough I wouldn't have

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.030

something<00:05:33.600> hard<00:05:33.990> enough<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:35.220> is

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
something hard enough and this is

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.730 
something hard enough and this is
actually<00:05:35.840> quite<00:05:36.840> hard<00:05:37.170> quite<00:05:37.710> good

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
actually quite hard quite good

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.520
