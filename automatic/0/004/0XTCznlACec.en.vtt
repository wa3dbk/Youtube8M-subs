it's<00:02:04.249> uh<00:02:04.429> I<00:02:04.670> don't<00:02:04.939> really<00:02:05.179> know<00:02:05.420> how<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:06.100> give

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
it's uh I don't really know how I give

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.949 
it's uh I don't really know how I give
the<00:02:07.279> material<00:02:07.759> rating<00:02:08.149> it's<00:02:08.330> really<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.810> up

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
the material rating it's really you up

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.280 
the material rating it's really you up
like<00:02:09.229> prickly<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:10.039> first<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.240> like<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.659> guess

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
like prickly at first and like I guess

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.009 
like prickly at first and like I guess
it<00:02:12.439> gives<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.769> lot<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.950> traction<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.870> as

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
it gives a lot of traction but as it as

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.990 
it gives a lot of traction but as it as
you<00:02:15.590> use<00:02:15.739> them<00:02:15.950> more<00:02:16.129> that<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.430> starts<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.760> wear

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
you use them more that it starts to wear

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.350 
you use them more that it starts to wear
down

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
down

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.390 
down
so<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:19.420> guess<00:02:20.420> also<00:02:21.230> these<00:02:21.470> shoes<00:02:21.770> for

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so I guess also these shoes for

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.130 
so I guess also these shoes for
durability<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.180> think<00:02:23.900> they're<00:02:24.020> pretty

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
durability I think they're pretty

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.020 
durability I think they're pretty
durable<00:02:24.410> I've<00:02:24.740> had<00:02:25.220> these<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.790> cross

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
durable I've had these for to cross

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.560 
durable I've had these for to cross
country<00:02:26.240> seasons<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.990> one<00:02:27.500> season<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.070> track

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
country seasons and one season of track

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.080 
country seasons and one season of track
so<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.740> only<00:02:30.860> thing<00:02:30.950> that's<00:02:31.280> really<00:02:31.580> happened

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
so the only thing that's really happened

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.320 
so the only thing that's really happened
is<00:02:32.240> they<00:02:33.110> started<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.680> rip<00:02:33.950> right<00:02:34.850> there<00:02:35.090> which

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
is they started to rip right there which

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.310 
is they started to rip right there which
is<00:02:35.480> pretty<00:02:35.660> common<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.740> then<00:02:36.890> also<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
is pretty common and then also the the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.820 
is pretty common and then also the the
heel<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.860> heel<00:02:40.730> starting<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.330> fall<00:02:41.540> apart

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
heel the heel starting to fall apart

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.180 
heel the heel starting to fall apart
which<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.040> don't<00:02:43.100> think<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.400> too<00:02:43.700> big<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.570> deal

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
which I don't think is too big of a deal

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180 
which I don't think is too big of a deal
i'll<00:02:46.190> see<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:46.820> peoples<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:48.190> getting

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
i'll see like peoples like getting

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
i'll see like peoples like getting
spiked<00:02:49.610> or<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.300> starts<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.690> rip<00:02:50.900> apart<00:02:51.050> up<00:02:51.380> here

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
spiked or it starts to rip apart up here

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.030 
spiked or it starts to rip apart up here
so<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:51.800> guess<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.130> was<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.310> lucky<00:02:52.490> with<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.020> so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
so I guess I was just lucky with that so

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.479 
so I guess I was just lucky with that so
now<00:02:55.040> moving<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:55.610> distances<00:02:56.800> for<00:02:57.800> track<00:02:58.160> these

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
now moving on distances for track these

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.910 
now moving on distances for track these
are<00:02:58.640> best<00:02:58.880> used<00:02:59.180> for<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.989> 800<00:03:00.590> through<00:03:00.800> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
are best used for the 800 through the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.600 
are best used for the 800 through the
5,000<00:03:01.610> meters<00:03:01.880> or<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:03.020> high<00:03:03.380> school<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.950> don't

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
5,000 meters or in high school I don't

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.000 
5,000 meters or in high school I don't
know<00:03:04.670> if<00:03:04.790> everyone<00:03:05.209> runs<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.860> don't<00:03:06.860> really

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
know if everyone runs I don't really

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.100 
know if everyone runs I don't really
know<00:03:07.310> what<00:03:07.640> everyone<00:03:08.000> runs<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:08.450> high<00:03:08.600> school<00:03:08.930> I

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
know what everyone runs in high school I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.600 
know what everyone runs in high school I
think<00:03:09.470> it's<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.800> different<00:03:10.130> all<00:03:10.370> throughout

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
think it's just different all throughout

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.180 
think it's just different all throughout
the<00:03:10.760> country<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:11.989> me<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.470> only<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.860> four

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
the country but for me we only have four

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
the country but for me we only have four
distance<00:03:13.580> it's<00:03:13.900> 800<00:03:14.900> through<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> two<00:03:15.380> miles

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
distance it's 800 through the two miles

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.490 
distance it's 800 through the two miles
so<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.670> could<00:03:16.820> use<00:03:17.000> these<00:03:17.180> through<00:03:17.930> both<00:03:18.200> or

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
so you could use these through both or

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.720 
so you could use these through both or
all<00:03:19.660> also<00:03:20.660> I've<00:03:20.930> heard<00:03:21.799> people<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.430> using

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
all also I've heard people like using

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.630 
all also I've heard people like using
these<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> 400<00:03:23.750> or<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.350> 100<00:03:24.890> even<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:25.430> I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
these in the 400 or the 100 even but I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.460 
these in the 400 or the 100 even but I
think<00:03:26.299> it'd<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.450> be<00:03:26.630> more<00:03:26.810> useful<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.170> buy

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
think it'd just be more useful to buy

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.460 
think it'd just be more useful to buy
like<00:03:27.709> our<00:03:28.280> real<00:03:28.549> sprinting<00:03:29.150> spike<00:03:29.510> these<00:03:30.290> are

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
like our real sprinting spike these are

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.560 
like our real sprinting spike these are
more<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.920> mid<00:03:31.130> distance<00:03:31.340> spike<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.420> can

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
more of a mid distance spike but you can

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.840 
more of a mid distance spike but you can
use<00:03:32.780> them<00:03:32.989> for<00:03:33.019> longer<00:03:33.410> events<00:03:33.920> I've<00:03:34.790> used

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
use them for longer events I've used

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.509 
use them for longer events I've used
I've<00:03:35.390> used<00:03:35.840> these<00:03:36.230> for<00:03:36.470> cross<00:03:36.680> country<00:03:36.709> like

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
I've used these for cross country like

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.550 
I've used these for cross country like
I've<00:03:37.700> said<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.450> only<00:03:38.600> thing<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:38.989> would

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
I've said the only thing that you would

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.229 
I've said the only thing that you would
like<00:03:39.739> want<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.220> watch<00:03:40.370> out<00:03:40.519> for<00:03:40.580> in<00:03:41.060> cross

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
like want to watch out for in cross

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.800 
like want to watch out for in cross
country<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:43.120> they<00:03:44.120> don't<00:03:44.360> have<00:03:44.420> as<00:03:44.660> much

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
country is that they don't have as much

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.259 
country is that they don't have as much
support<00:03:45.110> as<00:03:45.640> some<00:03:46.640> other<00:03:46.790> cross<00:03:47.060> country

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
support as some other cross country

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.800 
support as some other cross country
shoes<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.310> don't<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.700> like<00:03:50.120> they<00:03:50.510> can<00:03:50.690> get

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
shoes so I don't and like they can get

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.350 
shoes so I don't and like they can get
kind<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.200> uncomfortable<00:03:51.760> maybe<00:03:52.760> if<00:03:53.150> you're

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
kind of uncomfortable maybe if you're

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.140 
kind of uncomfortable maybe if you're
not<00:03:53.480> wearing<00:03:53.780> socks<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.670> like<00:03:55.670> if<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:55.940> don't

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
not wearing socks and like if you don't

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.729 
not wearing socks and like if you don't
mid-foot<00:03:56.540> strike<00:03:56.690> because<00:03:57.019> you<00:03:57.350> can<00:03:57.470> start<00:03:57.650> to

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
mid-foot strike because you can start to

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.280 
mid-foot strike because you can start to
get<00:03:57.860> blisters<00:03:58.280> but<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:59.390> guess<00:03:59.900> that's<00:04:00.140> all

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
get blisters but I guess that's all

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
get blisters but I guess that's all
preference<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:01.070> never<00:04:01.430> really<00:04:01.730> wore<00:04:01.940> socks

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
preference I never really wore socks
