00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.960
 At the heart of this Christmas is interactive presentation

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.079
 can practice immediately 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.440
 you complete the course with a test 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.170
 if you fail to do this, you will receive the certified certificate as proof 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.310
 of your knowledge 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.380
 keep looking with you now see a selection of screen and i have 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.380
 interactive presentation 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 you need a few things to play a football match 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.970
 as the first field that is big enough to play on 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.440
 the minimum dimensions of the soccer field are 90 by 45 meters 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.340
 the maximum dimensions of the field and 120 by 90 meters 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.960
 often the small fields are made by half of a big money 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.980
 and from there to play from the big money 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.020
 according to an international football, the ideal dimensions of a field are 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.090
 organization 105 by 68 meters 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.930
 in the second place 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 these too can have different dimensions tailored to the size of the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140
 field 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.219
 the do on a field with minimal dimensions there are of course smaller 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.390
 the maximum size of an interpreter is two meters 44 eye in seven meters 32 breaks 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.249
 the goal posts and the bar we have to be white with 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.150
 finally, four flagpoles are required on a soccer field 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 these must be at least 1.5 meters long 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.890
 the half-pole flag can be seen on the screen as a red-colored cisco 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.600
 The flagpole one now has four corners of the field 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.380
 they are needed to be able to see when the ball is as it is called across the sidelines or 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.949
 has crossed the goal line 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.819
 around a flagpole I put a quarter within the lines of the football field 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.819
 cook marked in a radius of one meter 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.280
 upon seeing a violation, the referee whistles and points to 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.350
 the place where the violation was committed 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.660
 and travels with his hand to half the party who has the violation 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.189
 to commit 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.680
 for a violation that the referee has not seen the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 assistant referee raise his flag 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.680
 if a whistle blows, the assistant gives the referee his flag 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.599
 offer for violations was made and where this violation took place 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.939
 in the case of offside, the flag is also done by the assistant referee 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.989
 because the referee usually cannot see this properly 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.550
 almost nothing ball 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.860
 quick flag done and then with the flag between both hands 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.860
 appointed by the assistant referee 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.789
