on door now so this course one way is
3.2<00:01:05.460> kilometres<00:01:06.090> long<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> come<00:01:07.380> back

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
3.2 kilometres long but if you come back

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.710 
3.2 kilometres long but if you come back
if<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> distance<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.580> six<00:01:09.150> point<00:01:09.420> four

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
if the distance is about six point four

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.620 
if the distance is about six point four
kilometres<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.460> speed<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.060> goes<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
kilometres and the speed it goes up to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
kilometres and the speed it goes up to
about<00:01:12.720> 15<00:01:13.380> kilometers<00:01:13.979> per<00:01:14.280> hour<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
about 15 kilometers per hour now you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
about 15 kilometers per hour now you
would<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
would think that because it's on a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
would think that because it's on a
railway<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.479> rail<00:01:18.810> bike<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.409> kind<00:01:19.650> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
railway this rail bike would be kind of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.670 
railway this rail bike would be kind of
rusty<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> opposite<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
rusty but it's actually the opposite the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
rusty but it's actually the opposite the
body<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.340> makes<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.299> rail<00:01:24.869> bike<00:01:25.110> move

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
body actually makes the rail bike move

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.950 
body actually makes the rail bike move
quite<00:01:25.680> smoothly<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.390> nice<00:01:27.659> here
