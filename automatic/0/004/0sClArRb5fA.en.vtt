00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
him but he did actually have quite a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
him but he did actually have quite a
consistent<00:00:32.070> season<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.579> maybe<00:00:33.120> we'll<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.540> an

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
consistent season so maybe we'll be an

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.940 
consistent season so maybe we'll be an
81<00:00:33.989> we'll<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> upcoming

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
81 we'll have to see in the upcoming

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.490 
81 we'll have to see in the upcoming
weeks<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.640> EA<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:36.180> give<00:00:36.450> him<00:00:36.630> next<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.440> we

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
weeks what EA will give him next up we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
weeks what EA will give him next up we
do<00:00:37.620> math<00:00:37.920> you'll<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> he's<00:00:38.610> gone<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:38.910> 74

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
do math you'll out and he's gone from 74

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
do math you'll out and he's gone from 74
to<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.899> 74<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> don't<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.190> he<00:00:41.430> does

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to a 74 because I don't think he does

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
to a 74 because I don't think he does
deserve<00:00:41.790> an<00:00:42.030> upgrade<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> 74<00:00:43.410> write

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
deserve an upgrade I think the 74 write

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
deserve an upgrade I think the 74 write
a<00:00:43.590> card<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:43.920> him<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.399> fair<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
a card for him is very fair because you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.819 
a card for him is very fair because you
only<00:00:45.480> played<00:00:45.660> 15<00:00:45.809> games<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.379> year<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
only played 15 games this year so you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160 
only played 15 games this year so you
won't<00:00:47.039> exactly<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.789> rating<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.420> obviously

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
won't exactly go up rating so obviously

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.479 
won't exactly go up rating so obviously
keeping<00:00:49.500> him<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> same<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.460> good

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
keeping him the same will be really good

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
keeping him the same will be really good
I've<00:00:50.879> changed<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.329> attacks<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> there

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
came very close but the saying that they

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.170 
came very close but the saying that they
have<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.830> weak<00:01:05.070> team<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.519> Floyd<00:01:05.790> shows

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
have a really weak team from Floyd shows

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.510 
have a really weak team from Floyd shows
how<00:01:06.390> Louie<00:01:07.080> van<00:01:07.290> how<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.740> turn<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.280> crap

obviously<00:01:11.010> i<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.700> deserved<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
obviously i think it just deserved the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.750 
obviously i think it just deserved the
okay<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> 79<00:01:13.200> rate<00:01:13.409> card<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.159> 60<00:01:14.580> paise

that's<00:01:25.259> basically<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that's basically what I did it on and I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
that's basically what I did it on and I
basically<00:01:27.119> kept<00:01:27.689> his<00:01:27.810> rate<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> same<00:01:28.350> but

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
basically kept his rate in the same but

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
basically kept his rate in the same but
I've<00:01:28.890> downgraded<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.759> his<00:01:29.850> SATs<00:01:30.090> are

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
I've downgraded some of his SATs are

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
I've downgraded some of his SATs are
basically<00:01:30.720> some<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> these<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.500> head<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
basically some of these are from head to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 
basically some of these are from head to
head<00:01:32.250> basically<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.909> upgrades<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
head basically the upgrades are kind of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
head basically the upgrades are kind of
fair<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.650> I've<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.130> researched

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
fair because I've actually researched

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
fair because I've actually researched
and<00:01:36.090> seen<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.350> real

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and seen what they actually are in real

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.039 
and seen what they actually are in real
life<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> stuff<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.460> next<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.900> do

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
life and stuff like that next up we do

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
life and stuff like that next up we do
have<00:01:40.079> Kieran<00:01:40.740> Richardson<00:01:40.890> he's<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
have Kieran Richardson he's actually a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
have Kieran Richardson he's actually a
trance<00:01:42.000> fees<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.810> played<00:01:43.500> at

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
trance fees and not actually played at

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
trance fees and not actually played at
Aston<00:01:43.950> Villa<00:01:44.100> before<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.939> he<00:01:45.060> will

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
Aston Villa before but I think he will

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
Aston Villa before but I think he will
go<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.229> left-back<00:01:46.590> start<00:01:46.829> straight<00:01:47.070> away

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
go to the left-back start straight away

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
go to the left-back start straight away
in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> first<00:01:47.610> team<00:01:47.790> line<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.020> be

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
in the first team line up so it will be

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.300 
in the first team line up so it will be
a<00:01:49.170> pretty<00:01:49.350> good<00:01:49.530> transfer<00:01:49.860> he's<00:01:50.040> got<00:01:50.189> some

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a pretty good transfer he's got some

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
a pretty good transfer he's got some
really<00:01:50.490> nice<00:01:50.700> rounded<00:01:51.119> stats<00:01:51.390> I've<00:01:51.630> done

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
really nice rounded stats I've done

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.330 
really nice rounded stats I've done
quite<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.470> few<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:52.979> because

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
quite a few of them down because

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.460 
quite a few of them down because
obviously<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:54.090> he's<00:01:54.540> getting<00:01:54.810> old<00:01:54.899> he's<00:01:55.170> not

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
obviously as he's getting old he's not

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
obviously as he's getting old he's not
gonna<00:01:55.619> develop<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.640> he's<00:01:56.850> gonna<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.240> downhill

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
gonna develop and he's gonna go downhill

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.510 
gonna develop and he's gonna go downhill
from<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.920> unfortunate<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.430> him

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
from now so a bit unfortunate of him

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
from now so a bit unfortunate of him
Kieran<00:01:59.820> Richardson<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.420> still<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.990> good

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
Kieran Richardson but still a very good

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.740 
Kieran Richardson but still a very good

just deserve it 277 rate of gaudiya

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.850 
62 rato to or 69 rated I think that's a
fair<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:42.960> great<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.380> him<00:02:43.470> haven't<00:02:43.710> seen

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
fair with great for him haven't seen

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.470 
fair with great for him haven't seen
actually<00:02:44.190> playing<00:02:44.490> real<00:02:44.670> life<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.300> lot<00:02:45.450> of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
actually playing real life but a lot of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390 
actually playing real life but a lot of
people<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:45.930> rain<00:02:46.140> how<00:02:46.470> quite<00:02:46.860> highly<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
people do rain how quite highly so I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.980 
people do rain how quite highly so I
think<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.670> 60<00:02:47.970> damn<00:02:48.090> rare<00:02:48.270> card<00:02:48.540> will<00:02:48.690> be<00:02:48.720> pretty

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
think a 60 damn rare card will be pretty

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.840 
think a 60 damn rare card will be pretty
fair<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.410> me<00:02:49.530> will<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:50.220> good<00:02:50.340> 69

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
fair for me will be a really good 69

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.700 
fair for me will be a really good 69
right<00:02:51.000> car<00:02:51.240> because<00:02:51.540> 77<00:02:52.350> pays<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
right car because 77 pays and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.110 
right car because 77 pays and
seventy-seventh<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.730> very<00:02:53.850> good

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
seventy-seventh really is very good

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.730 
seventy-seventh really is very good
obviously<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.750> other<00:02:54.930> stats<00:02:55.200> aren't<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> best

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
obviously as other stats aren't the best

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.350 
obviously as other stats aren't the best
he's<00:02:56.250> defending<00:02:56.610> heading<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:56.940> absolutely

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
he's defending heading is absolutely

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.180 
he's defending heading is absolutely
poor<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:57.840> I've<00:02:58.200> upgraded<00:02:58.350> them<00:02:58.710> quite<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> bit

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
poor so I've upgraded them quite a bit

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.340 
poor so I've upgraded them quite a bit
and<00:02:59.580> kept<00:03:00.240> all<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.570> stats<00:03:00.870> pretty<00:03:01.080> much<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and kept all the stats pretty much the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.160 
and kept all the stats pretty much the
same<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.070> next<00:03:02.640> play<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.970> Andreas<00:03:03.660> Weimann

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
same so the next play is Andreas Weimann

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.870 
same so the next play is Andreas Weimann
I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.680> will<00:03:04.800> be<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> gold<00:03:05.250> next<00:03:05.550> year<00:03:05.670> but

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
I think you will be a gold next year but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.980 
I think you will be a gold next year but
I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.240> will<00:03:06.330> be<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> right<00:03:06.750> winger

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
I think you will be a right winger

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.890 
I think you will be a right winger
because<00:03:07.380> Aston<00:03:08.340> Villa<00:03:08.490> play<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> 433<00:03:09.690> with

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
because Aston Villa play like a 433 with

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.750 
because Aston Villa play like a 433 with
benteke<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.590> middle<00:03:10.830> Wyman<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.580> right

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
benteke in the middle Wyman on the right

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.820 
benteke in the middle Wyman on the right
and<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.360> bungler<00:03:12.660> hall<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.020> left<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.650> I

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
and a bungler hall on the left so I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.260 
and a bungler hall on the left so I
think<00:03:14.100> that's<00:03:14.340> what<00:03:14.490> they'll<00:03:14.610> do<00:03:14.820> next<00:03:14.850> year

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
think that's what they'll do next year

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.930 
think that's what they'll do next year
with<00:03:15.510> Wyman<00:03:15.960> put<00:03:16.140> into<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.350> 75<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.160> basically

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
with Wyman put into a 75 and basically

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.240 
with Wyman put into a 75 and basically
put<00:03:18.210> them<00:03:18.300> out<00:03:18.450> wide<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.200> right<00:03:19.470> next<00:03:20.040> up

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
put them out wide on the right next up

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.500 
put them out wide on the right next up

same as him basically put them to a 75
rated<00:03:24.000> left<00:03:24.240> winger<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.660> think<00:03:24.870> I'd<00:03:24.960> be<00:03:25.050> a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
rated left winger I think I'd be a

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.710 
rated left winger I think I'd be a
really<00:03:25.380> cool<00:03:25.590> card<00:03:25.800> still<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.310> obviously<00:03:27.270> it

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
really cool card still and obviously it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.780 
really cool card still and obviously it
will<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:27.960> quite<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.200> bargain<00:03:28.470> average<00:03:29.250> em<00:03:29.490> so

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
will be quite a bargain average em so

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.310 
will be quite a bargain average em so
that'd<00:03:30.000> be<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.270> cool<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.720> bunk<00:03:30.990> Lahore

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
that'd be really cool for a bunk Lahore

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.870 
that'd be really cool for a bunk Lahore
and<00:03:31.500> obviously<00:03:32.040> being<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.520> left<00:03:32.700> hand

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.900 
player this week I think he's a rating I
was<00:03:40.590> tempted<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.010> downgrade<00:03:41.190> into<00:03:41.610> an<00:03:41.700> 80

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
was tempted to downgrade into an 80

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.910 
was tempted to downgrade into an 80

aston<00:03:46.260> villa<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:46.500> absolutely<00:03:47.160> incredible

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
aston villa was absolutely incredible

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
aston villa was absolutely incredible
but<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.330> shay<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.810> didn't<00:03:49.050> quite<00:03:49.260> make<00:03:49.500> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
but this shay just didn't quite make it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.890
