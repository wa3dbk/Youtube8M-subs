trim<00:02:23.129> them<00:02:23.280> down<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.610> fit<00:02:23.730> through<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.969> gap

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
trim them down to fit through the gap

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.809 
trim them down to fit through the gap
and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.420> they<00:02:24.540> slide<00:02:25.499> in<00:02:25.769> like<00:02:26.060> that

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
and then they slide in like that

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.050 
and then they slide in like that
tabs<00:02:28.360> hold<00:02:28.629> in<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.230> your<00:02:29.349> bolt<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:30.489> tow<00:02:30.879> bar

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
tabs hold in and your bolt your tow bar

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.960 
tabs hold in and your bolt your tow bar
to<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.900> there<00:02:32.080> we<00:02:32.170> go<00:02:32.760> sliding<00:02:33.760> there

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
to that so there we go sliding there

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
to that so there we go sliding there
nicely<00:02:34.150> nuts<00:02:34.569> or<00:02:34.810> square<00:02:35.080> hole<00:02:35.290> for<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.709> four

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
nicely nuts or square hole for this four

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.470 
nicely nuts or square hole for this four
tabs<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.610> round<00:02:36.760> hole<00:02:37.000> obviously

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
tabs and then the round hole obviously

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.780 
tabs and then the round hole obviously
is<00:02:37.810> where<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.989> bolt<00:02:38.200> goes<00:02:38.409> through<00:02:38.790> straight

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
is where the bolt goes through straight

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.820 
is where the bolt goes through straight
into<00:02:40.090> your<00:02:40.239> captive<00:02:40.840> nut<00:02:40.989> or<00:02:41.140> cage<00:02:41.379> knife<00:02:41.709> if

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
into your captive nut or cage knife if

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.250 
into your captive nut or cage knife if
you<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:42.069> these<00:02:42.519> are<00:02:42.730> we<00:02:42.819> captive<00:02:43.269> welded<00:02:44.140> on

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you like these are we captive welded on

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
you like these are we captive welded on
so<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.040> should<00:02:45.190> be<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> bit<00:02:45.400> stronger<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.819> well

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
so it should be a bit stronger as well

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000 
so it should be a bit stronger as well
afterwards<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> tow<00:02:47.019> bar<00:02:47.230> right<00:02:47.739> let's<00:02:47.920> go

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
afterwards is a tow bar right let's go

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.089 
afterwards is a tow bar right let's go
and<00:02:48.099> do<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.319> there's<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.650> little<00:02:50.799> CAD

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
and do it so there's that little CAD

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.050 
and do it so there's that little CAD
design<00:02:51.720> cardboard<00:02:52.720> aided<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.610> we've<00:02:55.030> just

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
design cardboard aided and we've just

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.850 
design cardboard aided and we've just
done<00:02:55.390> traced<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.959> onto<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.290> little<00:02:56.500> piece<00:02:56.680> of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
done traced it onto this little piece of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.009 
done traced it onto this little piece of
one-mile<00:02:57.640> still<00:02:57.849> I<00:02:57.879> found<00:02:58.209> why<00:02:58.599> one<00:02:58.810> male

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
one-mile still I found why one male

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.710 
one-mile still I found why one male
still<00:03:01.530> found<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.370> its<00:03:03.879> completed<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.569> use

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
still found it and its completed to use

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.360 
still found it and its completed to use
than<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.989> do<00:03:05.140> male<00:03:05.349> still<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.829> had<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.099> be<00:03:06.250> off

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
than the do male still I had to be off

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.339 
than the do male still I had to be off
cut<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:07.060> don't<00:03:07.480> think<00:03:07.599> I<00:03:07.660> managed<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.140> get

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
cut so I don't think I managed to get

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.490 
cut so I don't think I managed to get
those<00:03:08.470> tabs<00:03:08.790> done<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:10.239> Gmail<00:03:10.900> still<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.319> one

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
those tabs done in Gmail still and one

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.050 
those tabs done in Gmail still and one
must<00:03:11.650> over<00:03:11.920> still<00:03:12.220> more<00:03:12.519> than<00:03:12.670> twice<00:03:12.879> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
must over still more than twice the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.569 
must over still more than twice the
thickness<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.569> those<00:03:14.230> original<00:03:14.470> cage<00:03:15.280> nuts

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
thickness of those original cage nuts

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.280 
thickness of those original cage nuts
which<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.269> buy<00:03:16.390> for<00:03:16.450> thirty<00:03:16.780> quid<00:03:17.019> for<00:03:17.170> as

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
which you can buy for thirty quid for as

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.069 
which you can buy for thirty quid for as
air<00:03:17.410> for<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.340> cut<00:03:18.760> one<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:18.970> these<00:03:19.090> out<00:03:19.269> I'll<00:03:19.780> cut

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
air for so cut one of these out I'll cut

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.170 
air for so cut one of these out I'll cut
them<00:03:20.200> all<00:03:20.260> out<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:20.650> we'll<00:03:21.489> go<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.790> play

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
them all out and then we'll go and play

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.369 
them all out and then we'll go and play
with<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.359> bending<00:03:22.690> make<00:03:22.900> sure<00:03:22.989> we<00:03:23.079> get<00:03:23.200> one

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
with the bending make sure we get one

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.809 
with the bending make sure we get one
right<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.099> we<00:03:24.190> can<00:03:24.310> copy<00:03:24.489> them<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.879> others

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
right and we can copy them on the others

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.430 
right and we can copy them on the others
so<00:03:27.819> there<00:03:27.940> we<00:03:28.030> go

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
so there we go

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.680 
so there we go
poor<00:03:29.440> little<00:03:29.560> bits<00:03:29.799> cut<00:03:30.040> out<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:31.390> I'll<00:03:31.480> need<00:03:31.569> to

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
poor little bits cut out so I'll need to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.009 
poor little bits cut out so I'll need to
just<00:03:31.870> do<00:03:32.019> now<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:32.620> bend<00:03:33.250> those<00:03:33.489> tabs<00:03:34.019> so

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
just do now is just bend those tabs so

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.559 
just do now is just bend those tabs so
I'll<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.410> sit<00:03:35.650> round<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.940> then<00:03:37.419> walk<00:03:37.540> your

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
I'll just sit round and then walk your

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.430 
I'll just sit round and then walk your
markup<00:03:38.400> hole<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.510> then<00:03:40.750> here's<00:03:40.989> our<00:03:41.079> nuts<00:03:41.319> and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
markup hole and then here's our nuts and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.520 
markup hole and then here's our nuts and
bolts<00:03:41.799> we're<00:03:42.130> going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.400> go<00:03:42.489> on<00:03:42.669> so<00:03:43.480> they'll<00:03:43.660> go

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
bolts we're going to go on so they'll go

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.050 
bolts we're going to go on so they'll go
on<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> backside<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.340> one<00:03:45.579> front<00:03:45.880> side

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
on the backside of that one front side

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.849 
on the backside of that one front side
we<00:03:46.359> manage<00:03:46.690> where<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.019> LT<00:03:47.440> depends<00:03:47.709> on<00:03:47.799> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
we manage where the LT depends on the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.110 
we manage where the LT depends on the
way<00:03:47.980> I've<00:03:48.069> bend<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.370> tabs<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.889> can

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
way I've bend the tabs and then we can

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.470 
way I've bend the tabs and then we can
weld<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.299> onto<00:03:52.569> there<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.190> that's<00:03:54.190> nice

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
weld that onto there and that's nice

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.449 
weld that onto there and that's nice
captive<00:03:55.480> nut<00:03:55.840> effectively<00:03:56.440> Cajun<00:03:56.889> up<00:03:57.010> welded

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
captive nut effectively Cajun up welded

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.879 
captive nut effectively Cajun up welded
and<00:03:57.730> then<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:58.510> will<00:03:58.630> slot<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.079> nicely<00:03:59.319> and

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
and then that will slot in nicely and

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.710 
and then that will slot in nicely and
those<00:04:00.190> four<00:04:00.400> holes<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:00.730> saw<00:04:00.880> earlier<00:04:00.910> dubbed

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
those four holes you saw earlier dubbed

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.420 
those four holes you saw earlier dubbed
up<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:03.190> that's<00:04:03.340> all<00:04:04.030> our<00:04:04.209> tabs<00:04:04.950> bent<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:06.220> you

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
up so that's all our tabs bent in you

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.250 
up so that's all our tabs bent in you
can<00:04:06.579> see<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.060> need<00:04:07.180> quite<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> shoulder

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
can see that you need quite a shoulder

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.379 
can see that you need quite a shoulder
on<00:04:08.319> that<00:04:08.590> because<00:04:09.489> obviously<00:04:09.639> you're<00:04:10.090> putting

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
on that because obviously you're putting

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.050 
on that because obviously you're putting
it<00:04:10.480> through<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.370> chassis<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.910> the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
it through the the chassis and the
