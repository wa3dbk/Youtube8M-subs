dr. Wilson says the Thunder shirt is a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.330 
dr. Wilson says the Thunder shirt is a
good<00:02:56.760> alternative<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.780> tranquilizers<00:02:58.500> so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
good alternative to tranquilizers so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.530 
good alternative to tranquilizers so
it's<00:02:59.489> kind<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.730> nice<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.269> leave<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
it's kind of nice that you can leave the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.580 
it's kind of nice that you can leave the
house<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> they<00:03:00.989> already<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.500> on

house and they already have it on

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.400 
house and they already have it on
because<00:03:02.550> some<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.730> our<00:03:02.910> drugs<00:03:03.269> won't<00:03:03.840> last<00:03:04.110> all

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
because some of our drugs won't last all

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.530 
because some of our drugs won't last all
day<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.130> if<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.310> do<00:03:05.489> try<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:06.000> your<00:03:06.150> shirt

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
day but if you do try it on your shirt

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.900 
day but if you do try it on your shirt
you'll<00:03:06.690> probably<00:03:07.110> need<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.950> few<00:03:08.400> other<00:03:08.580> tricks

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
you'll probably need a few other tricks

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.750

up<00:03:09.300> your<00:03:09.330> sleeve<00:03:09.510> I've<00:03:10.380> seen<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> work<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.430> do

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
up your sleeve I've seen it work I do

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.699 
up your sleeve I've seen it work I do
think<00:03:12.390> though<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.930> doesn't<00:03:13.230> stand<00:03:13.500> alone

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
think though that it doesn't stand alone

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.710 
think though that it doesn't stand alone
I<00:03:14.160> don't<00:03:14.280> think<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.730> can<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:15.120> wrap<00:03:15.299> your<00:03:15.360> dog

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
I don't think you can just wrap your dog

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140 
I don't think you can just wrap your dog
in<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.959> shirt<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.500> he's<00:03:16.860> gonna<00:03:17.010> be<00:03:17.190> fine<00:03:17.489> with

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
in a shirt and he's gonna be fine with

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.870 
in a shirt and he's gonna be fine with
every<00:03:18.480> storm<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.069> it<00:03:20.400> will<00:03:20.580> help

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
every storm I think that it will help

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.110 
every storm I think that it will help
them<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.780> more<00:03:22.110> receptive<00:03:22.860> than<00:03:23.310> when<00:03:24.000> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
them to be more receptive than when you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.350 
them to be more receptive than when you
take<00:03:24.330> them<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.660> their<00:03:24.780> calm<00:03:25.080> place<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:26.360> talked
