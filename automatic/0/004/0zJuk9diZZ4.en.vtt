00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello friends welcome today we are going to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.480
 make a cambrai onion soup 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.480
 It is very rich I recommend them 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.550
 let's start what we need onions 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.050
 the onions of cambrai 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.840
 approximately we need 10 to 15 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.000
 onions are very big we can 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.579
 split into 4 parts so that we can 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.769
 eat more easily the stem what 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.570
 we have to wash very well and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.699
 use only the part that is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 green the parts that are like more 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.180
 dark those you do not have to use the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 green part that is closest to the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.100
 cebollita cambrai an ice cube and means 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.280
 of beef broth butter 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.840
 Parboil the onion 1 liter of water 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.150
 croutons cheese to melt and wine 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.970
 we put the onions in a saucepan 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.770
 with the butter and we let it 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.420
 are cars are spoon is that the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.950
 prettier look a little 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.870
 transparent 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.460
 in this way it will make the onion come out 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.460
 of the pulse by much 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 when being a little parboiled 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.700
 you put the stem to do exactly what 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.490
 same this green looks a little 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 transparent 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.299
 If necessary, you can put a 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.790
 little bit more butter the idea is 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.479
 that you see the onion a little 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.479
 transparent 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.320
 look in this way you can see that the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.900
 onion and you will feel it to be a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.130
 little bit soft and you start to see 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.130
 a little bit transparent 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 you can put a little bit of the salt that 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.340
 we have prepared the salt is the one 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.640
 use as the recipe that I gave you in the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.640
 past video gives a very rich touch 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.800
 Y 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.020
 when you see that it is already transparent that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.030
 it is already changed color is 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.480
 time to put the network consommÃ© and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.480
 Water 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.230
 i 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.849
 then to put the liter of water 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.870
 dissolve the beef broth and wait 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.110
 to boil the soup 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.680
 I suggest that the tap is for you to 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.340
 they sew more 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.050
 we leave it like that about 10 to 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.300
 15 minutes 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.030
 already when it 's boiling you can give 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.240
 tell if it's already because the onion already 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.170
 it looks a lot more transparent and you're going to 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.450
 see that it smells very rich and is soft 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.840
 I'm going to give this soup to my 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.790
 kids I'm not going to put wine but 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.400
 if you are only going to take adults 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.780
 you can put a splash of wine on 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.510
 trickle of wine I suggest you be 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.790
 red taste very good gives a very touch 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.550
 exquisite terrific the truth is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.860
 terrific and in this at this moment it is 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.440
 the time to put the cheese you stay what 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.840
 you can do there or you can do it in 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.570
 the dish I like to put on the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.940
 casserole to melt everything and to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.290
