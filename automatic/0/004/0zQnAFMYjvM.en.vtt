about<00:01:44.280> energy<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.170> explosion<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.439> think

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
about energy and explosion and I think

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
about energy and explosion and I think
that<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> very

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that what we have here is a very

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
that what we have here is a very
interesting<00:01:49.470> design<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:51.270> hope<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
interesting design I just hope the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.120 
interesting design I just hope the
energy<00:01:52.110> takes<00:01:52.350> me<00:01:52.500> forward<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> race

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
energy takes me forward in the race

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.760 
energy takes me forward in the race
I<00:01:54.160> hope<00:01:54.940> we<00:01:55.060> can<00:01:55.270> channel<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:55.630> energy<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:56.260> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
I hope we can channel that energy to to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.400 
I hope we can channel that energy to to
perform<00:01:57.390> an<00:01:58.390> ultimate<00:01:58.780> result<00:01:59.110> which<00:01:59.260> is

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
perform an ultimate result which is
