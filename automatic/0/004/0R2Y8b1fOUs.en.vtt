wanted to see what kinds of things were

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.269 
wanted to see what kinds of things were
out<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.380> knew<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> wanted<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> add<00:00:29.070> some

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
out there I knew I wanted to add some

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
out there I knew I wanted to add some
technology<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.000> classroom<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.660> when<00:00:31.650> I

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
technology to my classroom and when I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.959 
technology to my classroom and when I
was<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> saw<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.460> interactive

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
was there I saw the interactive

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.370 
was there I saw the interactive
whiteboard<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.719> thought<00:00:33.870> that's<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
whiteboard so I thought that's what I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.959 
whiteboard so I thought that's what I
wanted<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> went<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.430> principal

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
wanted to get so I went to my principal

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.700 
wanted to get so I went to my principal
and<00:00:36.149> asked<00:00:36.450> her<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.290> could<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.590> an

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and asked her if I could get an

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
and asked her if I could get an
interactive<00:00:38.190> whiteboard<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> she<00:00:39.480> gave<00:00:39.840> me

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
interactive whiteboard and she gave me

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
interactive whiteboard and she gave me
the<00:00:40.110> go-ahead<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> went<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.399> another

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the go-ahead and then I went to another

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.670 
the go-ahead and then I went to another
meeting<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.270> determine<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:42.930> interactive

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
meeting to determine which interactive

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.049 
meeting to determine which interactive
whiteboard<00:00:44.040> would<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> best<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.760> my

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
whiteboard would be the best one for my

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
whiteboard would be the best one for my
classroom<00:00:45.510> while<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.710> saw<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
classroom while I was there I saw the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.930 
classroom while I was there I saw the
AVerMedia<00:00:48.539> 530<00:00:49.320> document<00:00:49.860> camera<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> fell

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
AVerMedia 530 document camera and fell

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
AVerMedia 530 document camera and fell
in<00:00:51.090> love<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.899> that's<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> went

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
in love with it so that's what I went

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.889 
in love with it so that's what I went
back<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.340> principal<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> asked<00:00:54.690> her<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
back to my principal and asked her if I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.939 
back to my principal and asked her if I
could<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> instead<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.949> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
could get that instead and I have it so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
could get that instead and I have it so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
why did you prefer to purchase a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
why did you prefer to purchase a
document<00:01:01.140> camera<00:01:01.440> versus<00:01:01.829> all<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> other

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
would replace my overhead projector

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
would replace my overhead projector

their work right away other kids could
read<00:01:36.900> along<00:01:37.770> instead<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.340> listening<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
read along instead of just listening to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
read along instead of just listening to
their<00:01:39.000> answers<00:01:39.829> since<00:01:40.829> using<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.280> document

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
their answers since using your document

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
their answers since using your document
camera<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> noticed<00:01:42.509> any<00:01:42.780> advantages

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
camera have you noticed any advantages

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.639 
camera have you noticed any advantages
over<00:01:44.040> using<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.549> interactive<00:01:45.270> whiteboard<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
over using an interactive whiteboard I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.520 
over using an interactive whiteboard I
like<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.610> said<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.270> helps<00:01:48.420> them<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.020> be

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
like I said I think it helps them to be

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.649 
like I said I think it helps them to be
able<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.920> show<00:01:50.399> their<00:01:50.670> work<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:51.090> away<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
able to show their work right away and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.050 
able to show their work right away and
therefore<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.890> lots<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.369> students<00:01:53.700> wanting

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
therefore I get lots of students wanting

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
therefore I get lots of students wanting
to<00:01:54.180> raise<00:01:54.570> their<00:01:54.810> hand<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.079> participate

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to raise their hand and participate

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.859 
to raise their hand and participate
students<00:01:56.490> who<00:01:56.579> may<00:01:56.790> normally<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
students who may normally not want to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
students who may normally not want to
share<00:01:58.290> their<00:01:58.530> work<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.250> eager<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.759> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
share their work are more eager to do so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
share their work are more eager to do so
I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.509> part<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.469> they<00:02:01.590> can

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I think part of that's because they can

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
I think part of that's because they can
go<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.210> students<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
go right up there and the students the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.109 
go right up there and the students the
rest<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> class<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.100> looking<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.610> their

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
rest of the class is looking at their

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.789 
rest of the class is looking at their
work<00:02:06.360> rather<00:02:06.689> than<00:02:06.869> them<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:07.619> they're

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
work rather than them when they're

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.820 
work rather than them when they're
reading<00:02:08.220> their<00:02:08.489> answer<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> know<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.289> have

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
reading their answer so I know you have

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.680 
reading their answer so I know you have
benefited<00:02:11.400> right<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> bat<00:02:12.120> from<00:02:12.390> using

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
benefited right off the bat from using

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.140 
benefited right off the bat from using
your<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> ver

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
your a ver

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.630 
your a ver
530<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.110> classroom<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:14.680> what<00:02:15.159> benefits

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
530 in the classroom but what benefits

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.429 
530 in the classroom but what benefits
have<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.939> noticed<00:02:16.209> your<00:02:16.420> students<00:02:17.049> receiving

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
have you noticed your students receiving

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.020 
have you noticed your students receiving
from<00:02:17.769> using<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.189> document<00:02:18.610> camera<00:02:18.790> on<00:02:19.000> a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
from using the document camera on a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.780 
from using the document camera on a
daily<00:02:19.239> basis<00:02:19.799> yes<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> students

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
daily basis yes I think the students

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.610 
daily basis yes I think the students
have<00:02:21.909> benefited<00:02:22.510> greatly<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.379> neatness

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
have benefited greatly with the neatness

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.130 
have benefited greatly with the neatness
in<00:02:23.920> their<00:02:24.069> work<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.970> has<00:02:25.180> improved<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.870> big

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
in their work that has improved a big

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.470 
in their work that has improved a big
deal<00:02:26.349> because<00:02:26.560> they<00:02:26.860> know<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.430> I'm<00:02:28.060> going<00:02:28.329> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
deal because they know that I'm going to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.170 
deal because they know that I'm going to
put<00:02:28.689> up<00:02:28.870> work<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.069> read<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.939> they're

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
put up work that I can read so they're

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210 
put up work that I can read so they're
more<00:02:31.359> anxious<00:02:31.659> to<00:02:32.140> write<00:02:32.439> neatly<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.069> that

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
more anxious to write neatly so that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.759 
more anxious to write neatly so that
they<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.489> share<00:02:33.519> their<00:02:33.819> work<00:02:34.500> another<00:02:35.500> thing

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
they can share their work another thing

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.849 
they can share their work another thing
I<00:02:35.859> notice<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.760> math<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.510> expect<00:02:38.230> students<00:02:38.650> in

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
I notice is in math I expect students in

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.589 
I notice is in math I expect students in
third<00:02:39.010> grade<00:02:39.159> to<00:02:39.459> show<00:02:39.849> their<00:02:40.060> answers<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
third grade to show their answers and

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.530 
third grade to show their answers and
show<00:02:40.720> how<00:02:40.989> they<00:02:41.230> got<00:02:41.379> their<00:02:41.620> work<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.540> with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
the they know that I won't put their

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.289 
the they know that I won't put their
work<00:02:45.099> up<00:02:45.310> there<00:02:45.489> or<00:02:45.700> they<00:02:45.790> won't<00:02:45.909> be<00:02:46.090> able<00:02:46.150> to

work up there or they won't be able to
put<00:02:46.420> their<00:02:46.540> work<00:02:46.629> up<00:02:46.840> there<00:02:47.049> if<00:02:47.260> they<00:02:47.709> haven't

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
put their work up there if they haven't

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.699 
put their work up there if they haven't
shown<00:02:48.220> how<00:02:48.430> they<00:02:48.579> got<00:02:48.730> their<00:02:48.940> answer<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.709> they

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
shown how they got their answer and they

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.830 
shown how they got their answer and they
do<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:51.099> now<00:02:51.310> all<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.970> time<00:02:52.150> they<00:02:52.569> do<00:02:52.629> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
do that now all the time they do it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.599 
do that now all the time they do it
during<00:02:52.989> tests<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.590> other<00:02:53.709> times<00:02:54.040> where<00:02:54.310> their

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
during tests and other times where their

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.949 
during tests and other times where their
homework<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.269> times<00:02:55.540> when<00:02:55.690> they<00:02:55.810> would

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
homework and times when they would

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.240 
homework and times when they would
normally<00:02:56.109> share<00:02:56.530> their<00:02:56.709> work<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:57.129> because

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
normally share their work just because

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.280 
normally share their work just because
they've<00:02:57.579> gotten<00:02:58.329> into<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.659> routine<00:02:58.840> of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
they've gotten into that routine of

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.860 
they've gotten into that routine of
showing<00:02:59.709> no<00:03:00.129> speaking<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.849> students<00:03:01.389> has<00:03:01.659> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
showing no speaking of students has the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.069 
showing no speaking of students has the
classroom<00:03:02.409> participation<00:03:02.769> changed<00:03:03.700> at<00:03:03.819> all

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
classroom participation changed at all

on the big screen so I get a lot of

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.970 
on the big screen so I get a lot of
students<00:03:21.639> that<00:03:21.669> volunteering<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.949> like<00:03:23.949> a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
students that volunteering and like a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.439 
students that volunteering and like a
WOW<00:03:24.250> factor<00:03:24.480> yeah<00:03:25.480> exactly<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.970> how<00:03:28.150> have<00:03:28.299> you

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
WOW factor yeah exactly so how have you

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.360 
WOW factor yeah exactly so how have you
use<00:03:28.690> your<00:03:28.959> aver<00:03:29.199> vision<00:03:29.650> document<00:03:29.829> camera

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
use your aver vision document camera

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.920 
use your aver vision document camera
combined<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:30.909> other<00:03:31.030> forms<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.720> technology

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
in the classroom one of the things that

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.039 
in the classroom one of the things that
I<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.260> use<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.040> computer<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:37.049> make

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
I do is use the computer and make

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.629 
I do is use the computer and make
powerpoint<00:03:38.379> slide<00:03:38.799> shows<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.069> things<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.609> I

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
powerpoint slide shows the things that I

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.699 
powerpoint slide shows the things that I
want<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.000> students<00:03:40.389> to<00:03:40.449> take<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:41.019> look<00:03:41.199> at<00:03:41.440> and

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
want the students to take a look at and

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.770 
want the students to take a look at and
then<00:03:42.370> we'll<00:03:42.609> go<00:03:42.729> back<00:03:42.909> and<00:03:43.120> forth<00:03:43.269> between<00:03:43.510> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
then we'll go back and forth between the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.270 
then we'll go back and forth between the
working<00:03:44.049> document<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.650> document<00:03:45.129> camera

to<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:46.000> PowerPoint<00:03:46.479> and<00:03:46.810> we'll<00:03:47.109> look<00:03:47.889> at<00:03:48.010> that

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
to the PowerPoint and we'll look at that

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.949 
to the PowerPoint and we'll look at that
and<00:03:48.489> see<00:03:48.699> what<00:03:48.729> kind<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.090> text<00:03:49.449> features<00:03:49.750> were

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
and see what kind of text features were

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.500 
and see what kind of text features were

you absolutely love or you notice to use

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.909 
you absolutely love or you notice to use
on<00:04:06.159> a<00:04:06.190> daily<00:04:06.430> basis<00:04:07.500> one<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.650> things<00:04:08.709> I

on a daily basis one of the things I
really<00:04:08.949> liked<00:04:09.459> is<00:04:09.639> that<00:04:09.669> arm<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:11.199> can

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
really liked is that arm that you can

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.869 
really liked is that arm that you can
maneuver<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.979> mechanical<00:04:12.549> from<00:04:12.699> the

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
maneuver the mechanical from the

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.390 
maneuver the mechanical from the
mechanic<00:04:13.150> warm<00:04:13.540> for<00:04:14.019> example<00:04:14.379> I<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.799> it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
mechanic warm for example I like to it

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.659 
mechanic warm for example I like to it
show<00:04:15.970> chemical<00:04:16.570> change<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.229> used<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.220> do<00:04:18.340> I

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
show chemical change and used to do I

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.460 
show chemical change and used to do I
would<00:04:18.940> make<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> pancake<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.810> all<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.289> class

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
would make a pancake and all the class

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.350 
would make a pancake and all the class
would<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.889> gather<00:04:21.519> round<00:04:21.849> and<00:04:22.240> they

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
would have to gather round and they

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.480 
would have to gather round and they
couldn't<00:04:22.599> all<00:04:22.719> see<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.110> at<00:04:23.229> one<00:04:23.380> time<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:24.310> with

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
couldn't all see it at one time but with

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.370 
couldn't all see it at one time but with
the<00:04:24.610> document<00:04:25.060> camera<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.479> can<00:04:25.690> swing<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.080> arm

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the document camera I can swing that arm

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.870 
the document camera I can swing that arm
back<00:04:26.469> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
back and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.190 
back and
wouldn't<00:04:27.270> want<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.420> put<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.660> hot<00:04:27.780> plate<00:04:27.990> on

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
wouldn't want to put the hot plate on

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.080 
wouldn't want to put the hot plate on
the<00:04:28.350> camera<00:04:28.770> itself<00:04:28.860> but<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.610> can<00:04:29.820> swing<00:04:30.060> that

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
the camera itself but I can swing that

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.600 
the camera itself but I can swing that
arm<00:04:30.390> around<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.900> they<00:04:31.110> can<00:04:31.380> focus<00:04:31.980> on<00:04:32.280> that

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
arm around and they can focus on that

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.580 
arm around and they can focus on that
and<00:04:32.670> they'll<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.270> bubbles<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
and they'll see the bubbles as the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.190 
and they'll see the bubbles as the
chemical<00:04:35.400> reactions<00:04:35.850> are<00:04:36.060> occurring<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.840> can

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
chemical reactions are occurring I can

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.900 
chemical reactions are occurring I can
flip<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.500> pancake<00:04:37.860> over<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.430> they<00:04:38.490> see<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.760> as

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
flip the pancake over and they see it as

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.090 
flip the pancake over and they see it as
turn<00:04:39.120> brown<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.420> other<00:04:39.810> evidence<00:04:40.350> of
