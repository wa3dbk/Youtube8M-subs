it<00:02:25.830> does<00:02:26.129> not<00:02:26.310> pick<00:02:26.549> up<00:02:26.670> anyone<00:02:27.000> else<00:02:27.349> like<00:02:28.349> if

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.809 
which is running wireless as well you
can<00:02:36.000> see<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.690> picking<00:02:37.080> up<00:02:37.819> multiple

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
only taking up three of them so it's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.330 
only taking up three of them so it's
kind<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.730> disappointing<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:49.410> mean<00:02:50.099> other<00:02:50.250> than
