he might just go for the fake out which

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.810 
he might just go for the fake out which
is<00:01:05.019> why<00:01:05.229> I<00:01:05.259> protect<00:01:05.680> above<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.369> I<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.700> get

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
is why I protect above that I can get

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.240 
is why I protect above that I can get
the<00:01:06.970> six<00:01:07.270> percent<00:01:07.659> damage<00:01:07.810> with<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.799> hill<00:01:09.040> as

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
the six percent damage with the hill as

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.800 
the six percent damage with the hill as
he<00:01:09.579> just<00:01:09.790> ends<00:01:09.939> up<00:01:10.000> gun<00:01:10.210> for<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.600> term

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.179 
he just ends up gun for the you term
which<00:01:10.990> has<00:01:11.200> me<00:01:11.320> thinking<00:01:11.350> maybe<00:01:11.799> he<00:01:12.009> doesn't

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
which has me thinking maybe he doesn't

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.100 
which has me thinking maybe he doesn't
carry<00:01:12.579> all<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.390> fake<00:01:13.509> out<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:13.840> can<00:01:13.930> keep

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
carry all the fake out so I can keep

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.600 
carry all the fake out so I can keep
that<00:01:14.259> in<00:01:14.320> mind<00:01:14.500> for<00:01:14.680> later<00:01:14.710> on<00:01:15.040> in<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.280> battle

unfortunately<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.170> miss<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.040> fearing<00:01:39.400> the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
unfortunately I miss so fearing the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.950 
unfortunately I miss so fearing the
coast<00:01:39.760> combat<00:01:40.150> actually<00:01:40.450> switched<00:01:40.660> it<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.780> my

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
coast combat actually switched it to my

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.390 
coast combat actually switched it to my
Sableye<00:01:41.410> but<00:01:41.590> he<00:01:41.650> makes<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:42.010> very<00:01:42.280> good

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
Sableye but he makes a very good

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.220 
Sableye but he makes a very good
prediction<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.120> predicts<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.930> and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
prediction and predicts that and

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.290 
prediction and predicts that and
actually<00:01:44.350> goes<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:44.980> toxic<00:01:45.460> on<00:01:45.580> hindsight

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
actually goes for the toxic on hindsight

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually goes for the toxic on hindsight
maybe<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.720> actually<00:01:47.050> should<00:01:47.290> have<00:01:47.410> switched

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
maybe I actually should have switched

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.920 
maybe I actually should have switched
into<00:01:47.860> my<00:01:48.070> cool<00:01:48.400> fish<00:01:48.610> seeing<00:01:49.330> as<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.510> coulda<00:01:49.750> got

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
into my cool fish seeing as I coulda got

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.170 
into my cool fish seeing as I coulda got
up<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.140> free<00:01:50.380> layer<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.890> toxic<00:01:51.640> spikes<00:01:51.850> as<00:01:52.030> he

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
up a free layer of toxic spikes as he

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.880 
up a free layer of toxic spikes as he
did<00:01:52.390> switch<00:01:52.600> out<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.200> yeah<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.710> was<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.830> big

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
did switch out so yeah that was a big

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.290 
did switch out so yeah that was a big
dumb<00:01:54.190> on<00:01:54.280> my<00:01:54.310> part<00:01:54.430> which<00:01:55.030> means<00:01:55.240> the

dumb on my part which means the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.510 
dumb on my part which means the
survivability<00:01:55.720> on<00:01:56.140> my<00:01:56.530> sable<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.070> going<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.430> be

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
survivability on my sable is going to be

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.700 
survivability on my sable is going to be
limited<00:01:57.940> as<00:01:58.090> he<00:01:58.479> brings<00:01:58.690> in<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.050> register<00:01:59.500> I'm

going to go for the burn and the ton

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.080 
going to go for the burn and the ton
seeing<00:02:02.020> as<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.470> need<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.040> get<00:02:03.190> resile<00:02:03.520> damage<00:02:03.940> on

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
I can do with it with my Sableye which

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.090 
I can do with it with my Sableye which
is<00:02:10.300> why<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.660> actually<00:02:10.959> bring<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.530> my<00:02:11.680> Snover

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
is why I actually bring in my Snover

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.830 
is why I actually bring in my Snover
just<00:02:12.310> basically<00:02:12.670> as<00:02:12.820> deaf<00:02:13.030> father<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.570> he

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
just basically as deaf father and he

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.420 
just basically as deaf father and he
does<00:02:14.050> turn<00:02:14.230> out<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.739> iron<00:02:14.950> head<00:02:15.220> are

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
does turn out to have the iron head are

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.300 
does turn out to have the iron head are
the<00:02:16.030> last<00:02:16.780> two<00:02:17.080> registers<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:18.010> faced

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the last two registers that I have faced

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.350 
the last two registers that I have faced
have<00:02:18.550> actually<00:02:18.850> turned<00:02:19.030> out<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> have

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
have actually turned out to have

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.420 
have actually turned out to have
earthquake<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.470> why<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.800> was<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> bit

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
earthquake which is why I was a bit

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.650 
earthquake which is why I was a bit
surprised<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.850> he<00:02:21.910> was<00:02:22.090> carrying<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> iron

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
surprised that he was carrying the iron

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.510 
surprised that he was carrying the iron
head<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.050> now<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.860> get<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> free<00:02:24.190> switcher

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
head but now I can get a free switcher

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.220 
head but now I can get a free switcher
to<00:02:24.670> micro<00:02:24.970> fish<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.360> if<00:02:25.660> he<00:02:25.780> does<00:02:25.959> want<00:02:26.170> to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
to micro fish and if he does want to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.540 
to micro fish and if he does want to
stay<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.590> go<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.830> stealth<00:02:27.070> rocks<00:02:27.310> i'm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
stay in and go for the stealth rocks i'm

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.770 
stay in and go for the stealth rocks i'm
gonna<00:02:27.790> revealed<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.150> him<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.450> do<00:02:28.510> actually

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
gonna revealed to him that I do actually

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.140 
gonna revealed to him that I do actually
carry<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> time<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:30.310> instead<00:02:30.640> he<00:02:30.760> makes<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
carry the time but instead he makes the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.000 
carry the time but instead he makes the
safer<00:02:31.480> play<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> actually<00:02:32.350> switches<00:02:32.709> out<00:02:32.830> to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
safer play and actually switches out to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.370 
safer play and actually switches out to
the<00:02:33.100> umbreon<00:02:33.550> but<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:34.120> umbreon<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:35.200> do

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the umbreon but really umbreon can do

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.370 
the umbreon but really umbreon can do
nothing<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:36.250> micro<00:02:36.610> fish<00:02:36.820> but<00:02:37.420> holy<00:02:37.720> crap<00:02:38.140> that

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
nothing to micro fish but holy crap that

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.100 
nothing to micro fish but holy crap that
payback<00:02:38.739> did<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:39.640> too<00:02:39.670> much<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.900> what<00:02:41.080> I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
payback did way too much but what I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.360 
payback did way too much but what I
decided<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.590> do<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.830> actually<00:02:42.070> get<00:02:42.190> out<00:02:42.250> my

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
decided to do was actually get out my

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.310 
decided to do was actually get out my
first<00:02:42.610> letter<00:02:42.850> top<00:02:43.060> spikes<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.989> way<00:02:44.140> when

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
first letter top spikes so that way when

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.690 
first letter top spikes so that way when
he<00:02:44.410> switches<00:02:44.650> into<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> him<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.310> top<00:02:45.519> as<00:02:45.670> he

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
he switches into the him on top as he

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.550 
he switches into the him on top as he
did<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.090> turn<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.750> get<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.110> poison<00:02:47.290> off

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
did this turn I can get the poison off

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.920 
did this turn I can get the poison off
and<00:02:47.799> as<00:02:48.280> i<00:02:48.549> said<00:02:48.610> earlier<00:02:48.880> hail<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.660> going<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
and as i said earlier hail is going to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.630 
and as i said earlier hail is going to
be<00:02:50.019> nullifying<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.620> leftovers<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:51.430> means

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
be nullifying the leftovers which means

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.610 
be nullifying the leftovers which means
every<00:02:51.820> turn<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.750> M<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.049> top<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.350> going<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.530> be

every turn this M on top is going to be

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.620 
every turn this M on top is going to be
taking<00:02:53.920> twelve<00:02:54.160> percent<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.239> go<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.510> my

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
taking twelve percent so I can go for my

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.300 
taking twelve percent so I can go for my
large<00:02:55.959> spikes<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:56.590> switch<00:02:56.830> out<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.190> my

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
large spikes then switch out to my

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.310 
large spikes then switch out to my
stable<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.760> predicting<00:02:58.750> him<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> go<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.260> the

stable I predicting him to go for the

stable I predicting him to go for the
rapid<00:02:59.590> spin<00:02:59.830> but<00:03:00.010> instead<00:03:00.310> he<00:03:00.459> actually<00:03:00.610> ends

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
rapid spin but instead he actually ends

rapid spin but instead he actually ends
up<00:03:00.940> going<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.360> toxic<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:01.989> not<00:03:02.530> too<00:03:02.680> sure

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
up going for the toxic I'm not too sure

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.590 
up going for the toxic I'm not too sure
why<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.250> guess<00:03:03.549> maybe<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> misclick<00:03:04.420> or

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
why I guess maybe that was a misclick or

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.000 
why I guess maybe that was a misclick or
miss<00:03:04.780> play<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.260> he<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.560> carrying<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
miss play but if he was carrying the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.500 
miss play but if he was carrying the
stone<00:03:06.250> edge<00:03:06.430> then<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.120> would<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:07.360> been<00:03:07.420> his

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
stone edge then that would have been his

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.090 
stone edge then that would have been his
perfect<00:03:07.900> moment<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.350> for<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.680> seeing<00:03:08.890> as<00:03:09.040> I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
perfect moment to go for it seeing as I

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.580 
perfect moment to go for it seeing as I
switch<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.519> was<00:03:09.790> pretty<00:03:10.030> obvious<00:03:10.239> but<00:03:10.630> hey<00:03:11.140> not

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
switch I was pretty obvious but hey not

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.350 
switch I was pretty obvious but hey not
that<00:03:11.650> big<00:03:11.950> video<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.370> he<00:03:12.730> brings<00:03:12.940> back<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
that big video as he brings back in the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.780 
that big video as he brings back in the
register<00:03:13.750> he's<00:03:14.080> being<00:03:14.320> worn<00:03:14.890> down<00:03:15.100> by<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
register he's being worn down by the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.670

burn<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.480> hill<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:16.989> at<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.260> point<00:03:17.470> I'm

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
burn and the hill so at this point I'm

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.020 
burn and the hill so at this point I'm
thinking<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.459> basically<00:03:18.790> useless

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
thinking that it's basically useless

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.030 
thinking that it's basically useless
which<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.660> why<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.840> bring<00:03:20.079> in<00:03:20.230> my<00:03:20.320> title<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:20.920> it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
which is why I bring in my title but it

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.840 
which is why I bring in my title but it
has<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.519> rest<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.950> then<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.160> back<00:03:24.400> up<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.670> a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
has the rest and then it's back up to a

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.600 
has the rest and then it's back up to a
hundred<00:03:25.120> percent<00:03:25.560> ha

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.740

maybe<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.780> should<00:04:12.959> have<00:04:13.049> gone<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.409> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
maybe I should have gone for the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
maybe I should have gone for the
substitute<00:04:13.920> because<00:04:14.069> as<00:04:14.430> she<00:04:14.700> saw<00:04:14.849> that<00:04:14.879> he

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
substitute because as she saw that he

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.580 
substitute because as she saw that he
did<00:04:15.359> switch<00:04:15.540> out<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.930> if<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.079> did<00:04:16.260> go<00:04:16.380> for<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
did switch out and if I did go for the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.170 
did switch out and if I did go for the
sub<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.949> wouldn't<00:04:17.370> have<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.609> waste<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.940> one

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
sub I wouldn't have to waste this one

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.330 
sub I wouldn't have to waste this one
turn<00:04:18.389> where<00:04:18.900> he<00:04:19.019> is<00:04:19.139> forced<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> rest<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.070> go

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
but then again if he predicts me to

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.550 
but then again if he predicts me to
predict<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.510> sucker<00:05:12.870> punch<00:05:12.960> is<00:05:13.199> possible<00:05:13.500> to

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
predict the sucker punch is possible to

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.320 
predict the sucker punch is possible to
go<00:05:13.650> for<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.830> Nazi<00:05:14.159> plot<00:05:14.370> or<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.909> substitute

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
go for the Nazi plot or the substitute

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.000 
go for the Nazi plot or the substitute
they<00:05:15.449> can<00:05:15.599> go<00:05:15.750> for<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.110> rapid<00:05:16.349> spin<00:05:16.620> then<00:05:16.860> go

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
they can go for the rapid spin then go

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.800 
they can go for the rapid spin then go
for<00:05:17.190> yourself<00:05:17.460> which<00:05:17.580> means<00:05:17.789> my<00:05:18.180> hazards<00:05:18.630> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
for yourself which means my hazards and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.930 
for yourself which means my hazards and
myself<00:05:19.260> would<00:05:19.440> be<00:05:19.590> gone<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.490> I<00:05:20.520> thought<00:05:20.760> that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
myself would be gone so I thought that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.909 
myself would be gone so I thought that
the<00:05:21.030> blizzard<00:05:21.360> was<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.750> better<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.349> safe

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
the blizzard was the better and safe

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.500 
the blizzard was the better and safe
played<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.310> go<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.610> that<00:05:23.729> situation<00:05:24.060> as<00:05:24.479> it

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
played to go in that situation as it

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.570 
played to go in that situation as it
brings<00:05:24.750> in<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.050> ambipom<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.740> Abby<00:05:26.280> palm<00:05:26.460> has

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
brings in the ambipom and Abby palm has

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.570 
brings in the ambipom and Abby palm has
a<00:05:26.639> base<00:05:26.849> of<00:05:27.030> 115<00:05:27.539> speed<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.020> jinx<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.770> based<00:05:29.130> 95

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
a base of 115 speed and jinx is based 95

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.969 
a base of 115 speed and jinx is based 95
so<00:05:29.729> even<00:05:30.000> if<00:05:30.120> ambipom<00:05:30.389> was<00:05:30.720> adamant<00:05:31.349> it<00:05:31.530> would

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
so even if ambipom was adamant it would

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.100 
so even if ambipom was adamant it would
still<00:05:32.220> add<00:05:32.430> Spain<00:05:32.699> my<00:05:32.849> jinx<00:05:33.180> so<00:05:33.389> thinking<00:05:34.020> I

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
still add Spain my jinx so thinking I

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.570 
still add Spain my jinx so thinking I
might<00:05:34.260> have<00:05:34.440> some<00:05:34.620> news<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:34.800> jinx<00:05:35.159> later<00:05:35.370> on

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580

king<00:06:04.330> dru<00:06:04.450> is<00:06:04.660> viable<00:06:04.990> but<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.950> means<00:06:05.980> that

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
king dru is viable but that means that

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.490 
king dru is viable but that means that
he<00:06:06.790> must<00:06:06.940> have<00:06:07.090> given<00:06:07.240> up<00:06:07.510> dragon<00:06:08.290> pulse

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
he must have given up dragon pulse

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.320 
he must have given up dragon pulse
seeing<00:06:09.070> as<00:06:09.220> if<00:06:09.370> he<00:06:09.460> was<00:06:09.640> carrying<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.030> dragon

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
seeing as if he was carrying the dragon

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.430 
seeing as if he was carrying the dragon
pulse<00:06:10.450> that<00:06:10.630> would<00:06:10.750> have<00:06:10.840> been<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.020> best<00:06:11.260> move

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
pulse that would have been the best move

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.260 
pulse that would have been the best move
for<00:06:11.470> him<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:11.860> go<00:06:12.040> for<00:06:12.280> and<00:06:12.730> just<00:06:12.970> be<00:06:13.060> able<00:06:13.090> to

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
for him to go for and just be able to

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.090 
for him to go for and just be able to
hit<00:06:13.390> my<00:06:13.480> whole<00:06:13.630> team<00:06:13.900> for<00:06:14.140> neutral<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:14.950> it

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
hit my whole team for neutral and it

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.640 
hit my whole team for neutral and it
being<00:06:15.250> stabbed<00:06:15.670> so<00:06:16.330> yeah<00:06:17.080> I<00:06:17.110> guess<00:06:17.260> it<00:06:17.410> could

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
being stabbed so yeah I guess it could

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.960 
being stabbed so yeah I guess it could
help<00:06:17.800> in<00:06:17.980> certain<00:06:18.100> situations<00:06:18.340> but<00:06:18.760> in<00:06:18.880> this

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
help in certain situations but in this

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.250 
help in certain situations but in this
one<00:06:19.030> it's<00:06:19.360> really<00:06:19.630> not<00:06:19.750> going<00:06:19.930> to<00:06:19.990> be<00:06:20.080> too

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
one it's really not going to be too

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.170 
one it's really not going to be too
beneficial<00:06:20.740> to<00:06:20.800> him<00:06:20.890> as<00:06:21.190> he<00:06:21.550> finishes<00:06:22.060> off

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
beneficial to him as he finishes off

that isn't the case and I'm going to
force<00:06:53.890> the<00:06:54.010> hearts<00:06:54.280> which<00:06:54.460> directly<00:06:54.910> out<00:06:55.120> into

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
force the hearts which directly out into

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.360 
force the hearts which directly out into
my<00:06:55.570> stable<00:06:55.870> I<00:06:55.990> as<00:06:56.200> this<00:06:56.560> turn<00:06:56.740> I<00:06:56.830> can<00:06:56.890> go<00:06:57.130> for

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
my stable I as this turn I can go for

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.920 
my stable I as this turn I can go for
the<00:06:57.550> Willows<00:06:57.940> and<00:06:58.150> if<00:06:58.300> he<00:06:58.390> had<00:06:58.510> gone<00:06:58.660> for<00:06:58.870> the

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
the Willows and if he had gone for the

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.110 
the Willows and if he had gone for the
rest<00:06:59.170> and<00:06:59.380> that<00:06:59.950> situation<00:07:00.580> then<00:07:00.700> he<00:07:00.790> possibly

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
rest and that situation then he possibly

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.150 
rest and that situation then he possibly
could<00:07:01.570> have<00:07:01.630> won<00:07:01.900> like<00:07:02.410> before<00:07:02.710> me<00:07:02.830> I<00:07:02.860> guess<00:07:03.040> he

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
could have won like before me I guess he

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.650 
could have won like before me I guess he
predicted<00:07:03.580> that<00:07:03.640> and<00:07:03.910> actually<00:07:04.030> went<00:07:04.390> for<00:07:04.570> the

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
predicted that and actually went for the

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.360 
predicted that and actually went for the
iron<00:07:04.960> head<00:07:05.140> which<00:07:05.560> means<00:07:05.770> I<00:07:05.860> can<00:07:06.010> burn<00:07:06.190> them

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
iron head which means I can burn them

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.100 
iron head which means I can burn them
then<00:07:06.610> taunt<00:07:06.880> him<00:07:07.030> and<00:07:07.240> because<00:07:07.750> he<00:07:07.780> has<00:07:07.960> taken

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
then taunt him and because he has taken

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.020 
then taunt him and because he has taken
to<00:07:08.350> a<00:07:08.440> percent<00:07:08.770> and<00:07:08.920> he's<00:07:09.160> only<00:07:09.400> at<00:07:09.640> twenty-one
