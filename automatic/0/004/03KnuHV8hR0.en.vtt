00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
your data bills so again I'm going to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.630 
your data bills so again I'm going to
start<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.470> step<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.220> series

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
start with the first step in this series

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.910 
start with the first step in this series
and<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.510> thing<00:00:30.810> which<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and the first thing which you can do to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620 
and the first thing which you can do to
minimize<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.369> mobile<00:00:32.850> data<00:00:33.000> usage<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
minimize the mobile data usage is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.560 
minimize the mobile data usage is
through<00:00:34.410> Opera<00:00:34.890> Mini<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.969> romani

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
of compressing data so you can compress

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.330 
of compressing data so you can compress

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it can actually save a lot of data when

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
it can actually save a lot of data when
