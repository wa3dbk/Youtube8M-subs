that's a pull off 15 14 14 14 and then

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.060 
that's a pull off 15 14 14 14 and then
14<00:04:34.670> 14<00:04:35.960> easiest<00:04:36.960> way<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.320> roll<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.680> finger

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
14 14 easiest way just roll that finger

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.020 
14 14 easiest way just roll that finger
across<00:04:39.920> the<00:04:40.920> strings<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.310> strings<00:04:41.580> don't

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
across the strings the strings don't

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.260
