00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that this is just another more this add

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
that this is just another more this add
more<00:00:44.370> range<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.510> Daft<00:00:45.780> movements<00:00:46.289> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
more range to your Daft movements so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:06.840 
more range to your Daft movements so
let's<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.190> started

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.750 

to<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.970> side<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.420> looks<00:01:08.450> like<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:12.760> when

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
to the side it looks like this when

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.580 
to the side it looks like this when
you're<00:01:13.850> beginning<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:14.600> our<00:01:14.690> body<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.260> feel<00:01:15.500> a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
you're beginning in our body we feel a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.850 
you're beginning in our body we feel a
little<00:01:15.740> bit<00:01:15.890> stiff<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:17.300> practice

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
little bit stiff but just practice

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.330 
little bit stiff but just practice
rolling<00:01:18.860> your<00:01:19.010> hips

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
rolling your hips

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.090 
rolling your hips
and<00:01:19.490> at<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.240> end<00:01:20.510> of<00:01:20.720> each<00:01:20.990> weight<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.890> when

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
and at the end of each weight is when

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.050 
and at the end of each weight is when
you're<00:01:22.250> stuck

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.150 

this<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.720> basic<00:01:31.230> but<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.830> can<00:01:32.010> even

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
this is just the basic but you can even

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.120 
this is just the basic but you can even
like<00:01:32.430> start<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> broaden<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.230> range<00:01:34.440> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like start to broaden the range as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
like start to broaden the range as
you're<00:01:35.370> stepping<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> boat<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.130> go

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you're stepping out the boat you can go

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.580 
you're stepping out the boat you can go
from<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.930> left<00:01:43.340> right<00:01:45.410> just<00:01:46.410> by

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
from the right the left right just by

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:57.280 
from the right the left right just by
shifting<00:01:47.190> your<00:01:47.400> weight

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.960 

so<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.410> next<00:01:58.590> variation<00:01:59.190> looks<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.550> little<00:01:59.730> bit

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
so the next variation looks a little bit

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.420 
so the next variation looks a little bit
something<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:07.010> it<00:02:08.010> requires<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
something like this and it requires a

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.850 
something like this and it requires a
lot<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.670> hip<00:02:08.850> action<00:02:09.060> too<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:10.320> when<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.680> go<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
lot of hip action too so when you go to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:03:14.710 
lot of hip action too so when you go to
the<00:02:11.040> left<00:02:23.750> once<00:02:24.750> you

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.080 

there's<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.620> bit<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.250> between<00:03:16.280> points

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
there's a bit of it in between points

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.570 
there's a bit of it in between points
when<00:03:17.540> you're<00:03:17.780> changing<00:03:18.320> your<00:03:18.980> weight

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.140 

and<00:03:28.690> once<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.960> once<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:30.920> start<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.400> feel<00:03:31.880> out

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
and once you once you start to feel out

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.000 
and once you once you start to feel out
there<00:03:32.390> feel<00:03:33.020> out<00:03:33.230> their<00:03:33.410> foot<00:03:33.590> working<00:03:33.950> you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
there feel out their foot working you

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.680 
there feel out their foot working you
give<00:03:34.160> me<00:03:34.280> your<00:03:34.730> eyes<00:03:34.850> you're<00:03:35.300> gonna<00:03:35.420> be<00:03:35.600> able
