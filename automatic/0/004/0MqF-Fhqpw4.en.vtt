00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
into the tips tip 1 you can use your

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
into the tips tip 1 you can use your
torch<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> continuous<00:00:41.520> fill<00:00:41.820> light<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
torch as a continuous fill light so you

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
torch as a continuous fill light so you
can<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> shadow<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:43.920> been<00:00:44.129> cast

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
can see the shadow that's been cast

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729 
can see the shadow that's been cast
there<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> left<00:00:45.660> turning<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.590> the

there from right to left turning on the
flash<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.610> does<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> fairly<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.390> job<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
flash it does a fairly good job of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.500

filling in the the shadows in darker

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
filling in the the shadows in darker
situations<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> wouldn't<00:00:52.680> want<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:52.920> this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
situations you wouldn't want to use this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
situations you wouldn't want to use this
in<00:00:53.489> direct<00:00:53.820> sunlight<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.239> keep<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.719> mind<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
in direct sunlight and keep in mind it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
in direct sunlight and keep in mind it
is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> weak<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> small<00:00:56.280> light<00:00:56.699> source<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.210> it's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
is a weak and small light source so it's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
is a weak and small light source so it's
gonna<00:00:57.420> give<00:00:57.629> hard<00:00:57.870> shadows<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.190> kind

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
gonna give hard shadows but also be kind

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.330 
gonna give hard shadows but also be kind
of<00:00:59.489> ineffective<00:00:59.940> let's<00:01:00.629> use<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> indoors<00:01:01.379> tip

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340

on bright sunny days that's just without
any<00:01:22.770> polarizer<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.909> they're<00:01:24.150> adding<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
polarizing you can see the difference

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
polarizing you can see the difference

that it's making he's the first test
shot<00:01:28.619> using<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> polarizer<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> need<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
shot using the polarizer but you need to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
shot using the polarizer but you need to
rotate<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> best<00:01:32.070> effect

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
rotate them to get the best effect

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
rotate them to get the best effect
that's<00:01:32.790> why<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.060> called<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.299> circular

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that's why it's called a circular

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.440 
that's why it's called a circular
polarizer<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.549> maximum<00:01:36.119> effect

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.670 
polarizer there we go at maximum effect
you<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.689> he<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.110> making<00:01:37.439> the

colors punch now there we go that's the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
colors punch now there we go that's the
glasses<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:40.860> putting<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.880> can

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
glasses and then putting that on you can

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.149 
glasses and then putting that on you can
see<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> has<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> similar<00:01:42.810> effect<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.649> minor
