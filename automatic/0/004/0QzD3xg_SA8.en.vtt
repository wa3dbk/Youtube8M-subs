different<00:01:11.970> times<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.960> very<00:01:13.080> hard<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> make

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
different times it's very hard to make

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
different times it's very hard to make
one<00:01:14.070> tweet<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> difference<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
one tweet make a difference you have to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
one tweet make a difference you have to
spread<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.320> throughout<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> day<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.490> this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
spread it out throughout the day so this

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
spread it out throughout the day so this
would<00:01:17.790> hopefully<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.659> Twitter<00:01:19.140> followers

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
would hopefully get Twitter followers

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280 
would hopefully get Twitter followers
over<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.520> subscribe<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.540> still<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
over to you to to subscribe but still it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.109 
over to you to to subscribe but still it
might<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:23.100> difficult<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.790> them<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> do

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
might be difficult to get them to do

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
might be difficult to get them to do
that<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:25.020> watch<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that because they can actually watch it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.620 
that because they can actually watch it
within<00:01:25.619> twitter.com<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.420> need

within twitter.com so you really do need

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
within twitter.com so you really do need
