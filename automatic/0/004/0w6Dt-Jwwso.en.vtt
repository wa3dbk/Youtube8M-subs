00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.690 
actually loop it through and then pull
it<00:06:43.520> back<00:06:43.820> through<00:06:44.150> like<00:06:44.360> so

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.790 

and<00:06:48.090> then<00:06:48.420> you<00:06:48.540> can<00:06:48.660> add<00:06:48.870> speeds<00:06:49.560> to<00:06:49.890> it<00:06:50.040> or<00:06:51.800> you

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
and then you can add speeds to it or you

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:01.400 
and then you can add speeds to it or you
can<00:06:53.040> add<00:06:55.100> take<00:06:56.100> some<00:06:56.640> a<00:06:57.710> jury<00:06:59.720> line<00:07:00.720> and<00:07:01.080> just

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
can add take some a jury line and just

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:10.370 
can add take some a jury line and just
add<00:07:01.650> some<00:07:01.680> beads<00:07:02.130> tie<00:07:02.820> it<00:07:02.880> together<00:07:07.760> and<00:07:09.380> you

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
add some beads tie it together and you

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.300 
add some beads tie it together and you
can<00:07:10.560> add<00:07:10.740> it<00:07:10.920> through<00:07:12.500> you<00:07:13.500> can<00:07:13.650> add<00:07:13.830> your<00:07:14.010> line

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
can add it through you can add your line

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.960 
can add it through you can add your line
through<00:07:14.610> the<00:07:14.730> beat<00:07:14.940> like<00:07:15.210> I<00:07:15.510> did<00:07:15.690> right<00:07:15.900> here

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:16.970 
through the beat like I did right here

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.120 
through the beat like I did right here
it's<00:07:17.970> that<00:07:18.330> simple<00:07:18.660> now<00:07:19.080> a<00:07:19.380> couple<00:07:19.710> of<00:07:19.980> days

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
it's that simple now a couple of days

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.540 
it's that simple now a couple of days
have<00:07:20.490> a<00:07:21.320> glaze<00:07:22.320> or<00:07:22.590> gloss<00:07:22.860> on<00:07:23.160> it<00:07:23.280> you<00:07:23.400> could

have a glaze or gloss on it you could

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.120 
have a glaze or gloss on it you could
use<00:07:23.760> the<00:07:24.000> 3d<00:07:24.300> of<00:07:27.320> gloss<00:07:28.320> that<00:07:28.350> we<00:07:28.740> usually<00:07:28.920> use

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130
