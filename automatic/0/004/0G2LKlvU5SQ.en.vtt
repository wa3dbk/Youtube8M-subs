00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
 although the mayor of Aguadilla Carlos 

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:06.319
 méndez martínez assured in an interview 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.360
 that there was already an agreement between the 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.090
 fishermen of the neighborhood and wei of his 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.880
 municipality and its person the fishermen 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.710
 they assure that this is not so at least 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.420
 this way the president let it know 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.150
 of the federation of fishermen of this 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.910
 area who explained that the mayor only 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.740
 seeks to snatch his fishmonger 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.230
 nine months is not used because 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.990
 supposedly the municipality has not 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.650
 granted the use permit in contract 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.320
 tape every day says that this building does not 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.870
 you can touch you have the consent 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.399
 of the agriculture department that passes 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.230
 that the agriculture department has 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.950
 to count on me because I'm 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.390
 paying nine months ago this building and 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.399
 we could not see it because it does not give us 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.250
 the use permit we have to 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.020
 firefighter and the health permit use and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.969
 is that according to vadillo méndez martínez 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.370
 has plans to demolish the fish market 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.790
 that has been established for 48 years 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.710
 to build a building he says that 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.540
 these and he wants to destroy the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.520
 three-story plot 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.150
 others will be since there are two taurian axes 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.670
 is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.220
 then I ask myself and how about who 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 let's pass a gesture from above but 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.270
 that's not all , the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 construction of the new promenade on the coast 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.560
 and the ramp that previously used 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.450
 fishermen and now they will not have easy 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.450
 access by the coral bell 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.680
 they rented to a man who caught 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.079
 the uncle cup that Paul paid and that's 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.170
 illegal understand me because this is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.360
 made with east fund of the municipality but 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 with state funds that gave the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 governor luis fortuño six million and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.229
 Fortuño middleweights six million 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 audio medium is the mayor 's office is so 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.009
 Vadillo assured that they will not stay 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
 arms crossed because if you do not get to 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.720
 an agreement as soon as possible will take 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.720
 the decision to sue the municipality
