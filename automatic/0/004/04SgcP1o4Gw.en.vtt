00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
modern ones that they're kind of broken

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.050 
modern ones that they're kind of broken
and<00:00:27.590> designed<00:00:28.590> around<00:00:28.800> not<00:00:29.340> being<00:00:29.369> fun

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and designed around not being fun

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759

jump scared and this and that in saying

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
jump scared and this and that in saying
that<00:00:38.100> taking<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.059> personal<00:00:39.809> opinions<00:00:40.170> out

that taking all my personal opinions out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.139 
that taking all my personal opinions out
of<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:41.129> makes<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> good<00:00:41.520> horror<00:00:41.760> game<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
of it what makes a good horror game I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.270 
of it what makes a good horror game I
think<00:00:42.510> part<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.379> need<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
think part of it is you need to be

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
think part of it is you need to be
powerless<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.329> can't<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
powerless you can't have some way of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.170 
powerless you can't have some way of
fighting<00:00:46.890> back<00:00:47.219> because<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
fighting back because then you get a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 
fighting back because then you get a
dead<00:00:48.329> space<00:00:48.570> situation<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.379> love<00:00:49.829> there's<00:00:50.039> all

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that when I think about dead space I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
think about the different guns the
different<00:01:06.840> upgrades<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.650> strong<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.250> am<00:01:08.400> the

train thing and whatnot
I<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> scariness

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I don't think about all the scariness

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490 
I don't think about all the scariness
because<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.880> fair<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> first<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
because to be fair the first one is a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
because to be fair the first one is a
full-on<00:01:17.009> survival<00:01:17.310> horror<00:01:17.790> game<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
full-on survival horror game but you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
full-on survival horror game but you
still<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> power<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
still do have the power there it was a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
still do have the power there it was a
nice<00:01:20.100> balance<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:20.790> did<00:01:20.970> start<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> go

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
nice balance and they did start to go

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
nice balance and they did start to go
way<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:21.900> towards<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> action<00:01:22.799> route<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
way more towards the action route in the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
way more towards the action route in the
in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> previous<00:01:23.909> ones<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.630> general<00:01:25.350> I've

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
in the previous ones but in general I've

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460 
in the previous ones but in general I've
played<00:01:26.280> some<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.270> amnesia<00:01:27.600> thought<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> was

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.480 
me so when I got to the scares it was
like<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.340> all

like it is that it really is that all

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
like it is that it really is that all
you're<00:01:56.700> gonna<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.689> move<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you're gonna do here then move on to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.889 
you're gonna do here then move on to
something<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.469> slender<00:01:58.979> slender<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.090> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
something like slender slender is is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
something like slender slender is is
fine<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.250> effective<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.210> what

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
fine it's it's very effective for what

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.749 
fine it's it's very effective for what
it<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.600> free<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.380> download<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.460> think

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it is a free little download and I think

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
it is a free little download and I think
as<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.810> horror<00:02:07.079> game<00:02:07.140> goes<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.099> pretty

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
as a horror game goes that is pretty

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.639 
as a horror game goes that is pretty
much<00:02:08.489> perfect<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.090> needs<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:10.319> like

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
much perfect it needs to be I don't like

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.410 
much perfect it needs to be I don't like
it<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.340> spread<00:02:12.239> themselves

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it when they they just spread themselves

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
it when they they just spread themselves
too<00:02:12.780> thin<00:02:12.959> like

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
too thin like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.229 
too thin like
this<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.220> slender<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> arrival<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
this like slender the arrival and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.149 
this like slender the arrival and
whatnot<00:02:15.569> they're<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.379> frustrating<00:02:16.920> after<00:02:17.129> a

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
whatnot they're just frustrating after a

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.770 
whatnot they're just frustrating after a
while<00:02:17.250> because<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> same<00:02:18.000> thing<00:02:18.299> they

you<00:04:39.350> learn<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.770> AI<00:04:39.950> pattern<00:04:40.460> once<00:04:40.670> you<00:04:40.820> learn

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
you learn the AI pattern once you learn

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.210 
you learn the AI pattern once you learn
how<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.240> sort<00:04:41.570> of<00:04:41.690> run<00:04:41.870> around<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.620> creatures

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
how to sort of run around the creatures

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.590 
how to sort of run around the creatures
to<00:04:43.310> chase<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:44.090> defeats<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.420> purpose

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
to chase you it defeats the purpose

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.210 
to chase you it defeats the purpose
again<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.170> doesn't<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.560> makes<00:04:45.740> once<00:04:46.100> you

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
again it doesn't it makes once you

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.950 
again it doesn't it makes once you
defeat<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.730> game<00:04:46.910> then<00:04:47.480> doesn't<00:04:47.780> become

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
defeat the game then doesn't become

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.780 
defeat the game then doesn't become
scary<00:04:48.260> anymore<00:04:48.590> there's<00:04:48.980> yet<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.250> be<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.490> horror

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
scary anymore there's yet to be a horror

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.240 
scary anymore there's yet to be a horror
game<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.270> really<00:04:50.780> does<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.650> mean<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:52.010> is<00:04:52.160> as

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
game that really does I mean this is as

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.210 
game that really does I mean this is as
far<00:04:52.490> as<00:04:52.520> I've<00:04:52.880> seen<00:04:52.910> in<00:04:53.630> my<00:04:54.290> limited

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
far as I've seen in my limited

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.920 
far as I've seen in my limited
admittedly<00:04:55.880> knowledge<00:04:56.360> of<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.660> horror<00:04:56.870> genre

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
admittedly knowledge of the horror genre

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.140 
admittedly knowledge of the horror genre
and<00:04:57.470> there's<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.070> reason<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.430> don't<00:04:58.490> like<00:04:58.640> it<00:04:58.970> if

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
and there's a reason I don't like it if

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.270 
and there's a reason I don't like it if
the<00:04:59.810> if<00:04:59.990> good<00:05:00.260> games<00:05:00.530> were<00:05:00.680> coming<00:05:00.920> out<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.070> it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
the if good games were coming out of it

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.850 
the if good games were coming out of it
if<00:05:01.370> these<00:05:01.880> immersive<00:05:02.630> experiences<00:05:03.230> which<00:05:03.650> I

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
if these immersive experiences which I

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.890 
if these immersive experiences which I
do<00:05:03.920> think<00:05:04.070> are<00:05:04.580> worth<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:05.060> were<00:05:05.600> being

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
do think are worth it were being

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.960 
do think are worth it were being
released<00:05:06.110> then<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:07.280> would<00:05:07.490> be<00:05:07.580> playing<00:05:07.760> them

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
released then I would be playing them

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.340 
released then I would be playing them
and<00:05:08.090> I'd<00:05:08.210> have<00:05:08.330> nothing<00:05:08.450> against<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.080> horror

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
and I'd have nothing against the horror

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.290 
and I'd have nothing against the horror
genre<00:05:09.440> but<00:05:10.070> it's<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.280> same<00:05:10.460> with<00:05:10.610> movies<00:05:10.970> like

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
genre but it's the same with movies like

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.240 
genre but it's the same with movies like
there's<00:05:11.900> there<00:05:12.290> were<00:05:12.350> just<00:05:12.500> no<00:05:12.740> good<00:05:13.010> horror

being<00:06:03.770> scared<00:06:04.130> is<00:06:04.250> a<00:06:04.310> unique<00:06:04.610> thing<00:06:04.850> that

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
being scared is a unique thing that

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.210 
being scared is a unique thing that
people<00:06:05.180> are<00:06:05.360> always<00:06:05.660> searching<00:06:05.870> for<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.470> for

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
people are always searching for and for

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.740 
people are always searching for and for
that<00:06:07.340> reason<00:06:07.700> I<00:06:07.790> think<00:06:08.030> people<00:06:08.300> are<00:06:08.480> a<00:06:08.510> little

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
that reason I think people are a little

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.230 
that reason I think people are a little
more<00:06:09.050> forgiving<00:06:10.040> with<00:06:10.430> horror<00:06:10.670> games<00:06:10.970> and

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
more forgiving with horror games and

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.390 
more forgiving with horror games and
just<00:06:11.270> in<00:06:11.510> general<00:06:11.900> but<00:06:12.140> I<00:06:12.200> think<00:06:12.560> someone

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
just in general but I think someone

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.190 
just in general but I think someone
really<00:06:13.640> needs<00:06:13.790> to<00:06:13.910> some<00:06:14.660> company<00:06:14.990> really

a world and it could be that could be

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.400 
a world and it could be that could be
very<00:06:31.940> effective<00:06:32.510> if<00:06:32.660> someone<00:06:32.960> managed<00:06:33.140> to<00:06:33.230> do

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
very effective if someone managed to do
