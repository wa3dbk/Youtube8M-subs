00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
so any you um I built this guy yesterday

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.680 
so any you um I built this guy yesterday
started<00:01:02.179> it<00:01:02.300> like<00:01:02.420> 10<00:01:02.690> ended<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.289> like<00:01:04.690> three

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
started it like 10 ended it like three

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.719 
started it like 10 ended it like three
so<00:01:06.350> that's<00:01:06.470> only<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:06.950> five<00:01:07.159> hours<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.670> then

I spent some hours today he kind of
sounds<00:01:10.549> like<00:01:10.700> Kermit<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.030> Frog<00:01:12.700> whatever<00:01:13.700> I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
sounds like Kermit the Frog whatever I

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.649 
sounds like Kermit the Frog whatever I
make<00:01:15.320> smart<00:01:16.100> puppet<00:01:16.520> I'll<00:01:17.180> kind<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.450> show<00:01:17.509> you

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
make smart puppet I'll kind of show you

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.260 
make smart puppet I'll kind of show you
how<00:01:17.840> he's<00:01:17.990> built<00:01:18.310> he<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.430> one<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.820> kind<00:01:19.850> I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
how he's built he is one of a kind I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.060 
how he's built he is one of a kind I
have<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:20.689> seen<00:01:20.990> anything<00:01:21.560> like<00:01:21.590> him<00:01:21.860> on

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
have not seen anything like him on

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.840 
have not seen anything like him on
YouTube<00:01:22.430> Europe<00:01:22.820> or<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.119> card<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:25.369> I'm<00:01:25.700> also

lipless videos pretty funny um so I'll

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.289 
lipless videos pretty funny um so I'll
kind<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.799> show<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:33.979> how<00:01:34.039> he<00:01:34.159> works<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.549> here

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
kind of show you how he works and here

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:49.779 
kind of show you how he works and here
we<00:01:35.390> go<00:01:35.509> No<00:01:41.829> whoo<00:01:44.380> okay<00:01:45.380> stop<00:01:45.740> oh<00:01:45.950> sorry<00:01:48.789> right

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
we go No whoo okay stop oh sorry right

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.999 
we go No whoo okay stop oh sorry right
so<00:01:50.030> pretty<00:01:50.780> much<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:51.200> have<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.590> shirt<00:01:51.859> on

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
so pretty much I just have a shirt on

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.060 
so pretty much I just have a shirt on
him<00:01:52.600> no<00:01:53.600> extra<00:01:53.840> padding<00:01:54.140> pretty<00:01:54.530> basic<00:01:54.649> all

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
him no extra padding pretty basic all

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.480 
him no extra padding pretty basic all
Lego<00:01:55.670> all<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.509> Lego<00:01:56.719> um<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.740> here<00:01:58.280> is

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
Lego all of it is Lego um so in here is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.440 
Lego all of it is Lego um so in here is
the<00:01:59.179> eyes<00:01:59.450> how<00:02:00.079> they<00:02:00.200> move<00:02:01.000> alright<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.359> I've

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
the eyes how they move alright so I've

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.149 
the eyes how they move alright so I've
got<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.689> little<00:02:03.049> uh<00:02:03.170> I'll<00:02:03.740> kind<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:03.950> show<00:02:04.039> you

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
got this little uh I'll kind of show you

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.609 
got this little uh I'll kind of show you
this<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.549> all<00:02:04.850> based<00:02:05.450> upon<00:02:05.719> actual

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
this is all based upon actual

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.460 
this is all based upon actual
ventriloquist<00:02:07.399> dummy<00:02:07.670> mechanics<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.509> look

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
ventriloquist dummy mechanics I look

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.980 
ventriloquist dummy mechanics I look
like<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.860> picture<00:02:10.100> online<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.550> stuff<00:02:10.700> mm-hmm

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
like a picture online and stuff mm-hmm

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.700 
like a picture online and stuff mm-hmm
alright<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.480> knob<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.590> you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
alright so this is the knob that you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.760 
alright so this is the knob that you
move<00:02:15.860> back<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.250> forth<00:02:16.460> to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
move back and forth to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.060 
move back and forth to
the<00:02:16.920> eyes<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.420> lever<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.470> move

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the eyes then this is the lever to move

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.980 
the eyes then this is the lever to move
the<00:02:20.190> mouse<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.760> down<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:21.450> hello

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the mouse up and down like this hello

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.540 
the mouse up and down like this hello
hello<00:02:22.620> everyone<00:02:23.160> oh<00:02:25.280> okay

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
hello everyone oh okay

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.120 
hello everyone oh okay
and<00:02:26.810> then<00:02:27.810> inside<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.530> kind<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.800> see<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and then inside you can kind of see the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.040 
and then inside you can kind of see the
mechanics<00:02:29.550> how<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.730> works<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.300> for<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.870> eyes

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
mechanics how it works here for the eyes

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.200 
mechanics how it works here for the eyes
and<00:02:31.080> try<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> gotta<00:02:33.150> just

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
and try to do this here so I gotta just

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.050 
and try to do this here so I gotta just
moves<00:02:33.480> back<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.840> forth<00:02:33.990> like<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.940> look<00:02:35.940> like

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
moves back and forth like that look like

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.470 
moves back and forth like that look like
angled<00:02:36.510> pieces<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> mouth<00:02:38.070> um

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
angled pieces and then for the mouth um

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.140 
angled pieces and then for the mouth um
can't<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.050> have<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.470> piece

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
