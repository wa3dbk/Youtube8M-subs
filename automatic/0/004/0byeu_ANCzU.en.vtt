messing<00:00:43.530> around<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.860> i<00:00:43.980> guess<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
messing around with i guess like the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.770 
messing around with i guess like the
movement<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> stuff<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
feels pretty fluid so you can see that i

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
feels pretty fluid so you can see that i
can<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.399> some<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.960> short<00:00:51.960> hop<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.410> air<00:00:52.649> to

something going on with the buffering

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
something going on with the buffering
here<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.549> need<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> figure<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.509> order

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
here that we need to figure out in order

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.880 
here that we need to figure out in order
to<00:01:51.990> uh<00:01:52.549> maybe<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.420> summer<00:01:54.960> combos<00:01:55.860> going

cancels from a from brawl at least what

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
cancels from a from brawl at least what
the<00:02:03.329> forward<00:02:03.659> air<00:02:03.750> he<00:02:03.840> does<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the forward air he does you can get a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
the forward air he does you can get a
folder<00:02:05.280> off<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.759> immediately<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:06.420> jabs

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
folder off and immediately go into jabs

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.470 
folder off and immediately go into jabs
or<00:02:07.649> even<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.099> into<00:02:08.250> Sheol<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:09.209> yeah

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.180 

well<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.840> down<00:02:13.080> air<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.530> guess<00:02:13.740> needs<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.070> little

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
well the down air I guess needs a little

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.360 
well the down air I guess needs a little
