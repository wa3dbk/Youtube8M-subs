to<00:03:14.100> its<00:03:14.310> playability<00:03:14.700> if<00:03:15.150> you're<00:03:15.420> familiar

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
to its playability if you're familiar

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.300

with<00:03:15.810> ten<00:03:16.110> or<00:03:16.200> twelve<00:03:16.440> full<00:03:16.590> operators<00:03:17.100> then

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
with ten or twelve full operators then

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.949 
with ten or twelve full operators then
it<00:03:17.550> won't<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.790> much<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.150> stretch<00:03:18.390> because<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it won't be much of a stretch because it

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.570 
it won't be much of a stretch because it
uses<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.230> very<00:03:19.530> similar<00:03:19.800> linear<00:03:20.310> finger

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
uses a very similar linear finger

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.340 
uses a very similar linear finger
pattern<00:03:20.910> what's<00:03:21.390> also<00:03:21.540> cool<00:03:21.780> about<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.170> in

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
pattern what's also cool about this in

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.020 
pattern what's also cool about this in
line<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.340> use<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> same<00:03:23.790> amount

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
line is that you can use the same amount

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.430 
line is that you can use the same amount
of<00:03:24.090> breath<00:03:24.269> pressure<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> low<00:03:24.989> notes<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
of breath pressure on the low notes to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.259 
of breath pressure on the low notes to
also<00:03:25.739> play<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.010> high<00:03:26.160> notes<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.910> may<00:03:27.090> take

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
also play the high notes it may take

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.060 
also play the high notes it may take
some<00:03:27.420> getting<00:03:27.660> used<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.959> however<00:03:28.320> because<00:03:28.800> I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
some getting used to however because I

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.920 
some getting used to however because I
found<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.489> very<00:03:29.610> sensitive<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.420> I've

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
found it to be very sensitive and I've

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.540 
found it to be very sensitive and I've
had<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.200> practice<00:03:31.530> staying<00:03:31.739> within<00:03:31.950> pitch<00:03:32.280> I

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
had to practice staying within pitch I

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.640 
had to practice staying within pitch I
think<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.630> best<00:03:33.780> qualities<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.440> ocarina
