00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.710
 for this craft you are going to occupy 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 little varnish or paint scissors 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.770
 acrylic and you can use plasticine but 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.620
 I will use flexible pasta 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.170
 cut your straws about 3 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.070
 centimeters and good is going to be cut out 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.989
 about 3 or 4 straws now you're going to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.650
 cut each straw as you are watching 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.650
 in the video 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.850
 now let's give it the shape of the center 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.470
 of the flower with either plasticine or 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 with the flexible dough 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.400
 and well now we are going to go burying the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.150
 potes and we will give shape to 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.150
 our flower 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 and good as I am working with 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.610
 pasta let it dry for a night do not 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 dried very well but with enough 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.619
 Now I'm going to put some varnish 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.259
 of glitters in the center of the flower and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.940
 well I'll let it dry completely 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.530
 now if you worked with plasticine 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.210
 there is no need to put the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.039
 varnish so that the plasticine then 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.039
 have the color and let it dry 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.430
 and that's how our flower looks 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.620
 potes the truth is that you can give 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 very much its use you can put it as 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.120
 decoration of a wall like that with a color 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.280
 strong so that the white is just what 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.710
 you can do for centerpieces you can 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.440
 be to decorate a party in order 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
