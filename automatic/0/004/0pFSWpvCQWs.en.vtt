ehlers-danlos syndrome it's a major
thing<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.610> attracted<00:00:12.480> me<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:13.110> was<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
thing that attracted me here was it's a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.220 
thing that attracted me here was it's a
special<00:00:14.190> place<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> lot<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> surgeries

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
special place and a lot of the surgeries

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.410 
special place and a lot of the surgeries
and<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.590> lot<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> procedures<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.210> are

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and a lot of the procedures that are

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.660 
and a lot of the procedures that are
done<00:00:18.570> routinely<00:00:19.109> around<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> world<00:00:20.130> for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
done routinely around the world for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
done routinely around the world for
congenital<00:00:21.330> heart<00:00:21.480> defects<00:00:21.930> started<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.070> or

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
congenital heart defects started here or

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.429 
congenital heart defects started here or
have<00:00:23.490> been<00:00:23.670> done<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.449> long<00:00:24.720> time<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
have been done here for a long time and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.849 
have been done here for a long time and
so<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.449> major<00:00:27.660> advantage<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
so that is one major advantage here is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040 
so that is one major advantage here is
that<00:00:29.130> even<00:00:29.670> though<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.359> different

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that even though all these different

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.880 
that even though all these different
defects<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:32.030> rare<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> lot

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
defects are rare we do get to see a lot

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.490 
defects are rare we do get to see a lot
of<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.880> overall<00:00:36.510> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
of them and I think overall that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.000 
of them and I think overall that
combined<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.360> expertise<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
combined with the expertise and kind of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.729 
combined with the expertise and kind of
this<00:00:41.129> team<00:00:41.430> approach<00:00:42.020> leads<00:00:43.020> overall<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
this team approach leads overall to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.729 
this team approach leads overall to
better<00:00:43.950> care<00:00:44.450> my<00:00:45.450> name<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.780> Diego<00:00:46.110> poorest<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
better care my name is Diego poorest and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.020 
better care my name is Diego poorest and
I'm<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.309> interventional

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I'm one of the interventional

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
I'm one of the interventional
cardiologists<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.170> Boston<00:00:49.500> Children's

cardiologists here at Boston Children's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.090 
cardiologists here at Boston Children's
Hospital<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.660> did<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.739> access

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Hospital so what we did we got access

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.560 
Hospital so what we did we got access
from<00:00:53.250> both<00:00:53.460> sides<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.850> didn't<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.180> kissing

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
from both sides and didn't like kissing

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.830 
from both sides and didn't like kissing
balloons<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:56.100> try<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.629> die<00:00:57.809> like

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
balloons to try to not just die like

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.750 
balloons to try to not just die like
both<00:00:58.199> stents<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.739> also<00:00:58.859> dialing<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.520> Aires

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
both stents but also dialing this Aires

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.130 
both stents but also dialing this Aires
where<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.300> gets<00:01:00.510> their<00:01:01.379> own<00:01:03.140> my

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
where it really gets their own my

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
where it really gets their own my
favorite<00:01:04.559> days<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.920> days<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.369> cathing

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
favorite days are days I'm cathing

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.149 
favorite days are days I'm cathing
because<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> day<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.010> what

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
because that's the day I get to do what

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
because that's the day I get to do what
I<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> data

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I like to do and also that's the data

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
I like to do and also that's the data
and<00:01:10.710> most<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.250> interact<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.939> families<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and most in interact with families and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.160 
and most in interact with families and

our<00:01:14.159> approach<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.729> mostly<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.509> try<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
our approach is mostly to try to have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
our approach is mostly to try to have
the<00:01:16.830> best<00:01:17.119> anatomical<00:01:18.119> setup<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:18.689> the

the best anatomical setup for the

the best anatomical setup for the
patient<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.189> earlier<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
patient and the earlier we can get to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
patient and the earlier we can get to
that<00:01:21.750> kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.350> ideal<00:01:22.740> setup<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.430> better

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that kind of ideal setup the better

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
that kind of ideal setup the better
experience<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.740> Yogi's<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.930> control

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
of the team from as soon as cumbersome

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.660 
of the team from as soon as cumbersome
because<00:01:30.540> we've<00:01:31.079> seen<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.740> interventional

because we've seen the interventional

change<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.790> over<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.119> last<00:01:36.299> 30<00:01:36.689> years<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
change a lot over the last 30 years it's

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.649 
change a lot over the last 30 years it's
been<00:01:37.560> revolutionized<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.700> there's<00:01:39.240> still<00:01:39.600> a

lot of change to come and hopefully

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.280 
lot of change to come and hopefully
that'll<00:01:42.240> translate<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.990> better

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that'll translate into better

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
that'll translate into better
