00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
okay oh yeah that's a harder one to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
okay oh yeah that's a harder one to
answer<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:57.329> much<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.660> game<00:00:57.899> will

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050

answer just about how much in game will
be<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.199> release<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.710> obviously<00:00:59.489> all<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
be in release because obviously all of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.090 
be in release because obviously all of
our<00:01:00.539> end<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.019> be<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.290> there<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.890> that

everything else but yes we will have
plenty<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.540> systems<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> things<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.530> do

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.020 

nor<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.530> know<00:01:23.829> how<00:01:24.280> large<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.640> sitting<00:01:24.909> such

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
nor you know how large is sitting such

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.999 
nor you know how large is sitting such
as<00:01:25.180> courses<00:01:25.570> actually<00:01:26.079> it's<00:01:26.530> differs<00:01:26.950> from

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
as courses actually it's differs from

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.679 
as courses actually it's differs from
place<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.399> place<00:01:27.430> forcing<00:01:28.000> itself<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.390> entire

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
place to place forcing itself is entire

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.170 
place to place forcing itself is entire
planet<00:01:29.259> not<00:01:29.350> just<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.649> city<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.579> it<00:01:31.090> will

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
planet not just the city so it will

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.719 
planet not just the city so it will
probably<00:01:31.390> be<00:01:31.509> larger<00:01:31.930> than<00:01:31.960> others<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:33.549> for

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
probably be larger than others but for

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.609 
probably be larger than others but for
instance<00:01:34.030> some<00:01:34.149> of<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.270> cities<00:01:34.570> on<00:01:34.720> Python<00:01:35.229> on

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
instance some of the cities on Python on

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.859 
instance some of the cities on Python on
horeb<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.189> you<00:01:36.939> will<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.149> pocket<00:01:37.570> cities

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
horeb and you will have pocket cities

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.210 
horeb and you will have pocket cities
that<00:01:37.960> will<00:01:38.110> vary<00:01:38.259> on<00:01:38.380> size<00:01:38.619> based<00:01:38.920> on<00:01:39.100> what

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
that will vary on size based on what

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.520 
that will vary on size based on what
they're<00:01:39.369> there<00:01:39.520> for<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:39.880> know<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.350> main

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
they're there for you know a the main

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.010 
they're there for you know a the main
city<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:41.979> type<00:01:42.159> on<00:01:42.369> where<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.729> Pacific<00:01:43.689> atomy

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
city of type on where the Pacific atomy

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.779 
city of type on where the Pacific atomy
is<00:01:44.140> we're<00:01:44.470> probably<00:01:44.679> much<00:01:45.009> bigger<00:01:45.310> than<00:01:45.460> one

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
is we're probably much bigger than one

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.240 
is we're probably much bigger than one
of<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.939> little<00:01:46.060> outpost<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:47.679> varies

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
of the little outpost so it just varies

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:58.230 
of the little outpost so it just varies
from<00:01:48.549> place<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.939> place

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.950 

you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.539 

so<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.079> have<00:02:03.170> released<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.740> lot<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.039> information

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
so we have released a lot of information

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.399 
so we have released a lot of information
about<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.820> dark<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.149> light<00:02:05.240> side<00:02:05.509> we<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.049> it

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
about the dark and light side we have it

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.870 
about the dark and light side we have it
and<00:02:06.590> if<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.799> play<00:02:06.979> kotor<00:02:07.460> you're<00:02:07.670> familiar

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
and if you play kotor you're familiar

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.110 
and if you play kotor you're familiar
with<00:02:08.179> what<00:02:08.479> we're<00:02:08.629> working<00:02:08.840> with<00:02:09.050> of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
with what we're working with of

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.160 
with what we're working with of

the way through in case there's

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.390 
the way through in case there's
performance<00:02:19.970> issues<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:21.170> sort<00:02:21.470> definitely

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
performance issues that sort definitely

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.920 
performance issues that sort definitely
in<00:02:22.459> an<00:02:22.519> awesome<00:02:22.879> system<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.269> have<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.810> we

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
dialogue system if you watch them

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.810 
dialogue system if you watch them
develop<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.680> walkthrough<00:02:54.160> you'll<00:02:54.370> go<00:02:54.520> through

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
develop a walkthrough you'll go through

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.040 
develop a walkthrough you'll go through
and<00:02:54.940> you'll<00:02:55.060> see<00:02:55.210> there<00:02:55.390> are<00:02:55.510> dark<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.870> light
