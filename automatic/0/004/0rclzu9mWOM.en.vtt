00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.089
 another recipe video here 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 vegan silver this time is there 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.969
 a great summer strawberry cream 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.190
 cake will make you the laue you 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.609
 present the cake is very suitable 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.550
 good for chilled now in summer at the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 hot temperatures to be eaten 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 and I really like it very much 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.330
 Well 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 You can also vary that nicely so 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 You can also bananas, for example 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 pick and the apple through bananas 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.099
 Replace when the strawberry season passes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.020
 is or something and I wish you now 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.030
 have fun while the thumb thumbs 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.649
 high if you have more recipes and volt 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.170
 Write something which companies do 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.660
 you like to eat cake and that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 would need for the dough first mail 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 I'll take spelled flour here then 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.190
 We still high sugar apple market he 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.829
 always sits down for oil or 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.309
 margarine then we need rice 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.039
 sweet we need plants drinking 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 sparkling food starch and natron the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.629
 By the way, you will find all quantities 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the video description first of all 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 I now have the dry ingredients 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 all made pure and could always be with 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.619
 a whisk around it all 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.420
 is also nicely distributed and do it now 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 I still remember the liquid ingredients 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 families too, and then we'll see each other 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 immediately left you can now 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 liquid ingredients now see them 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.080
 dry and I use it here now 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.509
 is a hand mixer which is partly 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 I found out easier 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.979
 and I would recommend it I have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.570
 ever shown in the beginning recipe and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.610
 Now I give the liquid ingredients 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.409
 just gradually and stirred 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.070
 that then until a creamy one 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.040
 consistency thus arises the consistency 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.070
 now about as you can see 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.570
 like a normal day and me 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.729
 have now greased the form here well 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.649
 because that's really important to the cake 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.600
 can be subsequently solved better out 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.250
 although now is happening then I have 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.380
 still a little bit of coconut oil 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.329
 done because it just easier 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.060
 is and I felt the divide in now 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.789
 defend so know and then comes the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.959
 cake for me at 180 degrees alright 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.830
 tell you how much longer 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.379
 it was exactly 25 in the cake 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 minutes in there but that's just me 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.160
 Also not high and the wild animal 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.310
 right on ten sentences I had in 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.010
 a 22 centimeter shape baked 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.650
 maybe even only 20 cm and there works 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.810
 the ground has become relatively high and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.420
 This time i just wanted more from 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.120
 cake and have the reason in the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.430
 bigger fully made it is a 26 cm 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.480
 shape then just is not that high 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.550
 but then you have more volume in general 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.739
 or a larger area and 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.410
 yes, you see, that's a bit 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.000
 turned golden brown and I'll do it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.310
 the toothpick sample you know 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.290
 probably just a bland star 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.050
 the cake is also little life 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.599
 good and the truck now really please 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.760
 completely cool otherwise I'm running 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.680
 afterwards the cream on top 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.709
 and the good thing is that I am 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.000
 really greased the mold 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.550
 cant the springform right now 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.629
 already do it directly and have just like that 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.269
 the possibility that the cake 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.390
 therefore, the conversion becomes faster cold 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.550
 if she was not there , that's the cake 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.440
 is discontinued right now 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.060
 In any case , I cut now 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.569
 in the time how acidic take on me I 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.150
 the soy trip to beat for yourself 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.459
 I 've been with the spray cans so far 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.620
 Bad experiences made that would 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.390
 then sometime to spray 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.720
 That's why I always wanted it 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.720
 There's also coconut and tear I have 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.489
 now, however, in our biomarkets 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.930
 and that I would have gotten good here 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.159
 like to try the cocoons but not 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.980
 despite that is very very good 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.510
 to pitch and yes I do now 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.840
 you also do not need oxygen or 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.280
 otherwise something and then yes then have 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.500
 I already cut the come 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.500
 then still under lifted and it comes 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.420
 then everything on the cake so I have the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.329
 say now finished open 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.799
 which is already stiff and here 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.260
 the cake I have now back in the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.150
 form made because then it runs me 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.859
 Do not sun out and have it now 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.180
 the spd I have really very small 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.459
 This is a lot of work 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.009
 So you can someone like that 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.289
 hire the one that comes for you and 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.930
 I have that easily under the 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.930
 saarner so with the spoon or so and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.699
 then spread the whole thing up now 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.639
 and then I'll just show you later 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.190
 how the finished cake looks like that 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.440
 the cake now looks like you see 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.900
 piece is already cut off but with it 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.110
 you can look here and the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.490
 jan is now doing a taste test I 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.650
 I'm back in line with that 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:58.330
 Taste it and you already from the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:05:00.310
 I know the videos and I do the norad 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.380
 which marriage proposal would be even good 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.510
 last passed highlight comes one 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.789
 new recipe like you here sampler vegan

 Today I'll show you through one 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.070
 vegan danube likes to do that and that is 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.919
 you apart from the chocolate the 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.919
 weed gets pretty fat so
