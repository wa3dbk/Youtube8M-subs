to pop it and just stay there and yeah
what<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.180> trying<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
what I think of what I'm trying to do it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.440 
what I think of what I'm trying to do it
is<00:01:43.049> um<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.979> pop<00:01:44.310> push<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> backwards<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.329> your

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
is um you pop push it backwards and your

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
is um you pop push it backwards and your
front<00:01:45.689> foot<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.950> same

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
front foot is like kind of just the same

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.810 
front foot is like kind of just the same
motion<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.880> comes<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> side<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
motion but it comes out to the side and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.160 
motion but it comes out to the side and
really<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:50.909> try<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> kick<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.630> 90

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
really just try to kick up that 90

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.679 
really just try to kick up that 90
degrees<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.740> find<00:01:53.460> once<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> flick<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
degrees I find once you flick it and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
degrees I find once you flick it and
it's<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> try<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> flick<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> 90

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
it's if you try to flick it to 90

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.889 
it's if you try to flick it to 90
degrees<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.640> generally<00:01:57.270> always<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
degrees you're generally always going to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
degrees you're generally always going to
come<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.340> now<00:01:59.340> when<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.579> approaching

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
come around now when you're approaching

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.820 
come around now when you're approaching
the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.190 
the
it<00:02:00.980> you're<00:02:01.310> going<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.550> kind<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:01.790> like<00:02:02.140> take<00:02:03.140> a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
it you're going to kind of like take a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.660 
it you're going to kind of like take a
little<00:02:03.440> gander<00:02:03.650> at<00:02:03.950> where<00:02:04.070> you're<00:02:04.220> popping<00:02:04.610> it

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
little gander at where you're popping it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.010 
little gander at where you're popping it
from<00:02:04.880> make<00:02:05.090> sure<00:02:05.210> there's<00:02:05.360> no<00:02:05.480> cracks<00:02:05.660> or

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
from make sure there's no cracks or

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.410 
from make sure there's no cracks or
rocks<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:07.100> finally<00:02:07.430> kind<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.730> take<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.910> look

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
rocks and I finally kind of take a look

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.330 
rocks and I finally kind of take a look
and<00:02:08.660> then<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.930> start<00:02:09.259> your<00:02:09.410> start<00:02:10.130> bending

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and then you start your start bending

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340 
and then you start your start bending
down<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.000> also<00:02:11.150> start<00:02:11.510> winding<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.170> bit

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
down and you also start winding up a bit

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.810 
down and you also start winding up a bit
just<00:02:12.950> you're<00:02:13.130> going<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> have<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.790> little

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
just you're going to have just a little

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.910 
just you're going to have just a little
bit<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.480> rotation<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.590> shoulders

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
bit of a rotation on your shoulders

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.820 
bit of a rotation on your shoulders
going<00:02:16.100> on<00:02:16.340> right<00:02:16.610> before<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> pop<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
going on right before you pop and you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.870 
going on right before you pop and you
know<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:19.100> all<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.460> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.730> give<00:02:19.820> you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
know that's all just going to give you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.050 
know that's all just going to give you
the<00:02:19.940> 180-degree<00:02:20.570> rotation<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.000> said

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
the 180-degree rotation and like I said

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.400 
the 180-degree rotation and like I said
you're<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.540> try<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:24.020> try<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.170> kick

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
you're going to try to just try to kick

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.580 
you're going to try to just try to kick
at<00:02:24.500> 90<00:02:24.740> degrees<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:26.420> know<00:02:26.570> hopefully<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
at 90 degrees and you know hopefully you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
at 90 degrees and you know hopefully you
know<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.710> grip<00:02:28.070> tape<00:02:28.220> will<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.460> rotating

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
know the grip tape will be rotating

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.850 
know the grip tape will be rotating
around<00:02:29.270> you'll<00:02:29.540> see<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.840> might<00:02:30.500> give<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.800> a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
around you'll see it might give it a

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.320 
around you'll see it might give it a
little<00:02:30.980> back<00:02:31.280> wheel<00:02:31.490> pivot<00:02:31.940> if<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.180> not

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
little back wheel pivot if it's not

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.230 
little back wheel pivot if it's not
quite<00:02:32.570> there<00:02:32.810> or<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:34.220> know<00:02:34.370> hopefully<00:02:35.030> it

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
quite there or you know hopefully it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.570 
quite there or you know hopefully it
comes<00:02:35.420> around<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:36.530> remember<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.980> rotate

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
comes around just remember to rotate

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.610 
comes around just remember to rotate
those<00:02:37.730> shoulders<00:02:38.270> because<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.810> thought<00:02:39.410> you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
those shoulders because I thought you

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100 
those shoulders because I thought you
might<00:02:39.820> not<00:02:40.820> rotate<00:02:41.180> all<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> way<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.900> just

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
might not rotate all the way and just

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.040 
might not rotate all the way and just
like<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.620> know<00:02:42.709> don't<00:02:42.920> want<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.130> stick<00:02:44.050> get

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
like you know don't want to stick get

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.390 
like you know don't want to stick get
out<00:02:45.200> there<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:45.680> everything<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.310> all

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
out there like everything it's all

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.610 
out there like everything it's all

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
practice my cream oh why not rotate it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.370 
practice my cream oh why not rotate it
all<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.770> way<00:02:48.980> but<00:02:49.750> you're<00:02:50.750> out<00:02:50.870> there<00:02:51.110> it's
