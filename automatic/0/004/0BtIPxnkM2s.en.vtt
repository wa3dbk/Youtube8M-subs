now<00:00:00.630> if<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.800> have<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> total<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.610> many

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
now if we have a total of this many

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.849 
now if we have a total of this many
sharps<00:00:03.540> seven<00:00:03.929> sharps<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.529> as<00:00:04.650> many

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859

sharks<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.370> can<00:00:05.549> possibly<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:06.120> one

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
sharks that we can possibly have one

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.480 
sharks that we can possibly have one
sharp<00:00:07.350> above<00:00:07.970> d<00:00:08.970> sharp<00:00:09.650> or<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.920> sharp<00:00:11.219> here

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
sharp above d sharp or be sharp here

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.870 
sharp above d sharp or be sharp here
rather<00:00:11.809> will<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.259> half<00:00:13.950> step<00:00:14.190> above<00:00:14.340> d<00:00:14.639> sharp

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
rather will be a half step above d sharp

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.019 
rather will be a half step above d sharp
is<00:00:15.089> C<00:00:15.360> sharp<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.340> would<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> key<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> C

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
is C sharp so this would be the key of C

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.939 
is C sharp so this would be the key of C
sharp<00:00:18.390> major<00:00:18.510> remember<00:00:19.020> C<00:00:19.230> major<00:00:19.470> has<00:00:19.770> all

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
sharp major remember C major has all

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.400 
sharp major remember C major has all
naturals<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.060> C<00:00:21.270> sharp<00:00:21.539> major<00:00:21.720> having<00:00:22.230> all

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
naturals so C sharp major having all

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
naturals so C sharp major having all
sharps<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:23.340> sense<00:00:23.730> everything<00:00:24.390> has<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.689> be

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
sharps make sense everything has to be

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.609 
sharps make sense everything has to be
sharped<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.470> change<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.890> let's<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.060> flats

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
sharped to change it let's look at flats

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.400 
sharped to change it let's look at flats
okay<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.400> memorize<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
okay you just have to memorize with that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
okay you just have to memorize with that
one<00:00:31.410> flat<00:00:31.740> indicates<00:00:32.399> where<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> key<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> F

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
one flat indicates where in the key of F

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.080 
one flat indicates where in the key of F
major<00:00:33.559> that's<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.800> B<00:00:34.980> flat<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> F<00:00:35.640> major<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
major that's that B flat and F major and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.260 
major that's that B flat and F major and
everything<00:00:36.390> else<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.660> natural<00:00:37.550> okay<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:39.210> we

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
everything else is natural okay now we

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.420 
everything else is natural okay now we
can<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> rule<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.739> second<00:00:41.190> from<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
can use the rule the second from the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
can use the rule the second from the
last<00:00:41.760> flat<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> key<00:00:43.710> signature<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:46.050> we

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
last flat is the key signature so if we

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.060 
last flat is the key signature so if we
have<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.160> flats<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.690> first<00:00:49.020> flat<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.620> B<00:00:49.829> flat

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
have two flats the first flat is B flat

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.020 
have two flats the first flat is B flat
a<00:00:50.370> key<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.270> B<00:00:51.480> flat<00:00:52.219> if<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.399> three<00:00:53.730> flats

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
a key is B flat if we have three flats

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.560 
a key is B flat if we have three flats
the<00:00:54.510> second<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> last<00:00:56.360> furthest<00:00:57.360> out

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the second from the last furthest out

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.139 
the second from the last furthest out
you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.800> flat<00:00:59.340> our<00:01:00.329> key<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.690> E<00:01:00.840> flat<00:01:02.149> we

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you know is a flat our key is E flat we

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.149 
you know is a flat our key is E flat we
have<00:01:03.390> our<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:04.379> many<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.309> seven<00:01:06.150> flats

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
have our as many as we can seven flats

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.880 
have our as many as we can seven flats
then<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> our<00:01:09.510> flat<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> our<00:01:10.710> key

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
then this is our flat this is our key

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.480 
then this is our flat this is our key
signature<00:01:11.430> okay<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.549> f<00:01:15.920> a-c-c<00:01:16.920> flat<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
signature okay this is f a-c-c flat and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.899 
signature okay this is f a-c-c flat and
it<00:01:17.909> makes<00:01:18.119> sense<00:01:18.330> once<00:01:18.659> again<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.759> would

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it makes sense once again that we would

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.170 
it makes sense once again that we would
have<00:01:21.170> it's<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.890> flats<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> key<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> C<00:01:23.939> flat

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
have it's all flats in the key of C flat

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
have it's all flats in the key of C flat
to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.540> C<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:24.930> naturals<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.460> your

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
to get C has naturals so this is your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
to get C has naturals so this is your
way<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.790> determining<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.630> flats<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.229> sharps

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
way of determining your flats and sharps

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.910 
way of determining your flats and sharps
if<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> look<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.560> we<00:01:31.560> had<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> key

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
if you look down here if we had a key

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.210 
if you look down here if we had a key
signature<00:01:32.400> such<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:33.140> G<00:01:34.140> major<00:01:34.530> remember<00:01:35.070> F

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
front of it which makes it natural so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.940 
front of it which makes it natural so
this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.470> e<00:01:46.770> F<00:01:47.220> sharp<00:01:47.509> F<00:01:48.509> e<00:01:49.049> it'll<00:01:49.920> sound<00:01:50.070> like

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.230 

so<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.070> 2<00:01:56.280> f's<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:56.579> different<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.000> when<00:01:57.149> we

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so these 2 f's are different but when we
