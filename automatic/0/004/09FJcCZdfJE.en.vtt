00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.280 
up to the top you get some color options
you<00:01:18.799> know<00:01:18.890> black<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.310> white<00:01:19.430> sepia<00:01:20.290> negative

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
you can go into light metering you know

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.249 
you can go into light metering you know
evaluative<00:01:25.670> spot<00:01:26.030> Center<00:01:26.509> weighted<00:01:26.659> stuff

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
evaluative spot Center weighted stuff

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.690 
evaluative spot Center weighted stuff
like<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.280> change<00:01:28.399> your<00:01:28.520> image

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
like that and you can change your image

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.529 
like that and you can change your image
quality<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.469> recording<00:01:30.469> pixels<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.729> your

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
quality and recording pixels and your

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.630 
quality and recording pixels and your
compression<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.860> one<00:01:34.219> thing<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.520> know

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
compression and one thing you know

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.850 
compression and one thing you know
that's<00:01:35.180> important<00:01:35.689> about<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.439> it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
that's important about this is it it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.179 
that's important about this is it it
records<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.460> high-def<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:39.649> full<00:01:39.829> hi-def

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
records in high-def but it's full hi-def

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.800 
records in high-def but it's full hi-def
so<00:01:40.399> it's<00:01:40.549> 1920<00:01:41.149> by<00:01:41.270> 1080<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.250> it's<00:01:43.250> at<00:01:43.810> 24

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
so it's 1920 by 1080 and it's at 24

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.450 
so it's 1920 by 1080 and it's at 24
frames<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.200> second<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.710> doesn't<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.100> any<00:01:46.340> other

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
frames a second it doesn't do any other

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.639 
frames a second it doesn't do any other
frames<00:01:46.759> per<00:01:47.299> second<00:01:47.750> does<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.530> give<00:01:48.619> you

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
frames per second does it give you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.310 
frames per second does it give you
options<00:01:49.100> for<00:01:49.159> any<00:01:49.399> other<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:49.960> but<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.109> it's

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
options for any other so but it's it's

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.469 
options for any other so but it's it's
good<00:01:51.530> because<00:01:51.920> most<00:01:52.219> other<00:01:52.520> cameras<00:01:53.329> that

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
good because most other cameras that

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.450 
good because most other cameras that
shoot<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.229> know<00:01:55.390> 1920<00:01:56.390> by<00:01:56.509> 1080<00:01:56.930> are<00:01:57.460> also

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
shoot you know 1920 by 1080 are also

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.399 
shoot you know 1920 by 1080 are also
have<00:01:58.820> an<00:01:58.909> option<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.270> shoot<00:01:59.450> 24<00:02:00.020> frames<00:02:00.289> a

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
have an option to shoot 24 frames a

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.020 
have an option to shoot 24 frames a
second<00:02:00.710> which<00:02:00.859> is<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.070> standard<00:02:01.429> for<00:02:01.609> film

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
second which is the standard for film

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.069 
second which is the standard for film
and<00:02:02.299> then<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.320> know<00:02:03.409> basically<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:03.979> your<00:02:04.009> menu
