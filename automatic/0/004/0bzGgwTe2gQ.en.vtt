00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 dance couple puts us even if 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.490
 no to amalgamate to begin to understand 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.349
 where where can push the limit 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 they clearly begin to go much more 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.910
 together they also begin to know 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.670
 better and really great to hear 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 white bench of maurizio margaglio e 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.350
 indeed, I thank you for the fact that he has remained 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.340
 our company is a volume 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.949
 very good instead you 're here because 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 now we'll all be here to cheer for 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 our blues while on 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.829
 ice made the entrance of one 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.110
 stock tahrir went to the third European 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.050
 twenty-first in 2011 fourteenth 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 last year and them for the fourth year 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.200
 consecutive they won the championships 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.200
 national 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.660
 in May 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.740
 in May and with the Iranian ribbon is 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.620
 another kind of atmosphere returned 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.500
 we can say maurizio here at the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.360
 dams brought a way of zagreb 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.910
 interpret the door completely 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.720
 different from the Russian couples we have 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.760
 seen above 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.410
 yes well on them we must say everything 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.090
 who are very young even though there 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.680
 we have been seeing for a few years even at the level 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.240
 senior and the first year of it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.120
 they dedicate only this category a year 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.580
 last they did both junior scoring 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.709
 so surely they are the youngest of 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.570
 these last two groups is only one 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.970
 couple who must find constancy 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.160
 because they still alternate perhaps 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.740
 fantastic performance benefits a 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.230
 a little bit more disappointing I would say that I am not 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.940
 Russians here is this is not fair for del 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.690
 all because they train in fly 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.580
 all year round, but this yes though 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.680
 Estonia, for example, is one of the countries 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.200
 new that worked well say 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.120
 in the last 15 years it has been producing couples 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.570
 interesting have a good movement 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.850
 youth 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:51.220
 in short, it is a reality that is beginning 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:54.220
 to have good successes and therefore 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.729
 this is a pleasure to see 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.950
 see the Baltic countries for example a 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.050
 another mantra of things that those who do 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.410
 pleasure to see European entry 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.020
 we are looking at the score 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.990
 how the judges are already evaluating the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.810
 their structure conza of the Romanian gallup 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.400
 from us 1 the second behind is 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.800
 especially what you see that 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600
 the specialists have given timings 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.880
 so it means the steps actually 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.560
 they were correct but made with no time 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.990
 right not 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.200
 not following the true rhythm of the polka e 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.360
 in my opinion just as I told you couple 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.130
 young the polka a lot dance 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.960
 difficult and still have to improve 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.550
 these little details console us 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.660
 be precise about bass not being 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.330
 perfect on the subject 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.910
 but this time, however, continues to do 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.419
 all mad is the double all these 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.490
 precise steps are not just the polka and the 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.800
 patten dance in general that is to have 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.620
 inserted those that were once the 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.770
 obligatory dance in this short 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.460
 dance have on one hand distorted that 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.380
 which was mandatory on the other 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.870
 force the kids to be precise about 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.729
 123 steps to the maximum and then you play 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.220
 all really about a little thing 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:19.580
 just see dinho of raised snow 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:24.560
 during a thread that is not given then the 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.200
 beautiful the ugly regulation can be seen 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.660
 in fact 50 51 is not the worst 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:35.900
 fantastic they go for a penny behind 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:37.760
 to the Czech couple and therefore perhaps in short 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.910
 they were a bit surprising in the latter 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.780
 two groups were reported to 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.740
 reality 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.740
 absolutely to reality
