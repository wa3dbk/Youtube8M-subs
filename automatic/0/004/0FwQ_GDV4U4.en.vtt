pinnacle speed product so it's a shoe
that<00:00:15.120> really<00:00:15.870> redefines<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.250> means<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
that really redefines what it means to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.000 
that really redefines what it means to
be<00:00:17.609> lightweight<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.439> fastest<00:00:19.770> player<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
be lightweight and the fastest player on

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.920 
be lightweight and the fastest player on
the<00:00:20.100> court<00:00:20.220> players<00:00:20.640> are<00:00:20.910> looking<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.510> more

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the court players are looking for more

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.080 
the court players are looking for more
of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.170> lightweight<00:00:22.619> cushion<00:00:23.130> feel<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.640> court

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
of a lightweight cushion feel on court

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.970 
of a lightweight cushion feel on court
and<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.720> thought<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> lunar<00:00:25.320> technology

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and we thought that the lunar technology

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.300 
and we thought that the lunar technology
with<00:00:26.490> dropping<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> players<00:00:28.320> feet<00:00:28.710> closer<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
with dropping the players feet closer to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.189 
with dropping the players feet closer to
the<00:00:29.369> court<00:00:29.609> surface<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.090> well<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.750> often<00:00:31.050> them

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the court surface as well as often them

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
the court surface as well as often them
a<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.560> resilient<00:00:31.980> cushioning<00:00:32.460> provides

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
a really resilient cushioning provides

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.209 
a really resilient cushioning provides
that<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.960> utilize<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.680> supply<00:00:34.950> wire

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that we utilize the supply wire

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
that we utilize the supply wire
technology<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.450> cases<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
technology which really in cases the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
technology which really in cases the
foot<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.640> lightweight

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
supportive upper and we really actually

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
supportive upper and we really actually
try<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> lock<00:00:42.000> down<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> mid-foot<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.809> the

next-generation<00:00:46.260> fly<00:00:46.770> wire<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.399> have

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
next-generation fly wire and just have

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.369 
next-generation fly wire and just have
some<00:00:47.610> cut<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:47.969> windows<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.050> expose<00:00:49.320> the

some cut out windows here to expose the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319 
some cut out windows here to expose the
Flywire<00:00:49.920> bring<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> little<00:00:50.640> bit<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Flywire bring a little bit of this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
Flywire bring a little bit of this
performance<00:00:52.230> cue<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> consumer<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
performance cue to the consumer and so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240 
performance cue to the consumer and so
they<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.110> technology<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
they can see what this technology is and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.799 
they can see what this technology is and
just<00:00:56.489> exposing<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.329> bit<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.570> there

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
discovery to this polo you turn it

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.370 
discovery to this polo you turn it
around<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.280> back<00:02:00.610> you'll<00:02:01.299> see<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.899> bit<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.289> a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
around to the back you'll see a bit of a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.149 
around to the back you'll see a bit of a
Swiss<00:02:02.710> cross<00:02:03.159> inspired<00:02:04.649> perforated<00:02:05.649> pattern

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
Swiss cross inspired perforated pattern

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.430 
Swiss cross inspired perforated pattern
this<00:02:06.850> does<00:02:07.119> provide<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.539> SPO<00:02:07.869> amount<00:02:08.229> more

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
this does provide a SPO amount more

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.469 
this does provide a SPO amount more
breathability<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:09.580> more<00:02:09.819> so<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.269> tells

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
breathability but more so it tells

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
breathability but more so it tells
personal<00:02:11.260> story<00:02:11.890> for<00:02:12.099> logic
