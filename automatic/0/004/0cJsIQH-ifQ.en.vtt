00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.130
 you to answer your questions 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 so for this reason I thank you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.520
 questions will have to be asked as usual 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 on my facebook page you are 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.150
 in fact, as Joseph Diemer, I leave you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.250
 linking description is enough for you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 go and visit it and then not just 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 I will be able to do a post to tell you go 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.369
 guys ask me all the questions that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.019
 you want and then you can then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 sign up she remind you that you can 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.969
 follow me also on instagram where now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 we are more than 6000 type 6,400 for more 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.629
 guys really thank you a bang 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.329
 especially in the holiday period in 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.710
 which in fact I am at the moment but this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.719
 video has been recorded before 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.399
 I will publish a lot of photos because i 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.629
 guys, I'll wait for you on Instagram 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 but it is enough to lose ourselves in chatter 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 so let's start immediately with the question of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 giuseppe asking us ceo josef 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.360
 I want to ask you this question if I had 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 a time machine which is the period 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.530
 historical that you would like to visit there is there 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 written to go though on the pon visit 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.100
 this is a really cool question 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.530
 guys because there would be a brothel 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 of places I would like to visit first 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 place the Mesozoic era or otherwise 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 it should be called that if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 or the one in which there are dinosaurs 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.780
 I would go there only if he had the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 sure not to be torn alive there 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.500
 there are many other cool historical periods 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.409
 such as that I know the one in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.210
 egypt when they built the pyramids 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 or that I know particular revolutions 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.479
 admitted they don't want to kill me by 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.939
 there are really historical periods 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.490
 so many let me know you too 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 comments which period you would like 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.900
 visit maybe it could be one 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.409
 good idea to start a small one 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.810
 conversation with you 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.180
 well who asks us if Joseph didn't have 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.200
 had success on youtube what you would have 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.210
 done in life 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.890
 now that the 100,000 registered is the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.229
 I dream of arriving one day maybe at a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 million guys like you really know a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.799
 great dream maybe 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.329
 reach ever higher peaks 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.909
 but we have already talked about this thing 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.500
 in one of the previous blogs without youtube 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.630
 my life would obviously have been 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.460
 very very different though i in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.710
 meanwhile I'm continuing anyway a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.450
 carry on the university proceeds 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.920
 slowly but unfortunately it is not a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.800
 problem because I want to carry on 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.990
 two basic things for me 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 then youtube and the francesco university 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.520
 joseph asks us what you think of 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.530
 virtual reality of the slip niche and the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.780
 new microsoft helmet that will be released in 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.370
 short is going to buy one 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.590
 grit brough continue so you greet yourself 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.660
 sure I greet Francesco as well as the two 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.400
 previous boys but above all everyone 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.850
 those who always make me like them 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.100
 questions 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.810
 however, reconnecting to the reality discourse 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.040
 I really like virtual guys 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.320
 lot 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.090
 I would like to buy a new luz in the future 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.830
 rift guys why register us 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.260
 video in my opinion is something absurd 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.510
 the real very very cool and then you 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.100
 fully empathize with the game you think 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.700
 girls horror games for how they are 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.950
 I made it 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.020
 I really will not know to cry 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.120
 tell you if virtual reality will be the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.610
 however, the future of video games is 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.680
 a panorama to explore but above all 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.630
 on which maybe you have to invest because 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.790
 could really give us so many in the future 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.620
 so much satisfaction samuel asks us 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.780
 what was the most requested series e 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.460
 which series did you like the most 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.590
 series that I was most in demand is 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.150
 was the absolute dragon volk servers 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.040
 boy now without telling you it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.080
 you all know why it was a game 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.300
 really that I learned so much then 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.130
 it is also the series that I liked the most 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.570
 bring on the channel if the contending bit 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.790
 you know with assassin's creed unity 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.770
 but really the dragon videos 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.080
 brussels overs you were asked to 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.090
 I went on and let two or three come out 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.280
 however, there was always the day 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.170
 Joseph's usual question when the comes 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.880
 next video of drive folk servers 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.790
 denis asks us if I had the chance 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.989
 to read your future you would do it 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.209
 beautiful josef 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.030
 in truth many boys would say no 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.850
 I, instead, as I am made, I would say of 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.620
 yes for me it would be really great 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.970
 know your future kids and it is 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.760
 one thing if I had the chance 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.340
 I would do it for sure from the creed 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.010
 that anyone would like to take a look 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.020
 to their future , perhaps even to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.760
 just a few minutes to understand 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.800
 a little how things will go unfortunately 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.550
 it is not really possible a great one 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.290
 sin 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.600
 maybe in the future I know they will create 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.730
 some strange machinery however one 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.320
 certain technology that will allow us 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.209
 precisely by reconnecting to the first 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.609
 time travel application or 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.650
 anyway to see just ahead in 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.080
 time however name could be a great one 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.970
 cool I hope but not too proud of it 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.500
 he asks us what ibra but when 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.930
 your life on youtube your parents 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.210
 how they reacted you are great 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.670
 so keep saying hello to me 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.680
 also piera initially was a bit 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.240
 difficult to make my parents understand 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.550
 parents what I did because 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.130
 speak in the room in front of one 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.200
 camera alone might maybe 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.940
 insinuate my parents some ugly 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.770
 suspect but then over time they are 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.960
 then managed to explain the situation 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.450
 I clearly explained what 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.830
 I did it because I did it and so did them 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.330
 they said oh well it really looks like one 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.280
 what nice you're doing 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.410
 but the important thing is that you carry on 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.420
 university and oh well it seems to me a thing 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.610
 right no after some small change of 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.560
 Lighting of the frame we pass 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.720
 to the question of max fox that asks us 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.580
 brough you could survive only 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.890
 in the forest I believe the answer is 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.860
 no since you will go into total panic 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.660
 being alone against game 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.580
 Mamma mia what a difficult word though 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.260
 oh well part jokes probably 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.150
 it will not be easy to survive 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.610
 here maybe I could start right now 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.740
 to see documentaries or follow the guides 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.750
 of the karoo bear grylls to survive a 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.580
 Kevin asks us and Joseph some time 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.560
 ago you said you didn't care about 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.690
 scared and you wouldn't have spent money on 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.669
 this game now starts you at will 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.770
 and you're passionate about it or you only do it for 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.020
 we members like the game very much 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.580
 I decided to buy fifa 15 because 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.950
 really many have asked me 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.479
 just to bring us some videos I saw it 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.390
 at a very advantageous price 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.950
 on the 20 25 euros because I said could 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.570
 be a good idea to retrieve it I 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.120
 started making videos of us 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.070
 although I repeat it still does not have 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.840
 the passion, however, for football 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.880
 I really enjoyed playing with it 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.710
 therefore for this reason I will also take 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.410
 fifa 16 in order to have fun 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.060
 together maybe you can also propose me 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.010
 of challenges and things of this kind 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.630
 so guys I repeat football 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.950
 I don't like however at least a 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.520
 play scared that still a 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.320
 video game 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.300
 I enjoy it so you guys watch the video yes 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.220
 concludes here I recommend follow me up 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.840
 facebook and instagram found linke 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.820
 description because in this period on 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.950
 posting quite a lot of place but 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.960
 especially of photos at the sea we overcome the 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:31.240
 So I like 2,000 for this video 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.240
 Ragazzoni and a greeting is the next hello
