off-roading<00:00:06.750> equipment<00:00:07.259> as<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.440> can<00:00:07.560> see

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
off-roading equipment as you can see

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.799 
off-roading equipment as you can see
back<00:00:07.859> there<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.309> I'm<00:00:09.179> pretty<00:00:09.389> close<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
back there and I'm pretty close to

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.419 
back there and I'm pretty close to
Carroll<00:00:10.139> peak<00:00:10.349> elementary<00:00:10.830> school<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.280> just

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
Carroll peak elementary school so just

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.470 
Carroll peak elementary school so just
thought<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.610> wanted<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> give<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.269> guys<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
thought I wanted to give you guys a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.799 
thought I wanted to give you guys a
quick<00:00:12.719> shout<00:00:13.019> out<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.349> say<00:00:13.500> hi<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.820> had<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
quick shout out and say hi so I had a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.630 
quick shout out and say hi so I had a
lot<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> fun<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.619> were<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.859> when<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.490> was

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
lot of fun when we were with when I was

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460 
lot of fun when we were with when I was
visiting<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.390> guys<00:00:18.630> back<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.900> November

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
visiting it you guys back in November

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
visiting it you guys back in November
and<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> things<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.580> mentioned

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and one of the things that I mentioned

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.210 
and one of the things that I mentioned
was<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.090> science<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:21.960> around<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.680> so

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
was that science is all around you so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.929 
was that science is all around you so
even<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.180> stuff<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.410> back<00:00:25.619> there

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
even with stuff like that back there

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.089 
even with stuff like that back there
it's<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.150> science<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.720> fact<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.230> big<00:00:28.769> part<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it's all science in fact a big part of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's all science in fact a big part of
it<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.480> frictional<00:00:30.560> off-roading<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> all

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
it is frictional off-roading is all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
it is frictional off-roading is all
about<00:00:32.070> traction<00:00:32.360> how<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.750> tires<00:00:34.020> can

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
about traction how well your tires can

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
about traction how well your tires can
grip<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> road<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:36.030> maximize<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.630> grip<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
grip the road to maximize that grip you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
grip the road to maximize that grip you
need<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> maximize<00:00:37.440> friction<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.910> ask

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
need to maximize friction so just ask

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
need to maximize friction so just ask
your<00:00:39.210> science<00:00:39.540> teacher<00:00:39.780> dead<00:00:40.110> finish<00:00:40.410> she<00:00:40.770> can

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
your science teacher dead finish she can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.549 
your science teacher dead finish she can
give<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> all<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> details<00:00:42.020> for<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.079> just

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
give you all the details for now just

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.790 
give you all the details for now just
think<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.890> high<00:00:44.820> friction<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.989> grip<00:00:46.260> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
think this high friction good grip so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060 
think this high friction good grip so
you<00:00:46.829> make<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> hill<00:00:47.850> low<00:00:48.780> friction<00:00:49.070> bad

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you make it up the hill low friction bad

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.720 
you make it up the hill low friction bad
grip<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:51.690> make<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> hill<00:00:52.730> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
grip you don't make it up the hill this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.490 
grip you don't make it up the hill this
even<00:00:54.000> works<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.360> mud<00:00:55.039> good<00:00:56.039> grip<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.550> make<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
even works in mud good grip you make it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.979 
even works in mud good grip you make it
bad<00:00:58.500> grip<00:00:58.770> Wow<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> best

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
bad grip Wow you don't to get the best

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.230 
bad grip Wow you don't to get the best
grip<00:01:04.170> possible<00:01:04.710> many<00:01:05.189> off-road<00:01:05.670> drivers<00:01:06.090> air

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
grip possible many off-road drivers air

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840 
grip possible many off-road drivers air
down<00:01:06.600> their<00:01:06.810> tires<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.830> means<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:08.580> air

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
down their tires which means to take air

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.890 
down their tires which means to take air
out<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.119> their<00:01:09.450> tires

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
out of their tires

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
out of their tires
a<00:01:10.080> normal<00:01:10.619> wheel<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> curved<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
a normal wheel is curved and when the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
a normal wheel is curved and when the
wheel<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.470> curved<00:01:13.770> he's<00:01:14.369> touching

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
wheel right it's curved he's touching

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
wheel right it's curved he's touching
the<00:01:14.850> rock<00:01:15.000> you've<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> small<00:01:15.689> part

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the rock you've only got a small part

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.620 
the rock you've only got a small part
actually<00:01:16.619> touching<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:18.150> airing<00:01:18.450> down

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
actually touching it what airing down

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.649 
actually touching it what airing down
does<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.380> deflates<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> tire<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
does is it deflates the tire so that you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.990 
does is it deflates the tire so that you
get<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:22.530> surface<00:01:22.770> area<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.820> more

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
get more surface area and so more

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
get more surface area and so more
traction<00:01:24.710> basically<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:25.920> space<00:01:26.189> for

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
traction basically more space for

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.830 
traction basically more space for
friction<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.360> rock

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
friction on that rock

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.179 
friction on that rock
so<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.200> doing<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.650> you're

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so what you're doing is you're

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.640 
so what you're doing is you're
increasing<00:01:29.939> friction<00:01:30.180> by<00:01:30.990> increasing<00:01:31.619> your

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
increasing friction by increasing your

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
increasing friction by increasing your
surface<00:01:32.100> area<00:01:32.369> which<00:01:32.820> gives<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.150> more

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
surface area which gives you more

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.140 
surface area which gives you more
traction<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.229> pull<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.400> makes<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> big

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
traction to pull off this makes a big

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
traction to pull off this makes a big
difference<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:36.960> well<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.560> handle

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
difference in how well you can handle

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.060 
difference in how well you can handle
trails<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> difference<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.750> see

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
trails it's a difference you can see

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.969 
trails it's a difference you can see
check<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.189> out<00:01:41.750> here<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.140> tire<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> full<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
check this out here the tire is full of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
check this out here the tire is full of
air<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:45.360> how<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> isn't<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:45.869> smushed<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
air see how it isn't too smushed at the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.920 
air see how it isn't too smushed at the
bottom<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> rocks<00:01:47.930> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
bottom as it's going over the rocks it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.190 
bottom as it's going over the rocks it's
not<00:01:49.170> making<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.829> hill<00:01:50.479> now<00:01:51.479> here's<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
not making it up that hill now here's a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
not making it up that hill now here's a
tire<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.590> been<00:01:52.770> aired<00:01:53.009> down<00:01:53.360> see<00:01:54.360> how

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
tire that's been aired down see how

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.780 
tire that's been aired down see how
smooshed<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> looks<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> bottom<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
smooshed it looks at the bottom the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
smooshed it looks at the bottom the
tires<00:01:57.060> spreading<00:01:57.659> out<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.310> maximizing

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
tires spreading out and so maximizing

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.910 
tires spreading out and so maximizing
friction<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.090> making<00:02:01.079> sure<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.680> make

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
friction and making sure that you make

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
friction and making sure that you make
it<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> end<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.090> trail<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:04.200> remember

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it to the end of your trail so remember

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.310 
it to the end of your trail so remember
guys<00:02:04.680> science<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:06.000> around<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> never

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
guys science is all around you and never

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.719 
guys science is all around you and never
forget<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.799> ABCs

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
forget your ABCs

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.899 
forget your ABCs
always<00:02:09.729> curious<00:02:10.650> until<00:02:11.650> next<00:02:11.769> time<00:02:12.010> take<00:02:12.519> care

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
always curious until next time take care

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.989 
always curious until next time take care
hopefully<00:02:13.569> see<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.780> soon
