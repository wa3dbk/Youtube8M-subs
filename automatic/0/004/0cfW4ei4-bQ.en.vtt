my<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:14.790> thing<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.689> should<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.960> do

Gees on your own what you can do is you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.450 
Gees on your own what you can do is you

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
you can do the combat if you want to but

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.710 
you can do the combat if you want to but
even<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:14.710> you<00:03:14.800> farm<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.700> surrounding<00:03:16.330> areas

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
even if you farm the surrounding areas

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.440 
even if you farm the surrounding areas
and<00:03:16.930> farm<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.620> artifacts<00:03:18.160> every<00:03:18.760> artifact<00:03:19.330> is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
and farm of artifacts every artifact is

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.180 
and farm of artifacts every artifact is
essentially<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.050> honour<00:03:20.260> point<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.100> you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
essentially one honour point so if you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.860 
essentially one honour point so if you
run<00:03:21.340> around<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.580> zones<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.480> don't<00:03:22.720> like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
run around the zones and you don't like

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.090 
run around the zones and you don't like
really<00:03:23.110> empty<00:03:23.320> server<00:03:23.590> or<00:03:23.740> something<00:03:23.890> like

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
really empty server or something like

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.560 
really empty server or something like
that<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.880> can<00:03:24.970> grow<00:03:25.090> another<00:03:25.210> zones<00:03:25.450> get

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
that and you can grow another zones get

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.540 
that and you can grow another zones get
all<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.840> rares<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.170> everything<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:27.310> can<00:03:27.430> get

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
all the rares and everything you can get

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.920 
all the rares and everything you can get
a<00:03:27.580> lot<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.120> honor<00:03:28.300> out<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.870> you

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
a lot of honor out of that and you

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
a lot of honor out of that and you
turned<00:03:29.140> into<00:03:29.320> your<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.670> turn<00:03:31.180> into

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
turned into your to the really turn into

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.930 
turned into your to the really turn into
I<00:03:31.480> think<00:03:31.630> anybody<00:03:32.080> any<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.280> NPC's<00:03:33.700> and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
I think anybody any of the NPC's and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.730 
I think anybody any of the NPC's and
ashrams<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.600> your<00:03:34.780> little<00:03:34.960> base<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.650> get

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
ashrams and your little base and you get

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.230 
ashrams and your little base and you get
basically<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.190> one-to-one<00:03:36.490> ratio<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:37.060> honor

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
basically a one-to-one ratio of honor

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.040 
basically a one-to-one ratio of honor
per<00:03:37.510> artifact

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
per artifact

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.270 
per artifact
so<00:03:38.140> that's<00:03:38.290> another<00:03:38.440> way<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.650> get<00:03:38.830> honor<00:03:38.980> if

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
so that's another way to get honor if

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.620 
so that's another way to get honor if
you're<00:03:39.580> if<00:03:39.760> your<00:03:39.880> border<00:03:40.180> kit<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.420> can<00:03:40.540> even

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
you're if your border kit you can even

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.970 
you're if your border kit you can even
do<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.780> waiting<00:03:41.020> for<00:03:41.230> BGE<00:03:41.620> cubes<00:03:41.830> if<00:03:41.920> you

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
do that waiting for BGE cubes if you

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.900 
do that waiting for BGE cubes if you
want<00:03:42.160> to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
want to

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.060 
want to
I<00:03:43.080> think<00:03:44.080> Bee<00:03:44.170> Gees<00:03:44.350> are<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.530> best<00:03:44.710> way<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.890> do

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
I think Bee Gees are the best way to do

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.160 
I think Bee Gees are the best way to do
it<00:03:45.160> for<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.670> gear<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.120> for<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.540> honor<00:03:46.690> now

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
it for the gear and for the honor now

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.680 
it for the gear and for the honor now
once<00:03:47.710> you're<00:03:47.830> starting<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.250> crew<00:03:49.210> some<00:03:49.480> honor

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
once you're starting to crew some honor

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.480 
once you're starting to crew some honor
points<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.530> won't<00:03:50.680> know<00:03:50.770> what<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.920> buy<00:03:51.040> first

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
points you won't know what to buy first

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.390 
points you won't know what to buy first
so<00:03:51.820> always<00:03:52.440> hands-down<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.800> best<00:03:54.070> thing<00:03:54.370> to

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
so always hands-down the best thing to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.820 
so always hands-down the best thing to
buy<00:03:54.610> first<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.210> your<00:03:55.390> weapon<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.960> this<00:03:56.590> could

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
buy first is your weapon and this could

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.830 
buy first is your weapon and this could
apply<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.100> conquest<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.180> haven't<00:03:58.600> looked

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
apply to conquest to I haven't looked

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.300 
apply to conquest to I haven't looked
yet<00:03:58.990> I'd<00:03:59.200> literally<00:03:59.500> just<00:03:59.620> logged<00:03:59.920> in<00:04:00.100> I

haven't seen if the conquest weapons

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.290 
haven't seen if the conquest weapons

that you want to get there are two
things<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:32.050> think<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:32.620> it's<00:04:32.860> probably<00:04:33.010> best

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
things I think that it's probably best

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.830 
things I think that it's probably best
to<00:04:33.370> make<00:04:33.550> sure<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.910> fill<00:04:34.150> your<00:04:34.600> two

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
to make sure that you fill your two

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.770 
to make sure that you fill your two
trinkets<00:04:35.260> lots<00:04:35.500> with<00:04:36.240> PvP<00:04:37.240> trinkets<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:37.660> the

trinkets lots with PvP trinkets and the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.480 
trinkets lots with PvP trinkets and the
reason<00:04:38.020> for<00:04:38.170> that<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.440> they<00:04:38.800> have<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:38.920> set<00:04:39.160> just

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
reason for that is they have a set just

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.120 
reason for that is they have a set just
a<00:04:39.520> two<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.880> two<00:04:40.090> set<00:04:40.300> bonus<00:04:40.570> where<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.530> take<00:04:41.830> 10%

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
a two a two set bonus where you take 10%

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.770 
a two a two set bonus where you take 10%
less<00:04:42.580> damage<00:04:42.850> from<00:04:42.880> players<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.270> ends<00:04:43.720> up

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
less damage from players that ends up

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.740 
less damage from players that ends up
being<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:44.110> big<00:04:44.320> deal<00:04:44.350> in<00:04:44.800> PvP<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.940> I<00:04:46.270> would<00:04:46.630> say

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
being a big deal in PvP so I would say

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.270 
being a big deal in PvP so I would say
weapons<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.290> then<00:04:47.470> fill<00:04:47.740> out<00:04:47.830> your<00:04:47.920> trinkets

and then for the third little things to
get<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.470> would<00:04:50.770> recommend<00:04:51.040> getting<00:04:51.160> your<00:04:51.250> two
