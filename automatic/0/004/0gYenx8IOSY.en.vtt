different but there are getting plenty

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
different but there are getting plenty
of<00:01:58.320> reps<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.740> no<00:01:58.829> one's<00:01:59.009> complaining<00:01:59.369> about

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.969 
of reps and no one's complaining about
that<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:01.740> situation

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that so I think it's a good situation

that so I think it's a good situation
for<00:02:02.369> everybody<00:02:02.700> we're<00:02:03.600> able<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.140> more

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

risks<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> get<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.550> able<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.209> learn<00:02:09.629> more<00:02:09.869> on

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
