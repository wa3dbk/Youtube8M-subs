00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
going to show you the function so the

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.649 
going to show you the function so the
nice<00:00:36.680> thing<00:00:36.920> about<00:00:36.949> this<00:00:37.220> is<00:00:37.489> it's<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:38.000> looper

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
nice thing about this is it's a looper

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.770 
nice thing about this is it's a looper
made<00:00:39.589> for<00:00:39.829> guitarists<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:40.879> not<00:00:41.300> got<00:00:41.449> fancy

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
made for guitarists it's not got fancy

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.180 
made for guitarists it's not got fancy
presets<00:00:42.350> or<00:00:42.530> anything<00:00:42.710> like<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:42.920> it's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
presets or anything like that it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.880 
presets or anything like that it's
purely<00:00:43.489> designed<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:45.290> just<00:00:45.500> stick<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:45.829> your

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
purely designed to just stick on your

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.229 
purely designed to just stick on your
pedal<00:00:46.129> would<00:00:46.280> not<00:00:46.430> take<00:00:46.610> up<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.850> lot<00:00:46.879> of<00:00:47.000> space

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
pedal would not take up a lot of space

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.560 
pedal would not take up a lot of space
and<00:00:47.479> be<00:00:47.600> easy<00:00:47.719> to<00:00:47.899> use<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.589> it's<00:00:48.739> basically

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
and be easy to use so it's basically

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.840 
and be easy to use so it's basically
one-stop<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:51.259> start<00:00:51.830> recording<00:00:52.040> once<00:00:52.580> again

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
one-stop to start recording once again

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.240 
one-stop to start recording once again
start<00:00:53.150> looping<00:00:53.299> the<00:00:53.540> light<00:00:53.689> goes<00:00:53.930> green

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
start looping the light goes green

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.229 
start looping the light goes green
whenever<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.339> want<00:00:55.460> overdub<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.970> just<00:00:56.119> hit

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
whenever you want overdub you just hit

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.969 
whenever you want overdub you just hit
it<00:00:56.330> again<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.989> light<00:00:57.140> goes<00:00:57.350> red<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.799> it<00:00:57.890> will

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
it again the light goes red and it will

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.619 
it again the light goes red and it will
blink<00:00:58.220> every<00:00:58.519> time<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.970> gets<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.330> end<00:00:59.479> of

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
blink every time it gets to the end of

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.439 
blink every time it gets to the end of
the<00:00:59.689> loop<00:01:00.610> tap<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.729> again<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.150> it<00:01:02.210> will<00:01:02.269> stop

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
the loop tap it again and it will stop

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.549 
the loop tap it again and it will stop
the<00:01:02.540> overdub<00:01:02.809> when<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:02.989> feel<00:01:03.199> free<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.409> play

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
the overdub when you feel free to play

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.190 
the overdub when you feel free to play
over<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.799> top<00:01:04.009> double<00:01:04.670> tap<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.879> stop<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.810> it

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
over the top double tap to stop and it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.660 
over the top double tap to stop and it
will<00:01:06.229> just<00:01:06.470> flash<00:01:06.680> nice<00:01:07.250> thing<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.520> when

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
will just flash nice thing is when

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.490 
will just flash nice thing is when
you're<00:01:07.759> playing<00:01:07.939> if<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.720> hold<00:01:08.930> it<00:01:09.020> down<00:01:09.079> you

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
you're playing if you hold it down you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.800 
you're playing if you hold it down you
can<00:01:09.950> undo<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:10.640> redo<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.299> last<00:01:11.479> loop<00:01:11.689> you

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
can undo and redo the last loop you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.030 
can undo and redo the last loop you
recorded<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.470> makes<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.829> little<00:01:12.890> bit

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
recorded so it makes it a little bit

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.730 
recorded so it makes it a little bit
more<00:01:13.280> dynamic<00:01:13.810> five<00:01:14.810> minutes<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.290> recording

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
more dynamic five minutes of recording

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.700 
more dynamic five minutes of recording
time<00:01:15.770> nice<00:01:16.579> little<00:01:16.939> loop<00:01:17.240> level<00:01:17.710> all

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
time nice little loop level all

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.620 
time nice little loop level all
true-bypass<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.759> what<00:01:20.270> you're<00:01:20.360> gonna<00:01:20.450> see

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
true-bypass and what you're gonna see

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.730 
true-bypass and what you're gonna see
what<00:01:20.750> I'm<00:01:20.810> gonna<00:01:20.899> do<00:01:21.020> first<00:01:21.229> thing<00:01:21.470> I'm<00:01:21.649> going

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
to go through just a quick demo just

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.060 
to go through just a quick demo just
showing<00:01:24.229> features<00:01:24.620> now<00:01:24.770> I'm<00:01:24.830> gonna<00:01:24.920> do

another one we've got a couple of the TC

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.780 
another one we've got a couple of the TC
electronic<00:01:27.110> pedals<00:01:27.440> plugged<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.100> just

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
electronic pedals plugged in and just

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.190 
electronic pedals plugged in and just
going<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.030> run<00:01:29.180> through<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.420> fairly<00:01:29.750> simple

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
going to run through a fairly simple

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.170 
going to run through a fairly simple
just<00:01:30.260> loop<00:01:30.890> just<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.550> get<00:01:31.670> an<00:01:31.760> idea<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:32.120> the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
just loop just so you get an idea of the

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.940 
just loop just so you get an idea of the
sort<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.420> things<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:32.990> do<00:01:33.170> all<00:01:33.740> in

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
sort of things that you can do all in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.920 
sort of things that you can do all in
all<00:01:34.070> really<00:01:34.340> good<00:01:34.640> looper<00:01:35.060> really<00:01:35.540> good<00:01:35.659> value

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
all really good looper really good value

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.990 
all really good looper really good value
for<00:01:35.960> money<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:37.070> real<00:01:37.310> contender<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.909> the
