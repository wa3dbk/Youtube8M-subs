00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.020
 together we have today even a lenovo y 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.000
 580 for you one of the moment 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.340
 most popular devices simply because here 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.250
 so much in terms of performance 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.900
 on mirror power gets for relative 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.029
 So little money compared to some 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 other manufacturers and the moment that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.930
 just wanted to be a bit more specific 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 look and let's start catching 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.820
 with the display cover on because come 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.439
 very many ask if they really alu 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.170
 whether that is just an alu optic or 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.309
 like that and I have to say honestly in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'm not quite that evening 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 So here it feels a little bit 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.469
 the art still a bit 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.540
 So how is probably just as 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.860
 a government on it the whole 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.230
 just then the leaves look 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 company open from the feeling just 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 but aluminum is completely alu 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.950
 I do not think in the form of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.489
 Noises and everything goes rather from 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.680
 plastic from so on continue with the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.390
 Links on the left side we have 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.879
 have the kensington lock at the very back 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 then this giant air opening so 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.180
 there is a huge cooling system behind it 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.939
 because just synonymous appropriate hardware 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.830
 it is therefore to be a gtx 660 now 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.820
 in there and to the processor after two vga 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 connection, of course, a lan connection 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 hdmi is also there 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 and even usb twice more to 3.0, 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 the left side from the front we have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 first a series of status leds 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 that was short pictures to show that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.920
 once a led if the touchpad 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.409
 turned off this is the leftmost 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.729
 next to it the battery indicator of the battery is charged 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.470
 The power indicator will expire 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.240
 Activity indicator and I think that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.979
 The caps lock display off caps or not 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 otherwise we only have the sd card 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.369
 Simply press slot once 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.649
 then you can find this dummy here 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.750
 Remove then just the SD card 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.760
 to use 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.230
 then on the right side here 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.810
 we once after the headset and 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.370
 Microphone connection through here also with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.440
 two separate connections instantaneous 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.240
 trend goes to the combination connection 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.090
 a combined connections here 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.420
 both still single then we still have 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.040
 once usb 2 0 the connection for the tv 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.850
 tuner because the tv tuners here 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.080
 in the end too 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.780
 that just has a corresponding 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 antenna connection for that, of course 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.000
 drive and again a usb 2.0 and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 ultimately the power connection so 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.610
 the electricity connection is on the back 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.040
 not second to the hinges the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.010
 Not enough space for the battery for two days 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.660
 connections of the bottom also relative 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.940
 sober so me once in the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.800
 Air intake fan same here again 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.370
 In addition, this allows you to finish 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.320
 can pull 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.090
 and just this big maintenance flap 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.580
 that you have the possibility of old interior 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.560
 So speak hard disk memory 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.760
 and so on , we show 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.070
 We'll take a closer look later 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.450
 once inside , unfortunately, at least 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.330
 from my point of view again a reflecting 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.260
 display is always a bit 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.120
 a matter of taste 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.890
 The device is also available for this 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.739
 example with full hd display and everything 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.140
 So there's something deep again 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.510
 selection options the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.830
 palm rest there you have to be here 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.440
 really aluminum completely installed 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.420
 So this outer fringe were now 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.250
 completely everything made of metal is noticeable 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.019
 directly when touched totally cold here 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.830
 so all what in plastic for 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.790
 example does not have the speakers 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.890
 pretty good visible from jbl 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.140
 So sound system should be in there for 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.430
 appropriate sound can provide yes 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.920
 the powerknopf the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.319
 yes this novo but how should you in the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.700
 run mostly panic button, the quasi 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.230
 the system recovery so there 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.299
 Press on it or 40 immediately 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.769
 Restore manufacturer's option 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.950
 and then you can just there accordingly 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.920
 the option off if you need it here 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.049
 once again the video mode the device from 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.400
 special video mode will follow that 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.109
 display is changed a bit from 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.719
 the colors and all that it is 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.310
 optimal for video presentation is 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.870
 a hundred times one more key around all mute 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.379
 to switch that really no gate 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.509
 out comes the keyboard and in 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.030
 above this chiclet design with the 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.109
 slightly rounded keys otherwise from 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.050
 of stability 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.759
 yes, there are really strong pressures 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.919
 There is a little bit of something to do with it 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.720
 religious area of ​​the optical 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.650
 drive that unfortunately must 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.580
 weak points in the area of 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.009
 number block but sum must be annoying 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.960
 I think if you just notice that 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.190
 you start where and where a piece 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.560
 that's not really the case 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.539
 stable is here, for example, here one looks 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.849
 as it bends under light pressure the 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.229
 complete keyboard through and that is 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.120
 of course that can be really annoying 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.539
 write yourself if this is then 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.039
 tattoo members 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.289
 otherwise we still have a large touchpad 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.360
 now also a bit let in so 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.830
 a piece milled out that one just 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.990
 also noted the difference when looking at 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.190
 the touchpad is the keys are too 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.470
 integrated again and have 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.960
 left and right click everything completely in 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.979
 a piece is natural 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.930
 taste thing as well or not 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.250
 johnston does not give them much anymore 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.979
 So the whole leds and as I said 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.280
 everything just up here he is relative 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.870
 free and what will be forgotten in the beginning 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.810
 of course that was to belong 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.840
 that comes to me once again 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.930
 natural battery in the case with 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.060
 6700 milliamp hours 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.680
 Should or where you are around 45 hours 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.340
 of course, depending on usage 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.850
 different is the power supply 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.020
 of course, so it is relatively large 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.530
 that goes to it any appropriate performance 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.150
 So we need a mainz now 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.789
 05 06 ampere 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:56.759
 yes I have anything has watt to 120 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:58.770
 The last time I pampered one thumb 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.690
 short manual so otherwise setup and 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.340
 just such a small one 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.960
 user manual just for the whole 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.479
 key assignment as far as that explains 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.280
 that rather not so recovery dvd 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:14.039
 Again, not so much for 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.560
 ipad apps i lon 580 and we will be you 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.810
 but still show how a sata ssd 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.699
 built in and the whole world as 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.250
 , equipment, possibilities are that but 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.580
 in a separate video then until the 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.580
 next time
