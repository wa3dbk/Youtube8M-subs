00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
definitely high enough

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.660 
definitely high enough
that<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.590> even<00:02:08.330> even<00:02:09.330> memory<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.110> huge<00:02:10.670> huge

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that a even even memory with huge huge

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.820 
that a even even memory with huge huge
heat<00:02:11.880> sinks<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.300> top<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.630> them<00:02:13.910> are<00:02:14.910> not<00:02:15.240> issued

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
heat sinks on top of them are not issued

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.370 
heat sinks on top of them are not issued
so<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> basically<00:02:17.550> got<00:02:18.270> real<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.080> cable

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
so now I basically got real good cable

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.610 
so now I basically got real good cable
management<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.190> through<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:21.720> lot

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
management going up through here a lot

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.550 
management going up through here a lot
better<00:02:22.800> setup<00:02:23.130> than<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.340> had<00:02:23.490> before<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.960> this

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
better setup than I had before so this

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.820 
better setup than I had before so this
is<00:02:25.590> there's<00:02:26.400> no<00:02:28.010> get<00:02:29.010> air<00:02:30.590> going<00:02:31.590> through<00:02:31.620> this

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
is there's no get air going through this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.050 
is there's no get air going through this
case<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:33.960> like<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> suction<00:02:34.530> when<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> try

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
case it's it's like a suction when I try

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
case it's it's like a suction when I try
taking<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.470> cover<00:02:37.470> off<00:02:37.590> which<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:37.980> kind<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
taking the cover off which is kind of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.800 
taking the cover off which is kind of
where<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.670> funk

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.080 

that's<00:02:43.470> pretty<00:02:43.620> slick<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> play<00:02:44.550> you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
I do make another video that will be

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.860 
I do make another video that will be
what<00:03:59.900> I<00:03:59.930> make<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.320> up<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.120> VI<00:04:02.299> affinity

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
what I make it up is there a VI affinity

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.470 
what I make it up is there a VI affinity
on<00:04:02.989> that<00:04:03.140> 5870<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.820> hope<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.209> like<00:04:05.360> the

on that 5870 so I hope you like the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
changes I did to my setup here mainly

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.809 
changes I did to my setup here mainly
did<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:09.709> make<00:04:10.160> sure<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.670> system

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.810 

has<00:04:14.359> a<00:04:14.390> long<00:04:15.070> happy<00:04:16.070> life<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:18.639> think<00:04:19.639> it<00:04:19.699> will

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
has a long happy life I think it will

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.150 
has a long happy life I think it will
now<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:21.049> just<00:04:21.169> because<00:04:21.530> overclocking<00:04:22.039> that

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
now and just because overclocking that

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.189 
now and just because overclocking that
memory<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.520> mean<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.880> was<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.090> only<00:04:23.270> issue

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
memory I mean that was the only issue

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.659 
memory I mean that was the only issue
was<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.740> heat<00:04:24.889> that<00:04:25.070> was<00:04:25.160> coming<00:04:25.400> off<00:04:25.520> the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
was the heat that was coming off the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.719 
was the heat that was coming off the
memory<00:04:26.289> overclocking<00:04:27.289> ain't<00:04:27.560> gig<00:04:27.770> well<00:04:28.520> guess

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
memory overclocking ain't gig well guess

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.120 
memory overclocking ain't gig well guess
what<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.970> don't<00:04:29.180> have<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.479> issue<00:04:29.630> no<00:04:29.870> more

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
what I don't have that issue no more

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.080 
what I don't have that issue no more
this<00:04:31.130> thing<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.430> kind<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.669> nice<00:04:31.789> because<00:04:31.940> it

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
this thing is kind of nice because it

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.320 
this thing is kind of nice because it
has<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.240> low<00:04:32.479> and<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> high<00:04:33.849> setting<00:04:34.849> on<00:04:34.970> as<00:04:35.210> you

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
has a low and a high setting on as you

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.610 
has a low and a high setting on as you
can<00:04:35.449> see<00:04:35.599> it<00:04:35.720> gets<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.930> lot<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.080> riders<00:04:36.320> our

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
can see it gets a lot of riders our

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.080 
can see it gets a lot of riders our
second<00:04:36.919> long<00:04:37.070> power<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.699> really<00:04:37.910> don't

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
second long power but you really don't

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.969 
second long power but you really don't
need<00:04:38.270> anything<00:04:38.539> more<00:04:38.690> than<00:04:38.930> low<00:04:39.139> especially

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
need anything more than low especially

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.640 
need anything more than low especially
with<00:04:40.460> Dad<00:04:40.900> hundred<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:41.990> twenty<00:04:42.229> millimeter
