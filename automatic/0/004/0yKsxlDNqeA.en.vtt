00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.750 
noted to lift up Milner however that was
in<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.430> sort<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> flashback<00:00:39.719> comic<00:00:40.290> special<00:00:41.280> so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
in a sort of flashback comic special so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
in a sort of flashback comic special so
I'm<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> count<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
I'm not really going to count that as a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.119 
I'm not really going to count that as a
pickup<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.480> did<00:00:45.780> vision<00:00:46.200> lift<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.649> Milner

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
pickup so how did vision lift up Milner

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.220 
pickup so how did vision lift up Milner
as<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.969> he<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.180> an<00:00:48.329> Android<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.110> he

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
as you know he is an Android and so he

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
as you know he is an Android and so he
has<00:00:49.350> no<00:00:49.590> tangible<00:00:50.250> emotion<00:00:50.850> however<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.690> film

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
has no tangible emotion however the film

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139 
has no tangible emotion however the film
sort<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.289> contradicts<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.370> he<00:00:53.699> does<00:00:53.910> show

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
sort of contradicts that as he does show

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
sort of contradicts that as he does show
a<00:00:54.180> motion<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.870> Ultron<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> human<00:00:56.340> beings

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
a motion for Ultron and human beings

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.959 
a motion for Ultron and human beings
there<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> been<00:00:58.140> androids<00:00:58.800> who<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.609> lifted

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there have been androids who have lifted

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.510 
there have been androids who have lifted
Milner<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> past<00:01:00.690> notably<00:01:01.530> Gabriel<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
Milner in the past notably Gabriel the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
Milner in the past notably Gabriel the
air<00:01:02.699> Walker<00:01:02.969> who<00:01:03.539> wizard<00:01:03.840> Android<00:01:04.260> Herald<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
air Walker who wizard Android Herald to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.510 
air Walker who wizard Android Herald to
Galactus<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> thought<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.159> sort<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
Galactus so I thought think that sort of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.840 
Galactus so I thought think that sort of
gives<00:01:08.729> him<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.780> alibi<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.590> also<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> mad

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
gives him an alibi and also the mad

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
gives him an alibi and also the mad
thinkers<00:01:12.330> awesome<00:01:12.840> Android<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.590> also<00:01:13.799> been

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
thinkers awesome Android has also been

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670 
thinkers awesome Android has also been
noted<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> pick<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.790> Milner<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
noted to pick up Milner so I have a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
noted to pick up Milner so I have a
quote<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.549> internet<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.630> are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
quote here from the internet there are

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
quote here from the internet there are
two<00:01:18.960> possible<00:01:19.439> interpretations<00:01:20.030> one<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
two possible interpretations one is that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
two possible interpretations one is that
the<00:01:21.509> noble-hearted<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.500> young<00:01:22.680> vision<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the noble-hearted and young vision is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
the noble-hearted and young vision is
deemed<00:01:23.520> worthy<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> hammer<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.320> other

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
deemed worthy of the hammer the other

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.070 
deemed worthy of the hammer the other
which<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.220> consistent<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.270> Milner<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
which is consistent in the way Milner is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
which is consistent in the way Milner is
written<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> comics<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:30.000> since

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
written in the comics is that since

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.240 
written in the comics is that since
vision<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> sentient<00:01:31.680> artificial

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
vision is a sentient artificial

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
vision is a sentient artificial
life-form<00:01:32.939> he<00:01:33.210> simply<00:01:33.659> isn't<00:01:33.900> bound<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
life-form he simply isn't bound to the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.940 
life-form he simply isn't bound to the
enchantment<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:36.299> since<00:01:36.720> he<00:01:36.900> isn't<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.439> living

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
enchantment now since he isn't a living

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.840 
enchantment now since he isn't a living
form<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.700> course<00:01:39.270> he<00:01:39.479> can't<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.990> subject<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
form of course he can't be subject to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
form of course he can't be subject to
magic<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.140> could<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
magic and so I think that could be a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
magic and so I think that could be a
possible<00:01:44.310> reason<00:01:44.369> why<00:01:45.270> he<00:01:45.540> could<00:01:45.810> possibly

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
possible reason why he could possibly

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.889 
possible reason why he could possibly
lift<00:01:46.950> Milne<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> comic<00:01:48.210> books<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
lift Milne in the comic books and the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.370 
lift Milne in the comic books and the
movies<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.759> other<00:01:50.970> reason<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.810> he<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
movies and the other reason that he is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.609 
movies and the other reason that he is
suggested<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.159> Noble<00:01:53.579> hearted<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.149> young

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
suggested to be Noble hearted and young

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.810 
suggested to be Noble hearted and young
this<00:01:55.619> could<00:01:55.860> actually<00:01:55.979> suggest<00:01:56.520> why<00:01:56.640> he's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
this could actually suggest why he's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.719 
this could actually suggest why he's
been<00:01:56.969> deemed<00:01:57.240> worthy<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.990> Thor<00:01:58.469> also<00:01:59.009> sort<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
been deemed worthy as Thor also sort of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
been deemed worthy as Thor also sort of
