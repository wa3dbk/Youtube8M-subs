00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.480
 the nasa 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.820
 in the minute 2 hours 19 minutes 56 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 seconds of this video while the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.350
 louis cameras recorded appear 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.960
 several lights and many have ventured 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.960
 say that it is a UFO fleet 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.660
 ellis while the camera gets worse 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.150
 every time it gets darker 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.210
 until in the minute 2 hours 15 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.880
 minutes 49 seconds the screen will 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 it turns blue and returns again in the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.640
 minute 2 hours 17 minutes 33 seconds 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.070
 issues like massive UFO fleet are 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.620
 directs to the ground or massive fleet of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.720
 UFOs recorded by ellis are themes that 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.090
 they listen on the internet and talk about it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.170
 because the nasa has not given reason on 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.020
 this matter 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.939
 [Music] 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.429
 to be able to find a possible 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.679
 answer to this video the first thing that 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.439
 we did is something that we believe no one has 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.350
 done and is to read the description of the video 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.569
 presented by the nasa where he explains 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.899
 what happens in the video and this is your 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.899
 version 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 the video includes internal shots and views 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.000
 from the earth at other times the video 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 It is also accompanied by an audio of the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.960
 conversations between the crew and the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 control of the sword mission of faf arena 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.740
 Petric is close to the Lord to 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.740
 go ahead 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.430
 this video is only available when 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.930
 the space station is in contact 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.569
 with the floor 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.579
 during the loss of the signal by a 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.980
 At this moment viewers will be able to see a 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:27.819
 blue screen that has the station 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.370
 orbital to ground every 90 minutes is 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.980
 experience a sunrise or sunset 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.980
 sun about every 45 minutes 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.830
 when the station is in the dark 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.160
 the external video camera can 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.440
 appear in black but sometimes you can 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.710
 provide spectacular views of 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.770
 rays or lights of the city 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.320
 then the nasa if it gives an explanation and 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.560
 according to this the lights that appear in the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.960
 video can belong to a city and 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.360
 the movement that they appear to present 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.960
 it's the lights but the ihss that 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.960
 keeps moving 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.540
 At the end we have the answer presented 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.390
 by NASA and the other theory that 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.760
 propose about a fleet that goes to 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.250
 the earth 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.250
 which of these two believe is a decision of 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.000
 you in the end is in our opinion 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.440
 Video judge for yourself 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.190
