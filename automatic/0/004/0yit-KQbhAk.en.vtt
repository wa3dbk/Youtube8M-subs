00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
connection to this person who not only

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.890 
connection to this person who not only
changed<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.250> face<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.519> music<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.450> really

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
changed the face of music but really

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.619 
changed the face of music but really
lived<00:02:42.260> at<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.590> time<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.730> know<00:02:43.849> just<00:02:44.000> across

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
lived at a time you know just across

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.800 
lived at a time you know just across
that<00:02:45.110> change<00:02:45.590> into<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.040> 20th<00:02:46.489> century<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:47.150> time

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
that change into the 20th century a time

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.530 
that change into the 20th century a time
that<00:02:48.170> changed<00:02:48.620> all<00:02:48.829> of<00:02:48.860> our<00:02:49.099> lives<00:02:49.540> forever

that changed all of our lives forever

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.309 
that changed all of our lives forever
and<00:02:51.019> I<00:02:51.500> think<00:02:51.769> everything<00:02:52.069> about<00:02:52.640> Mahler

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
and I think everything about Mahler

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.190 
and I think everything about Mahler
embodies<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.909> change<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.540> excitement

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
embodies that change and that excitement

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.949 
embodies that change and that excitement
and<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.709> terror<00:02:58.129> about<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.390> new<00:02:59.599> century

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and that terror about the new century

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.739 
and that terror about the new century
coming<00:03:00.470> up
