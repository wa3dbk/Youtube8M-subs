00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
Bella: Jake,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.680
I love you.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.880
So please,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.840
Don't make me choose.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.040
Cause it'll be him.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800
It's always been him.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.040
Jacob: Bella,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.920
Edward: Goodbye, Jacob

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.420
Jacob: No, you don't speak for her!

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520
Edward: Bella, get out of here.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.100
Bella: Stop!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180
Stop!

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540
You can't hurt each other without hurting me!

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080
Jake..

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.160
Edward: He's right.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
You shouldn't become what I am.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.940
Bella: I can't do this alone.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.180
Edward: Then please just wait.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.160
Just give me...five years.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.240
Bella: That's too long.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.580
Edward: Then three.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580
You're so stubborn.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.060
Bella: What are you waiting for?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.020
Edward: I have one...condition.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.260
If you want me to do it myself.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.440
Bella: What's the condition?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.880
Edward: And then forever.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.920
Bella: That's what I'm asking.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.860
Edward: Marry me, Bella.
