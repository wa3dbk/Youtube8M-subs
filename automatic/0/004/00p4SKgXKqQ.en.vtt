part<00:01:54.910> in<00:01:55.090> my<00:01:55.240> opinion<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.050> make<00:01:56.200> macaroons<00:01:56.619> is

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
part in my opinion to make macaroons is

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.130 
part in my opinion to make macaroons is
getting<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.670> right<00:01:57.850> consistency<00:01:58.300> for<00:01:59.080> the

getting the right consistency for the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.249 
getting the right consistency for the
batter<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.210> are<00:02:01.450> looking<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.050> bad

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
consistency like this when the batter

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.669 
consistency like this when the batter
drops<00:02:06.190> down<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:07.240> bowl<00:02:07.479> which<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:08.289> settle

I<00:02:31.940> prefer<00:02:32.799> smaller<00:02:33.799> macaroons<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:34.849> they

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
I prefer smaller macaroons because they

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.759 
I prefer smaller macaroons because they
are<00:02:35.180> easier<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:35.720> cook<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:36.470> don't<00:02:36.620> take

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
are easier to cook and they don't take

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.670 
are easier to cook and they don't take
us<00:02:36.950> all<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:37.760> they<00:02:38.510> will<00:02:38.720> still<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.200> that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
us all so they will still have that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.470 
us all so they will still have that
beautiful<00:02:40.010> color<00:02:40.459> you're<00:02:40.819> looking<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.299> in<00:02:41.450> a

the<00:03:59.859> butter<00:04:00.209> about<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.239> tablespoon<00:04:01.989> at<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.139> time

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
the butter about a tablespoon at a time

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.379 
the butter about a tablespoon at a time
and<00:04:02.590> that's<00:04:03.310> how<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.549> make<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.000> butter<00:04:04.180> cream

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
and that's how you make the butter cream

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.530 
and that's how you make the butter cream
basically<00:04:04.989> at<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:06.129> end<00:04:06.209> after<00:04:07.209> we're<00:04:07.389> done

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
basically at the end after we're done

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.089 
basically at the end after we're done
adding<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.959> butter<00:04:08.109> I'm<00:04:08.409> just<00:04:08.709> going<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:08.950> add

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
adding the butter I'm just going to add

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.429 
adding the butter I'm just going to add
in<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.730> green<00:04:10.000> tea<00:04:10.239> paste<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.750> mix<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.260> and

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.219 
that's our fun cream for the macaron
filling<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.790> these<00:04:15.970> are<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.479> Finnish<00:04:16.780> macaron

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
shells and I am going to line them up

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.930 
shells and I am going to line them up
based<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:20.109> sizing<00:04:20.590> just<00:04:20.919> pair<00:04:21.220> them<00:04:21.370> up<00:04:21.489> with<00:04:21.549> a

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.110 

for<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:43.440> recipe<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:44.040> actually<00:04:44.640> don't<00:04:44.880> need

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
for this recipe we actually don't need

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.150 
for this recipe we actually don't need
to<00:04:45.300> mature<00:04:45.690> their<00:04:45.840> macaroons<00:04:46.230> because<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.980> is
