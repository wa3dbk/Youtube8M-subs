that's supposed to be kept alive that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
that's supposed to be kept alive that's
just<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> common<00:01:55.799> sense<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.969> want

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
just kind of common sense but you want

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
just kind of common sense but you want
to<00:01:57.180> make<00:01:57.270> sure<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.630> doesn't<00:01:57.869> happen<00:01:58.020> also

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to make sure that doesn't happen also

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.490 
to make sure that doesn't happen also
besides<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.899> achievement<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
besides that this this achievement is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.749 
besides that this this achievement is
really<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.040> hard<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.670> said

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
really not that hard to do as I said

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
really not that hard to do as I said
before<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.350> more

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
before it can be a little bit more

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.359 
before it can be a little bit more
healing<00:02:04.799> intensive

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
healing intensive

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
healing intensive
because<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.090> having<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.479> war<00:02:06.689> mage<00:02:06.840> up

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
because you are having this war mage up

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
because you are having this war mage up
with<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> entire<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.459> entire<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:09.030> guess<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
with the entire the entire I guess a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.740 
with the entire the entire I guess a
second<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.229> third<00:02:10.259> main<00:02:10.890> phase<00:02:11.129> whatever<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
second or third main phase whatever and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850 
second or third main phase whatever and
so<00:02:12.930> either<00:02:13.110> way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so either way

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.500 
so either way
least<00:02:13.980> until<00:02:14.250> he's<00:02:14.370> down<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.790> almost<00:02:15.180> 20

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
least until he's down at like almost 20

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.330 
least until he's down at like almost 20
30<00:02:15.990> percent<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:16.470> something<00:02:16.620> again<00:02:16.890> whenever

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
30 percent or something again whenever

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
30 percent or something again whenever
he<00:02:17.520> goes<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.880> second<00:02:18.240> transition<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:19.050> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
he goes into a second transition and so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.540 
he goes into a second transition and so
it<00:02:19.380> can<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.740> healing<00:02:19.920> its<00:02:20.130> own<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.460> you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
it can be healing its own so if you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.400 
it can be healing its own so if you
might<00:02:20.760> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.060> bring<00:02:21.210> an<00:02:21.330> extra<00:02:21.510> healer<00:02:21.900> or

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
might want to bring an extra healer or

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.240 
might want to bring an extra healer or
you<00:02:22.560> might<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.860> want<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.070> people

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you might just want to have people

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.980 
you might just want to have people
really<00:02:23.520> paying<00:02:23.790> attention<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.780> get

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
really paying attention so if you get

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.530 
really paying attention so if you get
the<00:02:25.140> fix<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.500> buff<00:02:25.710> zero<00:02:26.580> zero<00:02:26.850> right<00:02:26.940> there<00:02:27.000> has

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the fix a buff zero zero right there has

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
the fix a buff zero zero right there has
a<00:02:27.570> fix<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.080> buff<00:02:28.290> he's<00:02:28.500> supposed<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.800> get<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.190> of

a fix a buff he's supposed to get out of
the<00:02:29.430> raid<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.480> arcane<00:02:31.170> mages

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
the raid and so the the arcane mages

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.040 
the raid and so the the arcane mages
arcane<00:02:31.830> bolts<00:02:32.160> only<00:02:32.400> hit<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:32.970> player<00:02:33.270> Cleo

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
arcane bolts only hit one player Cleo

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.530 
arcane bolts only hit one player Cleo
just<00:02:34.410> got<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.740> fix<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.340> buff<00:02:35.580> right<00:02:35.820> there<00:02:36.030> he's

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
just got the fix a buff right there he's

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.270 
just got the fix a buff right there he's
a<00:02:36.570> he's<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> melee<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:37.800> even<00:02:38.100> more

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
a he's a melee so it's even more

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.680 
a he's a melee so it's even more
important<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:38.760> him<00:02:38.910> look<00:02:39.120> at<00:02:39.210> him<00:02:39.300> he's<00:02:39.450> out

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
important for him look at him he's out

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.020 
important for him look at him he's out
doing<00:02:40.380> what<00:02:40.620> he's<00:02:40.740> supposed<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.220> doing<00:02:41.520> so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
doing what he's supposed to be doing so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.490 
doing what he's supposed to be doing so
that's<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.840> need<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.020> have<00:02:43.110> everybody

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
that's what you need to have everybody

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.230 
that's what you need to have everybody
doing<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.370> doesn't<00:02:44.670> increase<00:02:44.910> raid

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
doing and so it doesn't increase raid

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.030 
doing and so it doesn't increase raid
damage<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.230> again<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.709> have<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
damage and so again you just have to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.470 
damage and so again you just have to
have<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.250> war<00:02:47.459> mage<00:02:47.670> up<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> entire

have this war mage up for the entire
time<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.170> hard<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.430> that

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
time it's not that hard it's not that

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
replication and so at this point I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.949 
replication and so at this point I
called<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.340> kill<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.640> war<00:03:35.790> mage<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.840> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
going to be the hardest part in the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.560 
going to be the hardest part in the
fight<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:38.730> handling<00:03:39.150> all<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
fight here is handling all of the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.320 
fight here is handling all of the
anomalies<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.650> extra<00:03:41.040> warm<00:03:41.250> age<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.820> then

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
anomalies the extra warm age and then

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.570 
anomalies the extra warm age and then
also<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.930> two<00:03:43.590> warm<00:03:43.799> ages<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.280> already

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
also the two warm ages that already

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.250 
also the two warm ages that already
spawn<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.720> might<00:03:45.930> be<00:03:46.080> where<00:03:46.230> you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
spawn and so this might be where you

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.560 
spawn and so this might be where you
want<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.590> pop<00:03:46.769> heroism<00:03:47.100> as<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.910> said<00:03:48.090> before<00:03:48.209> we

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
want to pop heroism as I said before we

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.060 
want to pop heroism as I said before we
already<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.320> very<00:03:49.590> good<00:03:49.799> group<00:03:50.040> here

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
already we have a very good group here

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.830 
already we have a very good group here
and<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.790> we<00:03:50.910> didn't<00:03:51.150> feel<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.299> we<00:03:51.510> needed<00:03:51.690> to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
and so we didn't feel that we needed to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840 
and so we didn't feel that we needed to
wait<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:52.440> if<00:03:52.980> your<00:03:53.160> group<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.670> just

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
wait for it but if your group is just

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.310 
wait for it but if your group is just
kind<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.239> ragtag<00:03:54.660> group<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:55.080> you're<00:03:55.170> just
