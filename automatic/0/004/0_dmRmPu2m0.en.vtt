to me
in<00:00:06.380> surfing<00:00:06.859> at<00:00:06.950> the<00:00:06.979> time<00:00:07.510> the<00:00:08.510> Alea<00:00:08.780> was<00:00:09.110> the

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
in surfing at the time the Alea was the

in surfing at the time the Alea was the
ultimate<00:00:09.500> thing<00:00:10.220> because<00:00:10.700> it<00:00:10.850> it<00:00:11.420> was<00:00:11.600> if<00:00:11.780> the

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
ultimate thing because it it was if the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.420 
ultimate thing because it it was if the
play<00:00:12.080> is<00:00:12.200> the<00:00:12.290> ultimate<00:00:12.650> surfboard<00:00:13.100> head

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
play is the ultimate surfboard head

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.129 
play is the ultimate surfboard head
straight<00:00:13.730> straight<00:00:14.120> up<00:00:14.269> is<00:00:14.390> the<00:00:14.510> fastest<00:00:14.990> as

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
straight straight up is the fastest as

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.929 
straight straight up is the fastest as
the<00:00:15.260> bet<00:00:15.410> cusp<00:00:15.680> back<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:16.160> brides<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.550> deepest

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
the bet cusp back to brides the deepest

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.790 
the bet cusp back to brides the deepest
totally<00:00:17.840> focused<00:00:18.230> on<00:00:18.320> that<00:00:18.380> but<00:00:18.650> almost

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
totally focused on that but almost

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.710 
totally focused on that but almost
nobody<00:00:19.070> can<00:00:19.369> ride<00:00:19.520> in<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:19.730> layout<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.539> then<00:00:20.690> I

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
nobody can ride in the layout so then I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.650 
nobody can ride in the layout so then I
made<00:00:20.960> that<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:22.520> foam<00:00:22.789> boards<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.420> make<00:00:23.539> it

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
made that the the foam boards to make it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.090 
made that the the foam boards to make it
easier<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.110> get<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:24.350> same<00:00:24.619> sort<00:00:24.859> of<00:00:24.920> feeling

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
easier to get that same sort of feeling

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.830 
easier to get that same sort of feeling
and<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:25.430> almost<00:00:25.699> get<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.090> same<00:00:26.330> feeling<00:00:26.570> but

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
and you almost get the same feeling but

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.779 
and you almost get the same feeling but
it's<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:26.990> lot<00:00:27.080> easier<00:00:27.440> to<00:00:27.560> ride<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.520> now<00:00:28.640> it's

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
it's a lot easier to ride and now it's

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.939 
it's a lot easier to ride and now it's
the<00:00:28.880> belly<00:00:29.090> boards<00:00:29.510> I<00:00:29.689> have<00:00:30.199> actually<00:00:30.560> had<00:00:30.920> a

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
can see now all over the place there's

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
Polonia wood and there's a Leia's and so

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.859 
Polonia wood and there's a Leia's and so
yeah<00:01:25.039> it<00:01:25.099> worked<00:01:25.579> now<00:01:25.969> that<00:01:26.209> was<00:01:26.359> probably<00:01:26.539> the

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
yeah it worked now that was probably the

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.809 
yeah it worked now that was probably the
most<00:01:27.259> successful<00:01:27.439> surfboard<00:01:28.369> movement<00:01:28.729> in

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
most successful surfboard movement in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.179 
most successful surfboard movement in
modern<00:01:28.939> times<00:01:29.779> was<00:01:30.229> they<00:01:30.499> had<00:01:30.619> taken<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.950> fins

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
modern times was they had taken the fins

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.769 
modern times was they had taken the fins
off<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.609> riding<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.179> little<00:01:32.270> flat<00:01:32.569> piece<00:01:32.599> of

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
off and riding a little flat piece of

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.989 
off and riding a little flat piece of
wood<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.289> then<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.219> spin-offs<00:01:34.789> from

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
wood and then all the spin-offs from

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.690 
wood and then all the spin-offs from
that<00:01:35.179> there<00:01:35.359> are<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:35.810> much<00:01:36.229> change<00:01:37.189> in

surfboard design and you can see it here
at<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.299> bottom<00:01:41.599> of<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.719> festival<00:01:42.229> how<00:01:42.649> much

at the bottom of a festival how much
it's<00:01:43.069> changed<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.609> Alaia<00:01:43.849> has<00:01:44.329> made<00:01:44.479> an

it's changed and the Alaia has made an

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.809 
it's changed and the Alaia has made an
enormous<00:01:44.659> impact<00:01:45.499> nobody<00:01:46.310> nobody<00:01:46.579> talks

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
enormous impact nobody nobody talks

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.489 
enormous impact nobody nobody talks
about<00:01:46.969> it<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:47.299> much<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:47.929> obvious<00:01:48.319> there

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
about it so much but it's obvious there

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.739 
about it so much but it's obvious there
it<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.709> then<00:01:49.700> what<00:01:49.789> good<00:01:49.999> surfboards<00:01:50.569> didn't

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
it is then what good surfboards didn't

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.859 
it is then what good surfboards didn't
look<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:50.899> this<00:01:51.169> seven<00:01:51.770> years<00:01:51.950> ago<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
look like this seven years ago with the

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.649 
look like this seven years ago with the
surf<00:01:54.109> art<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.770> surfboard<00:01:55.369> with<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.389> Alea

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
surf art and the surfboard with the Alea

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.479 
surf art and the surfboard with the Alea
it's<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:57.499> instantaneous

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
it's it's instantaneous

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.199 
it's it's instantaneous
it's<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.479> very<00:02:00.169> individualistic<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.369> hla<00:02:02.059> it

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
it's a very individualistic the hla it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.779 
it's a very individualistic the hla it
has<00:02:02.389> to<00:02:02.539> be<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.659> custom<00:02:03.289> surfboard<00:02:03.679> for<00:02:04.520> you

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
has to be a custom surfboard for you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.089 
has to be a custom surfboard for you
because<00:02:05.209> they're<00:02:05.359> so<00:02:05.630> hard<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:05.989> ride<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.919> you

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
because they're so hard to ride that you

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.859 
because they're so hard to ride that you
have<00:02:07.309> to<00:02:07.489> have<00:02:07.639> the<00:02:07.819> best<00:02:08.060> board<00:02:08.300> possible<00:02:08.750> or

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
have to have the best board possible or

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.419 
have to have the best board possible or
you<00:02:08.899> probably<00:02:09.440> won't<00:02:09.649> be<00:02:09.739> able<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:09.979> do<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.250> and

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
you probably won't be able to do it and

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.250 
you probably won't be able to do it and
then<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.090> second<00:02:11.420> thing<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.569> you<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.110> could

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
then the second thing is you you could

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.740 
then the second thing is you you could
shape<00:02:12.469> an<00:02:12.650> Alea<00:02:12.890> burn<00:02:13.549> your<00:02:13.819> art<00:02:14.030> into<00:02:14.329> it<00:02:14.569> and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
shape an Alea burn your art into it and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.670 
shape an Alea burn your art into it and
take<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.930> surfing

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
take it surfing

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.229 
take it surfing

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
in about a four hour time period and

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.520 
in about a four hour time period and
then<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:17.689> now<00:02:17.870> they're<00:02:18.109> they're<00:02:18.349> burning

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530
