each get to pick three colours while
blindfolded<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.600> let's<00:00:42.809> start

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:57.969 

I<00:01:54.820> was<00:01:55.820> really<00:01:56.300> really<00:01:56.450> bad<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.990> wanted<00:01:57.770> to

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
I was really really bad I wanted to

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.160 
I was really really bad I wanted to
apply<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.430> night<00:01:58.700> before<00:01:59.119> trying<00:01:59.630> on<00:01:59.840> my<00:01:59.960> hair

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
apply the night before trying on my hair

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.450 
apply the night before trying on my hair
so<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.590> color<00:02:00.800> will<00:02:00.979> be<00:02:01.130> more<00:02:01.310> natural

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
so that the color will be more natural

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.930 
so that the color will be more natural
but<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.660> damaging<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.500> dry<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.400> finger<00:02:04.790> I

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
but it is so damaging so dry so finger I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.919 
but it is so damaging so dry so finger I
just<00:02:05.150> couldn't<00:02:05.450> take<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.720> anymore<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.500> can<00:02:07.130> -

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929
