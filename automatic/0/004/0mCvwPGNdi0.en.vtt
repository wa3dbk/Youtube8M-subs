finally my fourth semester in nursing

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510 
finally my fourth semester in nursing
school<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> did<00:00:33.750> apply<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> CNA<00:00:34.680> job<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
school I did apply for a CNA job but I

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.950 
school I did apply for a CNA job but I
didn't<00:00:36.000> end<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.270> getting<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.660> callback

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
didn't end up getting a callback

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.049 
didn't end up getting a callback
probably<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> graduate

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
probably because I was about to graduate

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
probably because I was about to graduate
and<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.780> would<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.140> pointless<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.739> train

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and it would be like pointless to train

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
and it would be like pointless to train
me<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.219> seeing<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
me to be seeing it right so when I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
me to be seeing it right so when I
started<00:00:43.770> practicing<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> nurse<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.820> would

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
started practicing as a nurse I would

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
we'd clean up a patient changed their
sheets<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.289> were<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.620> quick<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
sheets and they were so quick and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
sheets and they were so quick and
efficient<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:51.090> top<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
efficient on top of it and I was

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.319 
efficient on top of it and I was
standing<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.070> frozen<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> deer<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
standing there all frozen like a deer in

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.630 
standing there all frozen like a deer in
headlights<00:00:54.360> wondering<00:00:55.199> why<00:00:55.980> does<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> take<00:00:56.489> me

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
headlights wondering why does it take me

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
headlights wondering why does it take me
like<00:00:56.789> 20<00:00:57.300> minutes<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.660> change<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> don't

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
like 20 minutes to change in it don't

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.180 
like 20 minutes to change in it don't
breathe

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
breathe

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
breathe
oh<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.410> don't<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
oh it's because I don't have the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
oh it's because I don't have the
hospital<00:01:02.250> experience<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
hospital experience that they have and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
hospital experience that they have and
during<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.739> process<00:01:04.949> who<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
during this process who would have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.370 
during this process who would have
thought<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.090> moving<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> trash<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.110> close

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
thought that moving the trash can close

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.350 
thought that moving the trash can close
to<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.650> bed<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.100> throw<00:01:08.280> things<00:01:08.490> away<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:09.330> be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to the bed to throw things away would be

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
to the bed to throw things away would be
such<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> great<00:01:10.170> idea

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
such a great idea

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.830 
such a great idea
instead<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.670> throwing<00:01:12.180> them<00:01:12.299> across<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
instead of like throwing them across the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
instead of like throwing them across the
room<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.409> basketball<00:01:14.010> player<00:01:14.450> it's
