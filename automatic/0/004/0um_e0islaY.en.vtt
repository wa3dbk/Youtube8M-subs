have been doing a lot of damage to her
centaurs<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.519> did<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.269> point<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.750> damage<00:00:30.779> when

she attacked my unit and then another

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
she attacked my unit and then another
three<00:00:33.899> points<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.350> damage<00:00:34.530> when<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> attacked

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
three points of damage when I attacked

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.110 
three points of damage when I attacked
her<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.300> my<00:00:36.570> arches<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:38.070> normal<00:00:38.309> battle<00:00:38.820> we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
her with my arches in a normal battle we

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
her with my arches in a normal battle we
would<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.360> resolved<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.989> attacks<00:00:40.320> damage

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
would have resolved an attacks damage

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
would have resolved an attacks damage
immediately<00:00:41.160> rather<00:00:41.910> than<00:00:42.180> waiting<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
immediately rather than waiting to do it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
immediately rather than waiting to do it
all<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.320> one<00:00:43.530> time<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.370> done<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.579> these

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
all at one time as we have done in these

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.630 
all at one time as we have done in these
videos<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.320> resolve<00:00:46.620> each<00:00:46.980> attacks

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
videos so i will resolve each attacks

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.990 
videos so i will resolve each attacks
damage<00:00:48.210> separately<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> Centaur<00:00:50.700> unit

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
damage separately when the Centaur unit

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840 
damage separately when the Centaur unit
attacked<00:00:51.449> my<00:00:51.780> infantry<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.890> did<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.340> point

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
attacked my infantry they did one point

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.619 
attacked my infantry they did one point
of<00:00:54.090> damage<00:00:54.379> each<00:00:55.489> infantry<00:00:56.489> figure<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:57.239> one

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of damage each infantry figure has one

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.229 
of damage each infantry figure has one
peg<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> bottom<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.280> each<00:00:59.550> figure<00:00:59.969> takes

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
peg on the bottom so each figure takes

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
peg on the bottom so each figure takes
one<00:01:00.539> point<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.170> damage<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.620> kill<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
one point of damage to kill as the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060 
one point of damage to kill as the
unit's<00:01:03.149> controller<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> choose<00:01:04.739> which

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
unit's controller I get to choose which

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.640 
unit's controller I get to choose which
figure<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.700> remove<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.930> careful<00:01:07.380> choosing

which<00:01:08.130> figure<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> remove<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.900> unit

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
which figure to remove because your unit

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
which figure to remove because your unit
will<00:01:10.470> immediately<00:01:10.799> lose<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> capabilities

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
will immediately lose the capabilities

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.649 
will immediately lose the capabilities
of<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.600> position<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.460> will<00:01:14.460> remove<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
of that position I will remove this

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660 
of that position I will remove this
figure<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.680> since<00:01:16.920> i<00:01:17.040> am<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.369> close

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
position the injury travels with it if

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.870 
position the injury travels with it if
the<00:02:19.050> figure<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.470> not<00:02:19.740> killed<00:02:20.100> during<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.610> turn

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the figure is not killed during the turn

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.330 
the figure is not killed during the turn
that<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.510> took<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> damage<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.830> die<00:02:23.070> is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that it took the damage the die is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.170 
that it took the damage the die is
removed<00:02:24.560> my<00:02:25.560> arches<00:02:25.980> attack<00:02:26.430> did<00:02:26.760> three

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
removed my arches attack did three

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.800 
removed my arches attack did three
points<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.900> damage<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.760> apply<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
points of damage I have to apply the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.810 
points of damage I have to apply the
damage<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> figure<00:02:31.800> wounded<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.550> last

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.410 
damage to the figure wounded in the last
attack<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.530> point<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.130> damage<00:02:35.160> kills<00:02:36.090> that

figure the remaining two points of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.690 
figure the remaining two points of
damage<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.810> will<00:02:40.080> apply<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.650> figure<00:02:41.040> which

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
damage I will apply to this figure which

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.479 
damage I will apply to this figure which
kills<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.209> as<00:02:42.330> well<00:02:42.750> when<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.070> figures<00:02:44.310> of

it's time to press my attack if you want

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.350 
it's time to press my attack if you want
to<00:03:01.290> learn<00:03:01.410> how<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.650> achieve<00:03:01.800> victory<00:03:02.520> see<00:03:03.090> the
