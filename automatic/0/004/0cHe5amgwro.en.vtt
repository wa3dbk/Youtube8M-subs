00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
arc up here when I turn it on you know

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
arc up here when I turn it on you know
how<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:13.310> little<00:01:14.360> burst<00:01:15.619> they're

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
how they have that little burst they're

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
how they have that little burst they're
known<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> turn<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.360> Muller<00:01:18.689> door

a<00:01:19.350> couple<00:01:20.040> other<00:01:20.159> ones<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.150> per<00:01:21.330> X<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a couple other ones do that and per X I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.149 
a couple other ones do that and per X I
think<00:01:22.430> but<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.090> hear<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
think but you can actually hear that

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.960 
think but you can actually hear that
it's<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> boost<00:01:29.610> switch<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:31.970> which

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it's got a boost switch right here which

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.740 
it's got a boost switch right here which
actually<00:01:33.210> adds<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:36.090> pops<00:01:36.420> -

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
actually adds a little bit of it pops -

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
actually adds a little bit of it pops -
first<00:01:37.110> cuz<00:01:37.320> you're<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.799> changing<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
first cuz you're actually changing the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.960 
first cuz you're actually changing the
bias<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> preamp<00:01:40.110> tube<00:01:40.640> which<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> going

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
bias on the preamp tube which is going

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
bias on the preamp tube which is going
through<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.450> capacitors<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.560> built

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
through some capacitors that have built

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.899 
through some capacitors that have built
up<00:01:44.040> charge<00:01:48.049> very<00:01:49.049> nice<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.590> amp<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.100> pretty

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
up charge very nice little amp is pretty

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.789 
up charge very nice little amp is pretty
much<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> beefed<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.409> champ<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:54.799> tweed

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
mojo power transformer and a Hammond

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:53.059 
mojo power transformer and a Hammond
over<00:02:49.919> here<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.370> Hammond<00:02:51.290> output<00:02:52.290> transformer

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
over here the Hammond output transformer

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.220 
over here the Hammond output transformer
down<00:02:53.250> there

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
down there

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.039 
down there
got<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:56.459> very<00:02:56.730> quiet<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.450> boost

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
got the it's very quiet when the boost

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.349 
got the it's very quiet when the boost
isn't<00:02:58.500> on<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:01.230> such<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> simple<00:03:01.980> amp<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:03.150> is

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
isn't on it's such a simple amp this is

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.569 
isn't on it's such a simple amp this is
like<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> treble<00:03:04.109> boost<00:03:04.349> right<00:03:04.650> here<00:03:05.219> and<00:03:05.459> then

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
like a treble boost right here and then

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.259 
like a treble boost right here and then
this<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.969> a<00:03:06.000> phat<00:03:06.359> boost<00:03:06.659> they<00:03:06.930> call<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:08.239> such<00:03:09.239> a

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
this is a phat boost they call it such a

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.080 
this is a phat boost they call it such a
simple<00:03:09.870> amp<00:03:10.169> that<00:03:11.239> there's<00:03:12.239> are<00:03:12.450> only<00:03:14.090> very

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
simple amp that there's are only very

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.289 
simple amp that there's are only very
short<00:03:15.180> path<00:03:15.690> from<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.199> guitar<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.799> the

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
short path from the guitar to the

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.270 
short path from the guitar to the
speaker's<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.540> signal<00:03:18.900> path<00:03:19.139> all<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.069> wires

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
speaker's the signal path all the wires

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.170 
speaker's the signal path all the wires
are<00:03:20.430> very<00:03:20.579> short<00:03:21.889> it's<00:03:22.889> very<00:03:23.159> simple<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:23.909> and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
are very short it's very simple so and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.899 
are very short it's very simple so and
it<00:03:24.329> should<00:03:24.599> sound<00:03:24.810> great<00:03:25.109> next<00:03:25.919> video<00:03:26.310> will<00:03:26.609> be

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
it should sound great next video will be

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.119 
it should sound great next video will be
in<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.389> cabinet<00:03:27.870> which<00:03:28.079> hopefully<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.470> get<00:03:28.709> it

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
in the cabinet which hopefully I get it

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.689 
in the cabinet which hopefully I get it
hopefully<00:03:29.849> I'll<00:03:29.970> get<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.389> in<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.659> week<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:31.109> so

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:34.699 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.090 

I'll<00:03:35.699> be<00:03:35.909> back
