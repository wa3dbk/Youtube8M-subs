00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 it's time to unravel the mysteries 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.029
 from Internet 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.910
 congratulations earthlings 40 years ago 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.670
 that the man did a fantastic deed 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 the first trip to the moon but who said 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 that man stepped on the moon 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 It's all a great nation It's what they stand for 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.550
 the supporters of the conspiracy theory 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.539
 conspiracyists point to a series of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.390
 evidence of fraud 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.510
 we separate the most outstanding 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.590
 first the flag is more famous as 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 she trembled 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 if there is no wind on the moon another shadows 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 how can they point to directions 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.079
 different and have also different 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.960
 if the only light source is the sun and 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.690
 end temperatures like the astronauts 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 supported 100 degrees celsius during the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 day and less than 150 at night is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:02.879
 too much wrong is impossible 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:08.520
 believe in the name of the story here between 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.409
 first virtual detective action 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 Flag as there is no wind on the moon 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.880
 that maintains the open flag this think 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.080
 who at the top and who said that the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.729
 trembling flag 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 it only moved when it was handled 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.500
 by the astronaut the very movement that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.689
 twisted the course to put the flag 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 in the background he sink flag on the ground 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.220
 do the flag I fear there what is event 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 now the shadows is easy too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.619
 explained 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.020
 the uneven terrain of the moon 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 influences the shape and direction of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 shadows and they look very different 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.670
 also because there are several light sources of the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 moon beyond the light of the sun the flashes of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 astronauts for example the ground 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.869
 reflecting the sunlight also at last the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.210
 temperatures to extreme variations of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.520
 temperature on the moon but the astronauts 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.250
 landed in an area of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.590
 very hot and the cold was in a 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.170
 well chosen region they do not 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.899
 they faced no degree that way 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.329
 no less than 100 degrees 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.789
 the conspiracists have several 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.840
 other alleged evidence of fraud 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.090
 We will not stay the whole night. 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.959
 bouncing one by one but has not 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.510
 doubt 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.019
 all issues raised are 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.330
 easily explained by science 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.190
 the gadget detective shows 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.980
 now arguments to end with 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.440
 any doubt a material proof 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.660
 stones and astronauts brought 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.489
 moon were studied by scientists from the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.400
 whole world nowhere 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.420
 specialist questioned the origin 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.790
 of these rocks 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.670
 the greatest proof that the man was on the street 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.940
 only the rock samples that have been 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.420
 Why do not you start on the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.459
 surface of the earth 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.160
 another test at that time two 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.599
 superpowers lived 24 hours a day 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.730
 with an eye on each other 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.140
 the United States and the Soviet Union 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.160
 also participated in the big race 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.709
 space 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.290
 the Soviets spent millions of rubles 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.850
 spying the Americans and never 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.590
 in no time 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.540
 the Soviet Union manifested any 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.030
 doubt about the astronauts' journey 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.069
 Americans to the moon could never 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.260
 opportunity to prove to be fraud 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.769
 the Russians never doubted why I 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.060
 I'm going to doubt one of the chiefs of the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.650
 conspiracists decided to address the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.530
 second man to step on the moon 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.060
 Astronaut is the audio that lost 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.739
 patience when the guy said that he 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.260
 was a liar who had never been to the 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.530
 moon audrey turned his hand at the foot of the ear 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.940
 finally the mother of all the tests 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.549
 few people know that astronauts 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.349
 left in the floor of the moon a panel that is 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.870
 used until today works like this 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.060
 laboratories here on earth emit signals 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.660
 who travel to the moon hit the dashboard and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.160
 Return 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.380
 can you point a laser today to 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.190
 and see it closed and reflected back 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.799
 to the earth 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.049
 today the information is used without 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.739
 scientists from all over the world 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.419
 planet 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.849
 then whoever set foot on the moon was not 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.130
 the man therefore when you hear speak 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.370
 on the journey from man to moon there is no reason why 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.640
 have doubt it 's true true 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.080
 that is, the conspiracists are 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.150
 able to say no that Spanish 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.519
 there are no astronauts there are no 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.590
 Russians do not exist and the moon 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.230
 You already caught the moon as you know it. 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.230
 she exists and I them gases
