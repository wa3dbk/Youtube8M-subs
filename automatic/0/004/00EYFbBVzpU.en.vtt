it makes k cubs from Keurig these little
cups<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.300> sitting<00:00:12.300> next<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
cups like this sitting next to it is the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.730 
cups like this sitting next to it is the
Keurig<00:00:14.219> platinum<00:00:14.820> v70<00:00:15.330> model<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:16.320> model<00:00:16.650> is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
Keurig platinum v70 model my model is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.529 
Keurig platinum v70 model my model is
about<00:00:16.830> three<00:00:17.070> years<00:00:17.250> old<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:17.940> quite

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
about three years old so it's not quite

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.210 
about three years old so it's not quite
the<00:00:18.660> same<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> new<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.590> that's<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.949> but

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the same as the new one that's out but

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.609 
the same as the new one that's out but
cosmetically<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.510> identical<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.500> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
cosmetically it's identical so here you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.980 
cosmetically it's identical so here you
can<00:00:22.740> see<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.160> difference<00:00:24.060> between<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.570> two<00:00:24.720> I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
can see the difference between the two I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.060 
can see the difference between the two I
thought<00:00:25.470> it'd<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.590> good<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> give<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
thought it'd be good to give a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.259 
thought it'd be good to give a
comparison<00:00:26.640> between<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> two<00:00:27.119> models

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
comparison between the two models

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
comparison between the two models
because<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.160> direct

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
because I think that they are direct

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.450 
because I think that they are direct
competitors<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:30.150> each<00:00:30.269> other

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.139 

functionally<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.610> two<00:00:37.730> models<00:00:38.059> are

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
functionally the two models are

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.880 
functionally the two models are
identical<00:00:38.690> they<00:00:38.930> both<00:00:39.079> have<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.379> same<00:00:39.410> cup

identical they both have the same cup
sizes<00:00:40.129> that<00:00:40.640> they<00:00:40.760> can<00:00:40.910> make<00:00:41.090> same<00:00:41.930> brew

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
sizes that they can make same brew

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
the setup are identical between the two

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.160 
the setup are identical between the two
the<00:00:49.190> main<00:00:49.370> difference<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:49.879> cosmetics<00:00:50.570> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the main difference is cosmetics the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.880 
interesting at least on my b-70 although
it's<00:02:01.460> mostly<00:02:01.610> plastic<00:02:02.329> metal<00:02:03.229> handle<00:02:03.710> here

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
it's mostly plastic metal handle here

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.700 
it's mostly plastic metal handle here
that<00:02:03.920> opens<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.490> closes<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.060> metal<00:02:05.990> whereas

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
that opens and closes is metal whereas

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.919 
that opens and closes is metal whereas
the<00:02:06.950> Breville<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.399> mostly<00:02:07.670> metal<00:02:08.359> but<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
the Breville is mostly metal but the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.069 
the Breville is mostly metal but the
handle<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.799> is<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.369> plastic<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.750> I'll<00:02:11.959> have

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
handle here is is plastic so I'll have

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.840 
handle here is is plastic so I'll have
to<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.500> longevity-wise<00:02:13.040> if<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.579> holds

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
to see you longevity-wise if this holds

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.170 
to see you longevity-wise if this holds
up<00:02:13.940> as<00:02:14.060> well<00:02:14.470> might<00:02:15.470> be<00:02:15.500> 70<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.100> about<00:02:16.400> three

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180

underneath press the brew button and and

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.039 
underneath press the brew button and and
that's<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.879> if<00:03:50.090> you're<00:03:50.209> making<00:03:50.329> a<00:03:50.510> larger<00:03:50.840> Cup

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
that's it if you're making a larger Cup

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.899 
that's it if you're making a larger Cup
there<00:03:51.650> will<00:03:51.859> be<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:52.010> brief<00:03:52.519> amount<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.819> time

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
there will be a brief amount of time

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.000 
there will be a brief amount of time
where<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.239> has<00:03:53.389> to<00:03:53.569> take<00:03:54.440> water<00:03:54.620> out<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.859> the

external reservoir to fill it up and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.270 
external reservoir to fill it up and
then<00:03:56.629> heat<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:56.840> up<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.560> doesn't<00:03:57.709> take<00:03:57.950> wine<00:03:58.159> at

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
the decision so again functionally they

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.030 
the decision so again functionally they
are<00:05:23.180> identical<00:05:24.170> the<00:05:24.770> only<00:05:24.800> difference

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
even put it on top of rubber bumpers

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.020 
even put it on top of rubber bumpers
actually<00:05:55.379> to<00:05:55.560> try<00:05:55.680> to<00:05:55.770> isolate<00:05:56.370> it<00:05:56.789> from<00:05:56.940> the
