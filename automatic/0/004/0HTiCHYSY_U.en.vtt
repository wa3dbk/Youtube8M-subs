00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.290 

in<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.740> we'll<00:00:02.250> just<00:00:02.490> show<00:00:02.639> changing<00:00:03.179> a

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
in this video we'll just show changing a

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.980 
in this video we'll just show changing a
clinker<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.460> Nero<00:00:05.460> when<00:00:06.450> it's<00:00:06.600> running<00:00:06.899> on

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
clinker in the Nero when it's running on

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.970 
clinker in the Nero when it's running on
wheat<00:00:07.700> so<00:00:08.870> the<00:00:09.870> Nero<00:00:10.080> requires<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> clinker

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
wheat so the Nero requires the clinker

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.560 
wheat so the Nero requires the clinker
change<00:00:11.219> every<00:00:11.519> 12<00:00:11.790> hours<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.210> there's<00:00:12.509> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
change every 12 hours because there's a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.599 
change every 12 hours because there's a
smaller<00:00:12.900> pop<00:00:13.250> so<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:15.420> way<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
smaller pop so the way you do that is to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.759 
smaller pop so the way you do that is to
firstly<00:00:17.840> turn<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.109> turn<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> off<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> will

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
firstly turn the turn it off so it will

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.790 
firstly turn the turn it off so it will
clean<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:24.230> leftover<00:00:25.230> grain<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:25.650> in

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
clean out the leftover grain that's in

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.330 
clean out the leftover grain that's in
the<00:00:25.890> pot<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:27.230> as<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.830> time<00:00:29.099> at

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the pot and as you can see the time at

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.880 
the pot and as you can see the time at
the<00:00:29.429> moment<00:00:30.109> is<00:00:31.109> almost<00:00:31.740> 25<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.850> 6<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> I'll

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the moment is almost 25 to 6 so I'll

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
the moment is almost 25 to 6 so I'll
pause<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.520> video<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.480> come<00:00:37.350> back<00:00:37.410> when

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
pause the video and then come back when

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.389 
pause the video and then come back when
it's<00:00:37.920> ready<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.370> change<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.340> see

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it's ready to change so as you can see

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's ready to change so as you can see
it's<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.850> 2<00:00:42.360> minutes<00:00:42.570> from<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.739> turned

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it's about 2 minutes from when we turned

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:56.780 
it's about 2 minutes from when we turned
it<00:00:44.100> off

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:16.300 

just<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.570> off<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> shields

keeping a cup of a cup of cat litter for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:38.690 
keeping a cup of a cup of cat litter for
relighting<00:01:31.610> place<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> pig

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.310 

close<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.940> door<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:41.500> just<00:01:42.420> we've<00:01:43.420> got<00:01:43.660> three

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
close the door we just we've got three

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.740 
close the door we just we've got three
sector<00:01:45.100> controls<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.500> ignite<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.390> now<00:01:52.570> that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
sector controls to ignite and now that

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.350 
sector controls to ignite and now that
we<00:01:52.840> about<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.400> five-minute<00:01:54.400> wait<00:01:54.580> before<00:01:54.790> to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
we about a five-minute wait before to

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.210 
we about a five-minute wait before to
reignite<00:01:56.020> so<00:01:56.380> if<00:01:56.440> we<00:01:56.500> just<00:01:56.650> pause<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.130> video

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
reignite so if we just pause the video

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.680 
reignite so if we just pause the video
again<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.860> as<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:00.760> see<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.090> fire's<00:02:01.300> just

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
again so as you can see the fire's just

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.680 
again so as you can see the fire's just
starting<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:01.990> ignite<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.160> we've<00:02:04.150> now<00:02:04.390> at

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
starting to ignite now and we've now at

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.420 
starting to ignite now and we've now at
about<00:02:05.790> 22<00:02:06.790> minutes<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.240> 6<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:08.010> not<00:02:09.010> very<00:02:09.040> long

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
about 22 minutes to 6 so not very long

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.170 
about 22 minutes to 6 so not very long
and<00:02:10.420> that'll<00:02:10.690> go<00:02:10.840> through<00:02:11.200> an<00:02:11.320> ignition<00:02:12.180> stage

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
and that'll go through an ignition stage

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.870 
and that'll go through an ignition stage
for<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> bit<00:02:13.890> two<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:14.980> three<00:02:15.190> minutes<00:02:15.340> when

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
for a bit two or three minutes when

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.580 
for a bit two or three minutes when
it'll<00:02:16.090> actually<00:02:16.210> just<00:02:16.390> click<00:02:16.990> back<00:02:17.170> into<00:02:17.350> gear

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
it'll actually just click back into gear

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.710 
it'll actually just click back into gear
and<00:02:17.800> waves<00:02:18.370> will<00:02:18.700> go<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.150> I'll<00:02:19.300> pause<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.570> again

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
and waves will go so I'll pause it again

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.010 
and waves will go so I'll pause it again
and<00:02:20.260> show<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.280> once<00:02:21.430> fully<00:02:22.240> going<00:02:22.540> again<00:02:25.020> okay

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
and show it once fully going again okay

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.920 
and show it once fully going again okay
the<00:02:26.230> fire's<00:02:26.650> gone<00:02:26.800> through<00:02:27.220> its<00:02:27.370> ignition

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the fire's gone through its ignition

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.740 
the fire's gone through its ignition
period<00:02:28.930> now<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.820> as<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.000> can<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.450> time

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
period now and as you can see the time

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.180 
period now and as you can see the time
is<00:02:32.140> about<00:02:33.330> 17<00:02:34.330> minutes<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.720> 6<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.450> from<00:02:38.190> fully

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
is about 17 minutes to 6 so from fully

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.520 
is about 17 minutes to 6 so from fully
stopped<00:02:39.550> fully<00:02:40.240> going<00:02:40.660> you're<00:02:41.110> looking<00:02:41.380> at

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
stopped fully going you're looking at

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.300 
stopped fully going you're looking at
roughly<00:02:42.400> about<00:02:42.700> 10<00:02:43.060> minutes<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:45.130> for

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
roughly about 10 minutes and what for

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.940 
roughly about 10 minutes and what for
the<00:02:45.370> click<00:02:45.580> once<00:02:46.209> you've<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.590> pot<00:02:47.770> back

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
the click once you've put the pot back

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.110 
the click once you've put the pot back
in<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.190> don't<00:02:48.310> need<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.670> stand<00:02:48.850> around<00:02:49.000> and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
in you don't need to stand around and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.690 
in you don't need to stand around and
watch<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:49.930> automatically

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
watch it it's just automatically

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.370 
watch it it's just automatically
controls<00:02:51.700> itself<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.300> goes<00:02:52.840> back<00:02:53.050> into<00:02:53.200> those

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
controls itself and goes back into those

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.520 
controls itself and goes back into those
settings<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> pot<00:02:55.810> that's<00:02:55.989> came<00:02:56.290> out

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
settings so the pot that's came out

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.920 
settings so the pot that's came out
that's<00:02:56.680> come<00:02:56.950> out<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.340> with<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.300> clinker

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
that's come out of it with the clinker

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.300 
that's come out of it with the clinker
and<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.140> normally<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.650> leave<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
and it normally you just leave that and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.130 
and it normally you just leave that and
tip<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> bit<00:03:01.360> later<00:03:01.570> when<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.810> cools<00:03:02.050> down

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
tip it up a bit later when it cools down

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.949 
tip it up a bit later when it cools down
but<00:03:03.000> we'll<00:03:04.000> tip<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.300> out<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.510> here<00:03:04.600> just<00:03:04.840> to

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
but we'll tip it out in here just to

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.229 
but we'll tip it out in here just to

makings of a clinker there that's the
that's<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> shape<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.130> clinker<00:03:20.460> and<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
that's the shape of the clinker and the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.410 
that's the shape of the clinker and the
what<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.560> lighter<00:03:22.800> colored<00:03:23.160> material<00:03:24.000> is

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
what the lighter colored material is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.230 
what the lighter colored material is
that<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.020> cat<00:03:25.200> litter<00:03:25.380> which<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.740> use<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
that is the cat litter which you use to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.910 
that is the cat litter which you use to
light<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.690> that's<00:03:27.780> that's<00:03:28.650> always<00:03:28.800> a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
light it with and that's that's always a

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.920 
light it with and that's that's always a
star<00:03:29.310> see<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:29.940> one's<00:03:30.120> broken<00:03:30.390> quite<00:03:30.720> easily

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
star see this one's broken quite easily

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.430 
star see this one's broken quite easily
because<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.530> been<00:03:32.520> in<00:03:32.640> there<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:32.970> probably

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
because it's been in there for probably

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.820 
because it's been in there for probably
three<00:03:34.440> years<00:03:34.650> or<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:36.560> effectively<00:03:37.560> that's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
three years or so but effectively that's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.380 
three years or so but effectively that's
all<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.100> need<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.370> do<00:03:39.110> twice<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> day<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:41.390> keep

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
all you need to do twice a day to keep

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.300 
all you need to do twice a day to keep
the<00:03:42.510> stove<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.680> very<00:03:44.070> simple

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the stove going so it's a very simple

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.260 
the stove going so it's a very simple
operation<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:46.140> when<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:46.470> running<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:47.270> on

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
operation and when it's running on on

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.330 
operation and when it's running on on
the<00:03:48.780> crushed<00:03:49.290> olive<00:03:49.590> pizza<00:03:49.890> or<00:03:50.010> pallets

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
the crushed olive pizza or pallets

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.210 
the crushed olive pizza or pallets
there's<00:03:50.610> not<00:03:51.450> even<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.750> need<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.230> do<00:03:53.070> that

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
there's not even that need to do that

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.180 
there's not even that need to do that
because<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.670> has<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.270> self-cleaning<00:03:55.190> mechanism

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
because it has a self-cleaning mechanism

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.060 
because it has a self-cleaning mechanism
because<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.489> doesn't<00:03:56.760> require<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:58.070> clinker

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
because it doesn't require the clinker

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.720 
because it doesn't require the clinker
to<00:03:59.280> to<00:04:00.090> operate<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.130> following<00:04:02.310> video

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
to to operate so in the following video

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.080 
to to operate so in the following video
I'll<00:04:03.030> show<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.510> running<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:04.610> crushed<00:04:05.610> old<00:04:05.820> pits

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
I'll show it running on crushed old pits

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.680 
I'll show it running on crushed old pits
and<00:04:07.640> everybody<00:04:08.640> can<00:04:08.790> see<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.360> difference

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and everybody can see the difference

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.229
