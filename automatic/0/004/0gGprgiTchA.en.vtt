 Map 2010 Germany vs Austria thirteenth sixth of 2010 are Ganzi 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.269
 since St Kenzie scared Daisy as Hank a goal video 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.509
 on the thirteenth sixth of 2010, it comes in the first round to the meeting 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.419
 Germany against Austria and my tip is the training will be this first game 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.659
 win 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.440
 Germany is of course a strong team 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.150
 but will have problems 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.860
 to be able to face the Oscar-nominated 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.490
 therefore, there are few goals and at the end of the game, the coach has to win one 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.230
 zero 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.900
 Austria has made no sweet progress in football and is 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.909
 no longer the football dwarf 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.240
 as he was always mocked 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.690
 most of the Australian national team play in England 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.480
 Football and will be able to adjust very well to the German game 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.220
 Germany has always known at World Championships 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.710
 Kriminalamt on difficulties and therefore becomes the first match against OSC Lille 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.980
 awarded 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 Germany will probably be the winner in the next match against Serbia 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.659
 In my opinion, England will become football world champion 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.980
 the English are relocated and also have a great team 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.600
 Of course, this is not excluded 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.610

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.090
 Brazil played only average football Germany 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.730
 but that is not excluded 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.170
 the whole of Germany will become football world champion 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.659
 because you are capable 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.570
 to increase from game to game 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.720
