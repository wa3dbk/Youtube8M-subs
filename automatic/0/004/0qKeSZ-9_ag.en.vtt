 I think the notes were not good 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.080
 placed is a song that maybe 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.810
 I do not know what your teachers have told you or 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.700
 your choreographer but you can be in 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.110
 one position and try to do 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.340
 feel to people what is 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.200
 saying the song what are you 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.360
 singing that's what you have to work 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.870
 more because already the voice if you have it 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.390

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.400
 that or the parties 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.410
 the song is a very sad song 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.220
 laura pausini is a very interpreter 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.770
 difficult to sing you moved much better 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.170
 but what happened that I did not feel and really 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.820
 I tried to cry but it did not happen 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.310
 because there was not this connection of 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.290
 singer with the audience you have the voice 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.530
 you have the talent now you have to 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.690
 learn to connect with your audience to 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.490
 granier what is the verdict luis 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.490
 Colonel of vote you give to Niger 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.200

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.840
 a little bit that you know that I 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.940
 I want a lot but 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.100
 this color because I want it to be a challenge 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.930
 so ok 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.820
 ok one red one green 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.450
 The act you decide 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.260
 you are a singer before working in the 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.260
 interpretation 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.480
 he is waiting for the final decision 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.430
 but you know something michelle the juries 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.770
 they do this because they know that you can 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.260
 give more and what they want is for you to be 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.590
 a great singer says that you're going to 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.910
 achieve true 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.350
