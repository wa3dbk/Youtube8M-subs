00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
the biggest difference that I noticed

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.800 
the biggest difference that I noticed
was<00:02:41.770> just<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> way<00:02:42.430> people<00:02:42.460> were<00:02:43.030> playing<00:02:43.270> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
was just the way people were playing and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.580 
was just the way people were playing and

way people were playing call of duty
ghosts<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.410> opposed<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.400> way<00:03:06.520> people<00:03:06.550> are

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
ghosts as opposed to the way people are

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.380 
ghosts as opposed to the way people are
playing<00:03:07.180> titanfall<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:10.120> know<00:03:10.240> it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
playing titanfall is just you know it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.330 
playing titanfall is just you know it
was<00:03:10.510> very<00:03:10.780> noticeable<00:03:11.080> just<00:03:11.800> very

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
was very noticeable just very

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.160 
was very noticeable just very
lackadaisical<00:03:13.060> play<00:03:13.990> styles<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.960> really

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
lackadaisical play styles and it really

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.840 
lackadaisical play styles and it really
just<00:03:17.260> made<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> game<00:03:17.830> unplayable<00:03:18.250> cuz<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
just made the game unplayable cuz you

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.400 
just made the game unplayable cuz you
guys<00:03:19.000> know<00:03:19.150> me<00:03:19.300> like<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:19.840> ghosts<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
guys know me like I like ghosts for the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.770 
guys know me like I like ghosts for the
most<00:03:20.620> part<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:20.950> think<00:03:20.980> it's<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.400> pretty<00:03:21.780> well

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
most part I think it's a pretty well

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.950 
most part I think it's a pretty well
balanced<00:03:23.290> game<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:24.760> course<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.360> maps<00:03:25.630> right

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
balanced game of course the maps right

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.020 
balanced game of course the maps right
you<00:03:26.530> know<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.770> math<00:03:26.980> everybody<00:03:27.520> agrees<00:03:28.000> that

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
you know the math everybody agrees that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.510 
you know the math everybody agrees that
the<00:03:28.360> maps<00:03:28.600> are<00:03:28.750> too<00:03:28.960> big<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.620> they

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
the maps are too big and that they

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.850 
the maps are too big and that they
deviate<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.300> way<00:03:31.600> too<00:03:31.660> much<00:03:32.290> from<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
deviate it way too much from the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.320 
deviate it way too much from the
classical<00:03:33.610> quality<00:03:34.180> map<00:03:34.570> design<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.880> uh<00:03:36.910> you

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
classical quality map design but uh you

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.570 
classical quality map design but uh you
know<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:38.320> way<00:03:38.440> people<00:03:38.590> were<00:03:38.830> playing<00:03:39.040> just

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
know the way people were playing just

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.330

sitting back Thermal scopes on deck I

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.160 
sitting back Thermal scopes on deck I
that<00:03:42.580> stuff<00:03:42.760> usually<00:03:42.940> doesn't<00:03:43.420> bother<00:03:43.600> me<00:03:43.780> but

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170
