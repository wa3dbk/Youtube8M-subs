ninety-nine<00:04:47.700> point<00:04:47.970> nine<00:04:48.120> nine<00:04:48.300> percent

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
ninety-nine point nine nine percent

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.620 
ninety-nine point nine nine percent
chance<00:04:49.320> right<00:04:49.680> there<00:04:50.090> destroy<00:04:51.090> these<00:04:51.360> cells

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
chance right there destroy these cells

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.740 
chance right there destroy these cells
yeah<00:04:52.320> just<00:04:52.680> accept<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.220> move<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.760> whatever<00:04:54.360> we

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
yeah just accept it move on whatever we

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.310 
yeah just accept it move on whatever we
got<00:04:55.310> okay<00:04:56.310> do<00:04:56.730> I<00:04:57.030> think<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.420> ghosts<00:04:57.810> being<00:04:58.110> is

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
got okay do I think that ghosts being is

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.230 
got okay do I think that ghosts being is
fast-paced<00:04:58.650> as<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.160> you<00:04:59.370> will<00:04:59.490> see<00:04:59.700> more<00:04:59.970> of

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
fast-paced as it is you will see more of

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.050 
fast-paced as it is you will see more of
one<00:05:01.050> AR<00:05:01.320> three<00:05:01.680> SMG<00:05:02.190> or<00:05:02.400> will<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.580> stay<00:05:02.910> the

the<00:05:12.510> game<00:05:12.690> I'm<00:05:13.110> running<00:05:13.500> with<00:05:13.650> different

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
the game I'm running with different

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.070 
the game I'm running with different
weapons<00:05:14.160> because<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.790> course<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.840> know<00:05:15.960> if

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
weapons because of course you know if

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.620 
weapons because of course you know if
you<00:05:16.200> were<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.710> AAR<00:05:17.520> player<00:05:17.790> for<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.090> past<00:05:18.360> two

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
you were a AAR player for the past two

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.880 
you were a AAR player for the past two
or<00:05:18.660> three<00:05:18.780> call<00:05:19.169> of<00:05:19.290> duty's<00:05:19.500> then<00:05:19.740> you're

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
or three call of duty's then you're

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.800 
or three call of duty's then you're
obviously<00:05:20.040> going<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.490> attempt<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.180> run<00:05:21.419> an<00:05:21.540> AR

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
obviously going to attempt to run an AR

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.290 
obviously going to attempt to run an AR
first<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.640> probably<00:05:23.640> will<00:05:23.760> change<00:05:24.030> for<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
first it probably will change for a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.230 
first it probably will change for a
couple<00:05:24.540> people<00:05:24.720> but<00:05:25.410> with<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.950> being<00:05:25.980> as<00:05:26.850> fast

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
couple people but with it being as fast

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.440 
couple people but with it being as fast
pace<00:05:27.450> as<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:28.050> will<00:05:28.320> probably<00:05:28.800> see<00:05:29.120> one<00:05:30.120> AR

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
pace as it is I will probably see one AR

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.480 
pace as it is I will probably see one AR
three<00:05:31.230> sm<00:05:31.500> juice<00:05:31.680> that's<00:05:31.950> that's<00:05:32.280> what<00:05:32.400> I'm

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
three sm juice that's that's what I'm

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.640 
three sm juice that's that's what I'm
assuming<00:05:32.880> but<00:05:33.030> again<00:05:33.240> like<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.570> said<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:34.140> all

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
assuming but again like I said it all

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.400 
assuming but again like I said it all
really<00:05:34.860> depends<00:05:35.340> on<00:05:35.720> how<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.780> game<00:05:37.080> is<00:05:37.260> when

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
really depends on how the game is when

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.409 
really depends on how the game is when
it<00:05:37.500> comes<00:05:37.710> out<00:05:37.919> upon<00:05:38.370> release<00:05:38.550> what<00:05:39.180> teams

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
it comes out upon release what teams

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.880 
it comes out upon release what teams
stay<00:05:39.660> together<00:05:39.810> there<00:05:40.230> are<00:05:40.320> always<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.620> bunch

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
stay together there are always a bunch

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.260 
stay together there are always a bunch
of<00:05:40.980> team<00:05:41.190> changes<00:05:41.610> as<00:05:41.760> soon<00:05:41.910> as<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.090> game<00:05:42.240> is

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
of team changes as soon as the game is

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.150 
of team changes as soon as the game is
released<00:05:42.600> which<00:05:43.410> I<00:05:43.590> never<00:05:43.650> really<00:05:44.130> understood

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
released which I never really understood
