I<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.500> why<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.340> does<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.880> pop<00:01:27.210> up

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I do not know why this does not pop up

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
I do not know why this does not pop up
first<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> app<00:01:28.110> switcher<00:01:28.590> normally<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
first in the app switcher normally but I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
first in the app switcher normally but I
think<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.030> something<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.479> Apple<00:01:31.200> should

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
think it was something that Apple should

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
think it was something that Apple should
