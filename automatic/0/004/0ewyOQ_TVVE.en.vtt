between<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.960> pump<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.920> filter<00:00:46.340> I'm

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
between the pump and the filter I'm

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.640 
between the pump and the filter I'm
going<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.240> be<00:00:47.300> putting<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:47.720> right<00:00:47.990> about<00:00:48.230> here

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.950 

the<00:00:51.650> outline<00:00:52.610> should<00:00:52.970> be<00:00:53.090> after<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.600> filter

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
the outline should be after the filter

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.840 
the outline should be after the filter
and<00:00:54.170> after<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.560> heater<00:00:54.770> if<00:00:55.040> you<00:00:55.070> have<00:00:55.400> one<00:00:55.700> it

and after the heater if you have one it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.310 
and after the heater if you have one it
goes<00:00:56.030> where<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.239> water<00:00:56.570> is<00:00:56.690> added<00:00:57.080> directly

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
goes where the water is added directly

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.020 
goes where the water is added directly
back<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.070> pool<00:00:58.310> without<00:00:58.580> going<00:00:58.970> through

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
back to the pool without going through

wrap it on the larger male thread of the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.040 
wrap it on the larger male thread of the
check<00:01:07.729> valve<00:01:07.760> that's<00:01:08.300> when<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.660> can<00:01:08.810> hear<00:01:08.990> a

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050

just<00:01:44.990> your<00:01:45.170> hand<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:47.240> next<00:01:47.480> step<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.900> slip

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
just your hand the next step is to slip

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.350 
just your hand the next step is to slip
a<00:01:48.200> compression<00:01:48.710> nut<00:01:49.070> over<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> piece<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.090> the

a compression nut over a piece of the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.720 
a compression nut over a piece of the
tubing<00:01:50.780> you're<00:01:50.960> using<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.590> inlet<00:01:51.950> push

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
tubing you're using for the inlet push

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.270 
tubing you're using for the inlet push
it<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.030> as<00:01:53.270> far<00:01:53.600> as<00:01:53.660> it<00:01:53.780> will<00:01:53.960> go<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.560> then

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
it in as far as it will go and then

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.530 
it in as far as it will go and then
again<00:01:55.640> screw<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.120> tightly<00:01:56.540> by<00:01:57.020> hand<00:01:58.480> do<00:01:59.480> the

again screw in tightly by hand do the

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.510 
again screw in tightly by hand do the
same<00:01:59.810> thing<00:02:00.050> for<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.350> outlet<00:02:00.770> tubing<00:02:01.220> on<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
same thing for the outlet tubing on the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.290 
same thing for the outlet tubing on the
other<00:02:01.730> side<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.660> compression<00:02:03.340> nut<00:02:04.340> around

other side of the compression nut around
the<00:02:05.420> tubing<00:02:06.820> should<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.970> screw<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:08.960> in<00:02:09.140> tightly

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
the tubing should it screw it in tightly

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.580 
the tubing should it screw it in tightly
now<00:02:11.270> it's<00:02:11.450> ready<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.720> take<00:02:11.840> over<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.560> a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
now it's ready to take over to you a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.920 
now it's ready to take over to you a
little<00:02:12.890> bit<00:02:15.970> stick<00:02:16.970> your<00:02:17.000> chlorinator<00:02:17.660> where

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
little bit stick your chlorinator where

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.420 
little bit stick your chlorinator where
you'll<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.230> installing<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.130> once<00:02:19.280> again

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
you'll be installing it and once again

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.250 
you'll be installing it and once again
check<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.150> make<00:02:20.300> sure<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.630> tubes<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
check to make sure the tubes that you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
check to make sure the tubes that you
cut<00:02:21.470> are<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.709> correct<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.250> line<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.880> you're

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
cut are the correct the line that you're

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.820 
cut are the correct the line that you're
going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.209> need<00:02:23.420> also<00:02:23.990> make<00:02:24.350> sure<00:02:24.590> you're

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
going to need also make sure you're

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.650 
going to need also make sure you're
installing<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.459> in-and-out<00:02:26.030> sides

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
installing the in-and-out sides

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.900 
installing the in-and-out sides
correctly<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.860> would<00:02:28.430> think<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.700> goes

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
correctly I would think this goes

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.220 
correctly I would think this goes
without<00:02:29.150> saying<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:29.570> make<00:02:29.810> sure<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.020> shut

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
without saying but make sure you shut

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.470 
without saying but make sure you shut
off<00:02:30.260> your<00:02:30.350> pump<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.070> also<00:02:31.610> shut<00:02:31.790> my<00:02:31.940> valves<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
off your pump I also shut my valves to

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.180 
off your pump I also shut my valves to
make<00:02:32.510> sure<00:02:32.780> no<00:02:32.990> water<00:02:33.230> was<00:02:33.440> coming<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.920> or

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
make sure no water was coming in or

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.490 
make sure no water was coming in or
going<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.850> pool<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.330> we're<00:02:36.320> going<00:02:36.410> to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
going out of the pool so we're going to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.089 
going out of the pool so we're going to
drill<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.860> 3/8<00:02:37.280> inch<00:02:37.580> inlet<00:02:38.090> hole<00:02:38.330> first

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.369 

I<00:02:45.359> kind<00:02:46.359> of<00:02:46.480> cleaned<00:02:46.749> away<00:02:46.870> some<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
I kind of cleaned away some of the

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.780 
I kind of cleaned away some of the
shavings<00:02:47.829> when<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.040> was<00:02:48.159> most<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.700> way

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
shavings when I was most of the way

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.770 
shavings when I was most of the way
through<00:02:49.090> see<00:02:49.840> some<00:02:50.019> water<00:02:50.260> dripping<00:02:50.590> out<00:02:50.859> now

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.940 

that's<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.740> we're<00:02:57.040> through

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that's it we're through

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.220 
that's it we're through
next<00:02:59.610> you're<00:02:59.730> gonna<00:02:59.790> get<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.270> gasket<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.080> put

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
next you're gonna get the gasket and put

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.559 
next you're gonna get the gasket and put
it<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> saddle<00:03:01.830> fitting<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.270> then<00:03:03.390> put

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
it on the saddle fitting and then put

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.210 
it on the saddle fitting and then put
that<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.989> hole<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.620> drilled

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that in the hole that you just drilled

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.979 
that in the hole that you just drilled
and<00:03:05.459> remember<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:05.910> these<00:03:06.060> parts<00:03:06.450> come<00:03:06.750> with

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
and remember all these parts come with

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
and remember all these parts come with
it<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:08.010> you're<00:03:08.160> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.310> wrap<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.790> clamp

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
it and you're going to wrap the clamp

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.600 
it and you're going to wrap the clamp
around<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.950> tighten<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.430> up

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
around all of it and then tighten it up

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.000 
around all of it and then tighten it up
first<00:03:15.120> by<00:03:15.330> hand<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.230> then<00:03:16.350> finish<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
first by hand and then finish with the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280 
first by hand and then finish with the
screwdriver<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:18.300> want<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> go<00:03:18.569> tight<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.140> not

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
screwdriver you want to go tight but not

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.510 
screwdriver you want to go tight but not
so<00:03:19.530> tight<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:20.069> break<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> pipe<00:03:20.670> obviously

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
so tight you break the pipe obviously

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.590 
so tight you break the pipe obviously
next<00:03:23.520> you're<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.850> do<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> same<00:03:24.239> thing

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
next you're going to do the same thing

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.360 
next you're going to do the same thing
you<00:03:24.780> did<00:03:24.930> before<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.650> compression<00:03:26.040> nut

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you did before with a compression nut

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.300 
you did before with a compression nut
and<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.760> tubing<00:03:27.590> screw<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:28.890> real<00:03:29.099> good

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and the tubing screw that in real good

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.670 
and the tubing screw that in real good
and<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:30.360> that's<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.720> for<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> inline<00:03:31.350> image

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and then that's it for the inline image

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.340 
and then that's it for the inline image
we're<00:03:32.580> gonna<00:03:32.670> do<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> exact<00:03:33.150> same<00:03:33.180> thing<00:03:33.810> for

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
we're gonna do the exact same thing for

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.870 
we're gonna do the exact same thing for
the<00:03:34.440> outlet<00:03:34.739> connection<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.670> there

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the outlet connection we just in there

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.180 
the outlet connection we just in there
measure<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> again<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.290> make<00:03:37.410> sure<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.830> cut

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
measure it again and make sure you cut

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.880 
measure it again and make sure you cut

I'll<00:04:01.430> let<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.610> run<00:04:01.850> for<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.120> minute<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.810> watch

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
I'll let it run for a minute and watch

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.690 
I'll let it run for a minute and watch
all<00:04:03.320> four<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.620> those<00:04:03.770> connections<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.550> make

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
all four of those connections to make

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.670 
all four of those connections to make
sure<00:04:04.850> there<00:04:05.000> aren't<00:04:05.150> any<00:04:05.270> leaks<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:06.170> by<00:04:06.350> four

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
sure there aren't any leaks and by four

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.130 
sure there aren't any leaks and by four
I<00:04:06.710> mean<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.310> two<00:04:07.610> holes<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.900> just

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
I mean the two holes that you just

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.620 
I mean the two holes that you just
drilled<00:04:09.500> as<00:04:10.160> well<00:04:10.430> as<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.730> two<00:04:10.940> spots<00:04:11.270> where

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
drilled as well as the two spots where

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.490 
drilled as well as the two spots where
the<00:04:11.960> tubes<00:04:12.200> are<00:04:12.410> going<00:04:12.680> into<00:04:12.860> your<00:04:13.010> corner

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
the tubes are going into your corner

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.530 
the tubes are going into your corner
after<00:04:15.500> minute<00:04:15.980> or<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:16.250> turn<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.640> pump<00:04:16.850> off<00:04:17.030> and

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
after minute or so turn the pump off and

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.229 
after minute or so turn the pump off and
open<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.049> chlorinator<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.970> I'm<00:04:20.090> not

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
open up the chlorinator now I'm not

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.030 
open up the chlorinator now I'm not
really<00:04:20.480> an<00:04:20.690> expert<00:04:21.140> here<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:21.560> I'm<00:04:21.799> pretty

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
really an expert here but I'm pretty

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.500 
really an expert here but I'm pretty
sure<00:04:22.250> if<00:04:22.370> there's<00:04:22.580> water<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:23.090> there<00:04:23.300> it's

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
sure if there's water in there it's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.240 
sure if there's water in there it's
working<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.050> way<00:04:24.140> it's<00:04:24.350> supposed<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.800> be<00:04:24.980> so

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
working the way it's supposed to be so

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.610 
working the way it's supposed to be so
we're<00:04:25.430> looking<00:04:25.700> good<00:04:25.810> at<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:27.050> point<00:04:27.140> go

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
we're looking good at this point go

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.650 
we're looking good at this point go
ahead<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:27.920> add<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.190> your<00:04:28.310> three-inch<00:04:28.760> slow

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
ahead and add in your three-inch slow

ahead and add in your three-inch slow

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
dissolving try Clorox I think it said

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.580 
dissolving try Clorox I think it said
you<00:04:32.150> can<00:04:32.270> add<00:04:32.390> up<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.690> nine<00:04:32.900> pounds<00:04:33.350> at<00:04:33.440> any

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
you can add up to nine pounds at any

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
time I'm not exactly sure about that but

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.480 
time I'm not exactly sure about that but
put<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> top<00:04:37.550> back<00:04:37.580> on<00:04:38.620> set<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.710> flow<00:04:39.980> rate<00:04:40.250> on

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
put the top back on set the flow rate on

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.280 
put the top back on set the flow rate on
my<00:04:40.640> control<00:04:41.030> valve<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.630> whatever<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:42.080> want

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
and turn the pump back on and that is it
