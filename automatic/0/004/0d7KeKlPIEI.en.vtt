before<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.000> EOC<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.720> use<00:00:24.900> steel

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
before the EOC I would just use steel

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
before the EOC I would just use steel
telling<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.590> kill<00:00:25.769> those<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.220> after<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> EOC

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
telling to kill those and after the EOC

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.700 
telling to kill those and after the EOC
it<00:00:27.210> doesn't<00:00:27.480> look<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.050> too<00:00:28.560> much

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it doesn't look like they do too much

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
it doesn't look like they do too much
damage<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:29.730> even<00:00:29.820> worth<00:00:30.060> using

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
damage like it's not even worth using

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
damage like it's not even worth using
them<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.050> them<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
them on them so you got to go with the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.040 
them on them so you got to go with the
dragon<00:00:33.000> pickaxe<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> ended

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
dragon pickaxe and that's what I ended

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.130 
dragon pickaxe and that's what I ended
up<00:00:34.380> doing<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.430> literally<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:36.059> taking<00:00:36.630> 20

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
up doing and it literally was taking 20

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
up doing and it literally was taking 20
to<00:00:37.260> 30<00:00:37.559> hits<00:00:37.950> each<00:00:38.280> time<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.570> their<00:00:39.719> armor

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to 30 hits each time to get their armor

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.600 
to 30 hits each time to get their armor
down<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.160> wave<00:00:41.370> where

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
down and I got to that wave where

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
down and I got to that wave where
there's<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.969> 10<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> them<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.780> what

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

food
oh<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.829> shelled<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> fire<00:00:47.760> cape<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.180> Here

I<00:00:48.390> am<00:00:48.510> now<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:49.140> Bandos<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.370> would<00:00:51.000> say<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
I am now at Bandos I would say it was a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
I am now at Bandos I would say it was a
successful<00:00:52.050> trip<00:00:52.230> although<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> didn't

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
successful trip although I didn't

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.090 
successful trip although I didn't
exactly<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.690> any<00:00:54.989> good<00:00:55.230> drops<00:00:55.680> yet

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
exactly get any good drops yet

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.279 
exactly get any good drops yet

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
unfortunately there's definitely a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.900 
unfortunately there's definitely a
different<00:00:58.649> strategy<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.250> killing<00:00:59.520> bandits

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
different strategy to killing bandits

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
different strategy to killing bandits
now<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.480> even<00:01:00.660> pray<00:01:00.930> melee<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
now you don't even pray melee what you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
now you don't even pray melee what you
do<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.160> camp<00:01:02.430> soul<00:01:02.730> split<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> get

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
do is you camp soul split and you get

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I think it's safe to say if this looks

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.910 
I think it's safe to say if this looks
interesting<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:28.049> note<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.680> don't

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
interesting just note that you don't

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
interesting just note that you don't
need<00:01:29.159> torva<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> ban<00:01:30.420> DOS<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.659> solo<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
need torva to go to ban DOS and solo you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.100 
need torva to go to ban DOS and solo you
can<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.950> full<00:01:32.189> void<00:01:32.840> basically<00:01:33.840> no

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
can go with full void basically no

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
can go with full void basically no

sure<00:02:43.380> give<00:02:43.740> me<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.860> shot<00:02:44.130> over<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.580> I've

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
sure give me a shot over there I've

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.060 
sure give me a shot over there I've
decided<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.870> probably<00:02:46.560> would<00:02:46.740> be<00:02:46.890> best

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
decided that it probably would be best

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.520 
decided that it probably would be best
to<00:02:47.280> separate<00:02:47.730> those<00:02:48.210> type<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.690> videos<00:02:49.200> like

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
to separate those type of videos like

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.220 
to separate those type of videos like
Minecraft<00:02:50.220> black<00:02:50.850> ops<00:02:51.209> Halo<00:02:51.750> whatever<00:02:52.050> other

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
Minecraft black ops Halo whatever other

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.720 
Minecraft black ops Halo whatever other
games<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.709> feel<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.040> playing<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.490> throwing

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.760 
games I feel like playing and throwing
up<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.150> channel<00:02:54.480> separate<00:02:55.470> from

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
up on that channel separate from

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.590 
up on that channel separate from
runescape<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.490> think<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.940> would<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.209> safe

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
runescape I think that would be a safe

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.630 
runescape I think that would be a safe
thing<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:58.470> why<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.550> guys

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
thing to do because why do you guys

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.010
