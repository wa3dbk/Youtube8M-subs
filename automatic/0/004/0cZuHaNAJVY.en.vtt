dist and I'm gonna connect and I hit
this<00:00:21.600> Bluetooth<00:00:22.310> button<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.050> they're

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
this Bluetooth button this is they're

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.109 
this Bluetooth button this is they're
actually<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.619> same<00:00:25.920> procedure<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> d8

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
actually the same procedure for the d8

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
actually the same procedure for the d8
I'll<00:00:27.960> show<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.619> another<00:00:28.680> video<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.460> right

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I'll show that in another video so right

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.900 
I'll show that in another video so right

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
now the Bluetooth icon is blinking that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.459 
now the Bluetooth icon is blinking that
means<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.300> actively<00:00:33.780> looking<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.200> our

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
means it's actively looking for our

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.240 
means it's actively looking for our
Bluetooth<00:00:34.680> device<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> connect<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
Bluetooth device to connect to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.470 
Bluetooth device to connect to
you've<00:00:38.250> already<00:00:38.430> connected<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> phone

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you've already connected to the phone

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.280 
you've already connected to the phone
it'll<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.410> find<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> phone<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
it'll actually just find the phone and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.810 
it'll actually just find the phone and
connect<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> automatically<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.489> because

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
connect to it automatically but because

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
connect to it automatically but because
it's<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> first<00:00:45.270> time<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.050> doesn't<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it's the first time it doesn't do it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
it's the first time it doesn't do it
this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.390> right<00:00:49.260> now

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
this is what we have to do so right now

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
this is what we have to do so right now
in<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.829> phone<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.850> actually<00:00:51.000> pull<00:00:51.480> down

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
in my phone I'm gonna actually pull down

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590 
in my phone I'm gonna actually pull down
this<00:00:51.989> top<00:00:52.500> menu<00:00:53.129> bar<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.239> will<00:00:54.329> give<00:00:54.449> me

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this top menu bar and it will give me

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.380 
this top menu bar and it will give me
access<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.170> Bluetooth<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> phone

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
access to my Bluetooth of the phone

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
access to my Bluetooth of the phone
currently<00:00:57.390> I've<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> off<00:00:58.039> occasionally<00:00:59.690> turn

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

there I'm gonna actually I'm not seeing
the<00:01:17.970> disco<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.170> phone<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the disco on the phone so I'm going to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.230 
the disco on the phone so I'm going to
search<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.369> devices<00:01:21.979> that's<00:01:22.979> doing<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> search

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.990 

here's<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> disco<00:01:28.229> de<00:01:28.560> 3<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
here's the disco de 3 and that's the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
here's the disco de 3 and that's the
330i<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> serial

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
330i and that's actually the serial

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.679 
330i and that's actually the serial
number<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.909> multiple<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
number so if you have multiple so you

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.899 
number so if you have multiple so you
can<00:01:33.840> connect<00:01:34.320> multiple<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:35.189> pulls<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
can connect multiple I pulls with a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.380 
can connect multiple I pulls with a
serial<00:01:36.540> number<00:01:36.780> recognition<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.270> I'm

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
serial number recognition so here I'm

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.569 
serial number recognition so here I'm
going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> type<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.820> zero<00:01:41.820> zero<00:01:42.180> zero<00:01:42.509> zero

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
going to type in zero zero zero zero

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.660 
going to type in zero zero zero zero
four<00:01:44.579> zeros<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.780> default<00:01:46.310> done<00:01:47.310> for

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
four zeros that's the default done for

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.240 
four zeros that's the default done for
any<00:01:48.030> disco<00:01:48.560> when<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.680> pairing<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> that's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
any disco when you're pairing it that's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
any disco when you're pairing it that's
actually<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:51.149> default<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> lot<00:01:51.960> of
