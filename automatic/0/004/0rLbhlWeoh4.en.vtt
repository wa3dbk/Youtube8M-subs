00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
was because we believe that the pleasure

was because we believe that the pleasure
trap<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.130> hidden<00:01:14.280> forces<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> way

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
trap is the hidden forces in the way

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
trap is the hidden forces in the way
itself<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> having<00:01:15.780> us<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.590> fact<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
itself and having us the fact is the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
itself and having us the fact is the
artificial<00:01:17.729> stimulation<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.509> dopamine<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
artificial stimulation of dopamine in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.179 
artificial stimulation of dopamine in
our<00:01:19.439> brain<00:01:19.770> knows<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.250> pleasure<00:01:22.189> based

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
our brain knows that pleasure based

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.530 
our brain knows that pleasure based
hormone<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:27.530> really<00:01:28.530> deceptive<00:01:28.920> trap

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
hormone is a really deceptive trap

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.969 
hormone is a really deceptive trap
because<00:01:30.540> we're<00:01:30.810> designed<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.590> seek<00:01:31.799> pleasure

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
because we're designed to seek pleasure

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.960 
because we're designed to seek pleasure
and<00:01:33.799> we're<00:01:34.799> designed<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.400> an<00:01:35.490> environment

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and we're designed for an environment

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.060 
and we're designed for an environment
where<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.390> highly<00:01:36.780> processed<00:01:37.229> foods<00:01:37.650> don't

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
where these highly processed foods don't

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.899 
where these highly processed foods don't
exist

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
exist

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.850 
exist
so<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> world<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.930> ancient<00:01:40.079> ancestors

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so in the world of ancient ancestors

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.679 
so in the world of ancient ancestors
there<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.159> no<00:01:41.340> temptation<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> eating

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
there was no temptation to be eating

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.569

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
choose from and that's how we're

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289

these<00:02:00.740> very<00:02:01.100> concentrated<00:02:01.670> foods<00:02:02.330> our<00:02:03.080> brains

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
these very concentrated foods our brains

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.530 
these very concentrated foods our brains
stimulate<00:02:04.159> more<00:02:04.460> dopamine<00:02:04.700> secretion<00:02:05.330> were

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
stimulate more dopamine secretion were

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.510 
stimulate more dopamine secretion were
designed<00:02:06.409> for<00:02:06.619> an<00:02:06.710> environment<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.159> scarcity

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
designed for an environment of scarcity

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940 
designed for an environment of scarcity
where<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.450> biological<00:02:09.170> imperative<00:02:09.649> was<00:02:09.800> to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
where the biological imperative was to

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890 
where the biological imperative was to
get<00:02:10.160> enough<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.550> eat<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.940> avoid<00:02:11.569> being<00:02:11.750> eaten

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
get enough to eat and avoid being eaten

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.430 
get enough to eat and avoid being eaten
and<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.040> our<00:02:13.340> brain<00:02:13.580> rewards<00:02:14.240> us<00:02:14.390> any<00:02:14.660> time<00:02:15.200> we

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
and so our brain rewards us any time we

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.949 
and so our brain rewards us any time we
find<00:02:15.739> clerkly<00:02:16.220> dense<00:02:16.489> foods<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.750> higher

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
find clerkly dense foods so the higher

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.630 
find clerkly dense foods so the higher
the<00:02:17.989> Clerc<00:02:18.319> density<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.430> dopamine

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
the Clerc density the more dopamine

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.010 
the Clerc density the more dopamine
secreted<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.390> more<00:02:20.540> pleasure<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.400

doesn't<00:02:26.060> work<00:02:26.300> as<00:02:26.450> well<00:02:26.480> today<00:02:26.810> because<00:02:27.260> in

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
doesn't work as well today because in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.559 
doesn't work as well today because in
the<00:02:27.530> today<00:02:27.830> with<00:02:28.100> oil<00:02:28.400> salts<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.030> sugars<00:02:29.090> and

the today with oil salts and sugars and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.650 
the today with oil salts and sugars and
highly<00:02:29.870> processed<00:02:30.080> foods<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:31.420> problem<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.510> we

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
highly processed foods the problem is we

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.229 
highly processed foods the problem is we
eat<00:02:32.930> those<00:02:33.140> chemicals<00:02:33.709> we<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.940> way<00:02:35.090> it

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
eat those chemicals we like the way it

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.030 
eat those chemicals we like the way it
makes<00:02:35.420> us<00:02:35.630> feel<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.050> we<00:02:36.170> tend<00:02:36.350> anymore<00:02:36.769> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
makes us feel and we tend anymore the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.310 
makes us feel and we tend anymore the
negative<00:02:37.550> effect<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.150> develop<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
negative effect is we develop the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.229 
negative effect is we develop the

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
disease of dietary excess so we become

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.390 
disease of dietary excess so we become
fat<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:42.230> develop<00:02:42.590> high<00:02:42.709> blood<00:02:42.920> pressure<00:02:43.160> or

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
fat we develop high blood pressure or

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.800 
fat we develop high blood pressure or
cardiovascular<00:02:44.000> disease<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.510> develop

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
cardiovascular disease we develop

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
fatty acids from Whole Foods when we get

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.170 
fatty acids from Whole Foods when we get
sugar<00:03:51.320> from<00:03:51.590> Whole<00:03:51.799> Foods<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:52.340> we<00:03:52.430> get<00:03:52.670> the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
sugar from Whole Foods and we get the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.610 
sugar from Whole Foods and we get the
sodium<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.720> other<00:03:53.810> minerals<00:03:54.140> we<00:03:54.290> need<00:03:54.440> from

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
sodium and other minerals we need from

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.770 
sodium and other minerals we need from
Whole<00:03:54.829> Foods<00:03:54.859> but<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.880> turns<00:03:56.180> out<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.570> make<00:03:56.750> a

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
Whole Foods but it turns out to make a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.530 
Whole Foods but it turns out to make a
profound<00:03:57.470> difference<00:03:57.799> if<00:03:58.760> your<00:03:59.060> diet<00:03:59.299> is

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
profound difference if your diet is

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.599 
profound difference if your diet is
coming<00:03:59.900> from<00:04:00.019> whole<00:04:00.320> natural<00:04:00.560> foods<00:04:00.859> the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
coming from whole natural foods the

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:02.610 
coming from whole natural foods the
satiety<00:04:02.030> Meccan<00:04:02.480> is

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
satiety Meccan is

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.130 
satiety Meccan is
in<00:04:02.890> your<00:04:03.010> brain<00:04:03.280> your<00:04:04.030> ability<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.510> processes

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
in your brain your ability to processes

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.780 
in your brain your ability to processes
is<00:04:05.440> very<00:04:05.739> different<00:04:06.220> than<00:04:06.310> if<00:04:06.459> you're<00:04:06.580> eating

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
is very different than if you're eating

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.539 
is very different than if you're eating
a<00:04:06.940> bunch<00:04:07.120> of<00:04:07.209> highly<00:04:07.510> processed<00:04:07.690> chemicals

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
a bunch of highly processed chemicals

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.280 
a bunch of highly processed chemicals
the<00:04:09.549> problem<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.150> not<00:04:10.480> everybody<00:04:10.930> wants<00:04:11.170> to

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
the problem is not everybody wants to

more rapidly a lot of people to free
themselves<00:05:05.110> from<00:05:05.380> those<00:05:05.620> addictions<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:07.270> it

they may not be as powerful a drug like
effective<00:05:09.880> cocaine<00:05:10.300> or<00:05:10.510> methamphetamine<00:05:11.349> but

there's<00:05:12.729> they're<00:05:13.030> working<00:05:13.419> on<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.630> same

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
there's they're working on the same

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.870 
there's they're working on the same
neural<00:05:14.169> cascade<00:05:14.770> they're<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.190> same<00:05:15.430> kind<00:05:15.760> of

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
neural cascade they're the same kind of

neural cascade they're the same kind of
neurological<00:05:16.479> mechanisms<00:05:16.979> at<00:05:17.979> play<00:05:18.010> with

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
these highly processed chemicals and so

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.290 
these highly processed chemicals and so
yeah<00:05:20.650> I<00:05:20.710> would<00:05:21.010> treat<00:05:21.220> them<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:22.030> we<00:05:22.150> do

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
yeah I would treat them and and we do

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.360 
yeah I would treat them and and we do
find<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.750> managing<00:05:23.440> patients<00:05:23.950> that<00:05:24.130> want<00:05:24.280> to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
find that managing patients that want to

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.300 
find that managing patients that want to
get<00:05:24.490> free<00:05:24.729> of<00:05:24.880> these<00:05:25.060> chemicals<00:05:25.860> is<00:05:26.860> very<00:05:27.160> much

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
get free of these chemicals is very much

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.279 
get free of these chemicals is very much
like<00:05:27.490> treating<00:05:27.789> addicts<00:05:27.940> of<00:05:28.210> any<00:05:28.360> kind<00:05:28.570> so<00:05:29.169> the

plant-based<00:05:37.930> foods<00:05:38.380> but<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.860> can't<00:05:39.520> do<00:05:39.669> it

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
plant-based foods but just can't do it

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.070 
plant-based foods but just can't do it
because<00:05:39.880> it<00:05:40.120> doesn't<00:05:40.300> taste<00:05:40.630> good<00:05:40.840> unless

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
because it doesn't taste good unless

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.110 
because it doesn't taste good unless
they<00:05:41.229> add<00:05:41.440> sugar<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:42.010> it<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.310> mean<00:05:42.340> well<00:05:42.940> then

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
they add sugar to it I mean well then

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.250 
they add sugar to it I mean well then
what<00:05:43.240> are<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.419> answers<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.840> first<00:05:43.990> thing<00:05:44.199> is

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
what are the answers the first thing is

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.930 
what are the answers the first thing is
they<00:05:44.380> have<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.530> get<00:05:44.740> educated<00:05:45.250> definitely<00:05:45.699> yes

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
they have to get educated definitely yes

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.029 
they have to get educated definitely yes
at<00:05:46.120> first<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.690> may<00:05:46.840> be<00:05:46.870> tasteless<00:05:47.500> well<00:05:47.860> to

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
at first it may be tasteless well to

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.740 
at first it may be tasteless well to
them<00:05:48.190> but<00:05:48.400> their<00:05:48.550> tastes<00:05:48.910> their<00:05:49.030> nura

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
them but their tastes their nura

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.540 
them but their tastes their nura
adaptive<00:05:50.229> mechanism<00:05:50.800> will<00:05:50.919> in<00:05:51.099> time<00:05:51.310> take

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
talking about we know it was salt it can

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.010 
talking about we know it was salt it can
take<00:05:56.740> up<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:56.949> 30<00:05:57.220> days<00:05:57.490> we<00:05:58.180> know<00:05:58.330> with<00:05:58.510> fats<00:05:58.780> it

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
can take up to three months if people

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.399 
can take up to three months if people
are<00:06:01.180> not<00:06:01.360> patient<00:06:01.900> enough<00:06:01.960> for<00:06:02.289> the

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
are not patient enough for the

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:03.869 
are not patient enough for the
don't<00:06:02.559> have<00:06:02.679> the<00:06:02.800> discipline<00:06:03.249> to<00:06:03.399> wait<00:06:03.610> for

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
don't have the discipline to wait for

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.149 
don't have the discipline to wait for
the<00:06:03.969> body<00:06:04.179> to<00:06:04.389> adapt<00:06:04.719> one<00:06:05.499> option<00:06:05.889> would<00:06:05.979> be<00:06:06.039> to

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
the body to adapt one option would be to

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.679 
the body to adapt one option would be to
undergo<00:06:06.699> a<00:06:06.729> period<00:06:07.089> of<00:06:07.119> medically<00:06:07.509> supervised

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
undergo a period of medically supervised

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.479 
undergo a period of medically supervised
water-only<00:06:08.319> fasting<00:06:08.919> because<00:06:09.129> then<00:06:09.339> the

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:09.489 
water-only fasting because then the

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:12.239 
water-only fasting because then the
process<00:06:10.149> happens<00:06:10.509> much<00:06:10.689> more<00:06:10.899> quickly<00:06:11.139> so<00:06:11.860> if

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:12.249 
process happens much more quickly so if

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:14.429 
process happens much more quickly so if
you're<00:06:12.459> a<00:06:12.489> patient<00:06:12.969> and<00:06:13.179> persistent<00:06:13.439> people

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 
you're a patient and persistent people

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.439 
you're a patient and persistent people
do<00:06:14.619> adapt<00:06:14.949> to<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.159> health-promoting<00:06:15.610> diet<00:06:15.939> if

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
do adapt to the health-promoting diet if

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.600 
do adapt to the health-promoting diet if
you<00:06:16.779> need<00:06:16.989> a<00:06:17.019> little<00:06:17.229> help<00:06:17.349> then<00:06:18.069> you<00:06:18.489> know

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
you need a little help then you know

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.669 
you need a little help then you know
it's<00:06:18.849> very<00:06:19.059> much<00:06:19.330> like<00:06:19.360> treating<00:06:20.169> alcoholics

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:20.679 
it's very much like treating alcoholics

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.079 
it's very much like treating alcoholics
if<00:06:20.860> you<00:06:20.949> tell<00:06:21.129> them<00:06:21.189> that<00:06:21.339> clock<00:06:21.519> oh<00:06:21.699> it's<00:06:21.969> the

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
if you tell them that clock oh it's the

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.259 
if you tell them that clock oh it's the
alcohol<00:06:22.649> stop<00:06:23.649> drinking<00:06:24.129> sometimes<00:06:24.879> they<00:06:25.059> can

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:25.269 
alcohol stop drinking sometimes they can

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:27.059 
alcohol stop drinking sometimes they can
but<00:06:25.929> other<00:06:26.110> times<00:06:26.409> people<00:06:26.769> need<00:06:26.919> a<00:06:26.949> little

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
but other times people need a little

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.309 
but other times people need a little
help<00:06:27.399> to<00:06:27.550> make<00:06:27.669> that<00:06:27.819> transition<00:06:28.389> but

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
help to make that transition but

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.899 
help to make that transition but
ultimately<00:06:29.830> it<00:06:30.069> comes<00:06:30.249> down<00:06:30.369> to<00:06:30.519> the<00:06:30.759> same

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
ultimately it comes down to the same

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:32.609 
ultimately it comes down to the same
thing<00:06:30.969> health<00:06:31.569> results<00:06:32.080> from<00:06:32.229> healthful

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:32.619 
thing health results from healthful

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.499 
thing health results from healthful
living<00:06:32.739> we've<00:06:33.159> got<00:06:33.339> to<00:06:33.459> get<00:06:33.580> people<00:06:33.729> living

living we've got to get people living

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.899 
living we've got to get people living
healthily<00:06:34.809> and<00:06:35.050> adding<00:06:35.769> chemicals<00:06:36.429> to<00:06:36.789> the

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
healthily and adding chemicals to the

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.909 
healthily and adding chemicals to the
food<00:06:37.179> like<00:06:37.419> sugar<00:06:37.719> and<00:06:38.050> all<00:06:38.139> those<00:06:38.259> insults<00:06:38.589> is

food like sugar and all those insults is

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.589 
food like sugar and all those insults is
not<00:06:39.219> what<00:06:39.579> I<00:06:39.610> would<00:06:39.819> define<00:06:40.119> as<00:06:40.239> healthful

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
not what I would define as healthful

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.629 
not what I would define as healthful
living<00:06:40.719> it<00:06:41.050> I<00:06:41.289> mean<00:06:41.739> I<00:06:41.829> definitely<00:06:41.919> agree<00:06:42.429> or

living it I mean I definitely agree or
that<00:06:42.849> I<00:06:43.149> think<00:06:43.629> one<00:06:43.869> of<00:06:43.959> the<00:06:44.019> cool<00:06:44.409> things
