what is up internet this is Steve's and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.670 
what is up internet this is Steve's and
today<00:00:05.250> i<00:00:05.279> am<00:00:05.520> bringing<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:07.140> little

today i am bringing you a little

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.290 
today i am bringing you a little
breakdown<00:00:08.010> how<00:00:08.849> fast<00:00:09.210> can<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.570> pump<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.080> baby

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
breakdown how fast can you pump it baby

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.490 
breakdown how fast can you pump it baby
today<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.660> know<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:12.990> something<00:00:13.320> i<00:00:13.469> just

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
today you know this is something i just

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.310 
today you know this is something i just
always<00:00:13.920> wanted<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> test<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> modern

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
always wanted to test in in the modern

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.779 
always wanted to test in in the modern
warfare<00:00:16.440> 3<00:00:17.449> game<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.130> because<00:00:20.130> i<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.760> use

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
warfare 3 game and because i like to use

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.450 
warfare 3 game and because i like to use
the<00:00:21.270> pump<00:00:21.660> action<00:00:21.869> shotguns<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.830> know

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the pump action shotguns I know

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
the pump action shotguns I know
technically<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.359> model<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> break<00:00:25.109> action

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
technically the model is a break action

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529 
technically the model is a break action
but<00:00:25.740> we're<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:27.330> takes

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
but we're not going to go there it takes

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
but we're not going to go there it takes
one<00:00:28.199> step<00:00:28.529> before<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.400> shoot<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> gun

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
one step before you can shoot the gun

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.110 
one step before you can shoot the gun
again<00:00:30.500> anyways<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:32.340> you'll<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.000> I'm

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
again anyways as you'll see here I'm

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
again anyways as you'll see here I'm
kind<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.630> doing<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.260> free<00:00:35.040> handedly

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
kind of just doing this free handedly

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.549 
kind of just doing this free handedly
there's<00:00:35.760> not<00:00:35.969> really<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> real<00:00:36.870> scientific

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
there's not really a real scientific

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
there's not really a real scientific
experiment<00:00:38.309> before<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.700> behind<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.329> wish

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
experiment before it behind it I wish

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
experiment before it behind it I wish
that<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.050> could<00:00:40.200> break<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> game<00:00:40.890> data<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that I could break into the game data I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.010 
that I could break into the game data I
do<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.879> where<00:00:42.000> people<00:00:42.270> find<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
do not know where people find that and I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.569 
do not know where people find that and I
could<00:00:43.230> figure<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.070> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> just

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
could figure this out but I kind of just

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
could figure this out but I kind of just
did<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.850> myself<00:00:45.180> because<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.660> interested

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
did it myself because I was interested

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.610 
did it myself because I was interested
and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:47.309> broke<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.030> down<00:00:48.180> frame<00:00:48.719> by<00:00:48.930> frame<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and I broke it down frame by frame in

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
and I broke it down frame by frame in
Vegas<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> timed<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.719> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
Vegas and that is how I timed it so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
Vegas and that is how I timed it so
there<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> margin<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.160> error<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
there is a margin of error on the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
there is a margin of error on the
results<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:55.050> frame<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.649> 30<00:00:56.280> frames<00:00:56.430> per

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
results of one frame at 30 frames per

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.220 
results of one frame at 30 frames per
second<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.239> margin<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.719> error<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.930> 0<00:00:57.989> point<00:00:58.199> 0

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
second that margin of error is 0 point 0

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.439 
second that margin of error is 0 point 0
3<00:00:58.800> seconds<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.460> those<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> out<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.059> who

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
3 seconds for those of you out there who

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.860 
3 seconds for those of you out there who
are<00:01:00.480> true<00:01:00.930> scientists<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.629> pretty

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
are true scientists and you know pretty

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.750 
are true scientists and you know pretty
much<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> results<00:01:04.739> coming<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.369> are<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
much the results coming up here are that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
much the results coming up here are that
the<00:01:06.119> KSG<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> space<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.650> par<00:01:07.950> with

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the KSG and the space are on par with

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
the KSG and the space are on par with
each<00:01:08.220> other<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.580> far<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:08.909> cycle<00:01:09.270> time<00:01:09.479> normal

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
each other as far as cycle time normal

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
each other as far as cycle time normal
cycle<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.460> fourth<00:01:11.760> cycle<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.270> when

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
cycle and then the fourth cycle is when

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
cycle and then the fourth cycle is when
you're<00:01:12.570> shooting<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.960> gun<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you're shooting a gun and then you you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
you're shooting a gun and then you you
span<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> trigger<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> shoot<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> as

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
span the trigger kind of shoot it as

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
span the trigger kind of shoot it as
fast<00:01:15.780> again<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:16.799> faster<00:01:16.979> than

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
fast again it's a little bit faster than

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550 
fast again it's a little bit faster than
its<00:01:17.460> normal<00:01:17.610> cycle<00:01:18.090> time<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> those

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
its normal cycle time but all of those

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
its normal cycle time but all of those
are<00:01:19.619> within<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.189> margin<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.670> error<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
are within the margin of error of the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.870 
are within the margin of error of the
frames<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> hard<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
frames and so it's kind of hard and you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
frames and so it's kind of hard and you
think<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> model<00:01:24.720> would<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.200> longer

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
think the model would be a little longer

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.330 
think the model would be a little longer
and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.710> always<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.189> impression<00:01:26.460> too<00:01:26.909> but

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and I always got that impression too but

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
and I always got that impression too but
there<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.119> model<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> obviously<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
there it is the model is obviously the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
there it is the model is obviously the
slowest<00:01:31.320> gun<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.650> between<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> KSG<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
slowest gun so between the KSG in this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.649 
slowest gun so between the KSG in this
past<00:01:33.030> 12<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:35.659> technically

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
past 12 which one do you use technically

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.929 
past 12 which one do you use technically
the<00:01:36.810> game<00:01:37.049> says<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> KSG<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> slight

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the game says that the KSG has a slight

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.240 
the game says that the KSG has a slight
bit<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> damage<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:40.020> far<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.710> speed<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
bit of damage as far as speed is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.840 
bit of damage as far as speed is
concerned<00:01:41.670> though<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:43.280> feel<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> case

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
concerned though I feel like the case

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
concerned though I feel like the case
she's<00:01:45.180> faster<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:45.869> people<00:01:46.259> commented

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
she's faster and then people commented

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.240 
she's faster and then people commented
that<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.979> wasn't<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.810> really<00:01:49.140> hard<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.070> say

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that it wasn't it's really hard to say

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.700 
that it wasn't it's really hard to say
because<00:01:50.540> even<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.780> they're<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.170> close<00:01:52.500> as

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
because even here they're so close as

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
because even here they're so close as
you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> rankings<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.659> it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
really up to you technically the case G

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.970 
really up to you technically the case G
has<00:02:21.220> more<00:02:21.550> damage<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.590> little<00:02:23.830> bit

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
has more damage and it's a little bit

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.540

faster by my rankings and between

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.580 
faster by my rankings and between
accuracy<00:02:28.060> which<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.780> only<00:02:28.930> other<00:02:29.200> staff

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
accuracy which is the only other staff

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.100 
accuracy which is the only other staff
that<00:02:29.770> they<00:02:29.860> differ<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.489> KSG<00:02:30.850> beats<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that they differ on the KSG beats the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.260 
that they differ on the KSG beats the
spare<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.650> lose<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.340> out<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.700> pass<00:02:33.940> there

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
spare is lose it out to this pass there

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.449 
spare is lose it out to this pass there
but<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.470> find<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.830> they're<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.040> two

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
but I really find that they're just two

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.340 
but I really find that they're just two
different<00:02:36.489> guns<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.450> they<00:02:37.900> actually<00:02:38.080> have

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
different guns and they actually have

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.630 
different guns and they actually have
very<00:02:38.530> similar<00:02:38.769> qualities<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.560> know<00:02:41.680> it's

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
very similar qualities so you know it's

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
very similar qualities so you know it's
really<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:44.110> in<00:02:44.380> order<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:44.709> to
