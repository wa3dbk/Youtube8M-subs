lot<00:06:03.780> more<00:06:04.190> user<00:06:05.190> friendly<00:06:05.310> so<00:06:05.849> you<00:06:05.940> guys<00:06:06.120> could

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.760 
opposed to me picking them so I think
they'll<00:06:09.449> be<00:06:09.599> kind<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:09.780> cool<00:06:09.930> also<00:06:10.380> I<00:06:10.409> was<00:06:10.590> going
