00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For a number of years, the US and Europe have been implementing regulations 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.639
to promote quality food and encourage local production. 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.820
Those measures are partly accountable for the food security 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.549
in our countries.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.240
However, at the moment, the US and the European commission 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.489
are preparing an agreement aiming at abolishing all those protections.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.000
This transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) is also called 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.640
TAFTA, Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement.  

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.289
American and European industrial groups will be able to flood 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.780
consumers with products from which we don't know the origin nor the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.059
social conditions of production, and possibly dangerous for health.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.000
Your health.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.700
The aim is clearly to promote agribusiness without caring about the consequences.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.580
We make the deliberate choice to suppress thousands of jobs, particularly among

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.900
farmers, to empty the countryside to fill the cities. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.469
And also to damage soil quality,

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.170
to threaten capacity of nations to feed their own population.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.860
And in order to do so, we need appropriate tools.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.699
Like many free-trade agreements, TAFTA will require a commercial tribunal

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.480
which sets multinational companies and States on equal footing.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.630
This kind of tribunal enabled the tobacconist Philip Morris to sue

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.820
Australia, because the State had decided to make an anti-tobacco

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.250
campaign.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.770
If TAFTA is accepted,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.270
we won't be able to object to GMOs.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480
It is Democracy under threat that we are talking about.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.130
A mayor won't be able to provide his city's canteen with local products anymore

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.680
because of so-called "distortion of competition".

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.180
We won't be able to choose proximity and local agricultures,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.690
those which enable to protect water resources or biodiversity,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.520
those which stimulate employment and secure the quality of food.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.110
Your food.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680
Citizens have previously managed to block similar agreements.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.560
We can do it too.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.250
So let's do it, let's take action.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.990
Take action, now.
