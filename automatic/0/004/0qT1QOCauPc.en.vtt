00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it was nowhere near as open as it is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130 
it was nowhere near as open as it is
right<00:01:56.370> now<00:01:56.400> but<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.480> this<00:01:57.660> warm

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
right now but because of this warm

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840 
right now but because of this warm
weather<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.860> warm<00:01:59.190> front<00:01:59.370> that's<00:01:59.520> come

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
weather this warm front that's come

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.840 
weather this warm front that's come
through<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.210> 54<00:02:00.900> degrees<00:02:01.290> today<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.980> knew<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
through at 54 degrees today I knew it I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
through at 54 degrees today I knew it I
knew<00:02:02.970> if<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.270> kept<00:02:03.510> chipping<00:02:03.750> away<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
knew if I kept chipping away and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.460 
knew if I kept chipping away and
removing<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.760> would<00:02:05.850> make<00:02:06.030> enough

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
removing it that it would make enough

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.620 
removing it that it would make enough
weak<00:02:07.470> areas<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.369> would<00:02:08.520> pop<00:02:08.760> open<00:02:09.000> without

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
weak areas that would pop open without

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.420 
weak areas that would pop open without
physically<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.440> into<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> pond<00:02:11.130> because

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
physically going into the pond because

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.100 
physically going into the pond because
sometimes<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.240> not<00:02:12.450> something<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.840> want<00:02:13.020> to

do<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.410> winter<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.740> don't<00:02:13.920> want<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.220> in

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
do in the winter you don't want to go in

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.520 
do in the winter you don't want to go in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.590 
to have the opening you have to have
that<00:02:37.770> opening<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> gases<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:39.000> come<00:02:39.450> out

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
that opening for the gases to come out

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.950 
that opening for the gases to come out
so<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.320> koi<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:41.550> live<00:02:41.790> through<00:02:42.780> this

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
so that the koi will live through this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840 
so that the koi will live through this
winter<00:02:43.200> season<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:44.100> would<00:02:44.280> not<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.460> come

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
winter season if we would not have come

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.150 
winter season if we would not have come
here<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.300> opened<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.020> these<00:02:46.230> holes<00:02:46.530> these<00:02:46.770> koi

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
here and opened up these holes these koi

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280 
here and opened up these holes these koi
would<00:02:47.370> not<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:48.000> alive<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.050> matter

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
would not be alive so it's not a matter

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.590 
would not be alive so it's not a matter
of<00:02:49.410> CEO<00:02:49.950> they<00:02:50.220> were<00:02:50.280> okay<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> matter<00:02:51.540> of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
of CEO they were okay it was a matter of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
home open you've got to have the gases

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.870 
home open you've got to have the gases
released<00:02:57.620> as<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:59.040> see<00:02:59.250> they<00:02:59.550> are<00:02:59.580> down

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
there actually I haven't found the heat

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.570 
there actually I haven't found the heat
at<00:03:03.630> SRI<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.440> thing

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
at SRI that I know that thing

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.010 
at SRI that I know that thing
that's<00:03:06.580> not<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.970> one<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.270> I'm<00:03:07.420> looking<00:03:07.570> for

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
that's not the one that I'm looking for

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.070 
that's not the one that I'm looking for
but<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.150> good<00:03:10.330> sign<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.870> good<00:03:10.900> sign

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
but it's a good sign it's a good sign

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.810 
but it's a good sign it's a good sign
that<00:03:11.260> there's<00:03:11.560> movement<00:03:11.830> they<00:03:12.370> heard<00:03:12.670> my
