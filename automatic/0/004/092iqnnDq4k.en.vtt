00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
thinking like if you could take any rule

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.970 
thinking like if you could take any rule
from<00:02:22.770> another<00:02:23.040> sport<00:02:23.959> or<00:02:24.959> any<00:02:25.080> component<00:02:25.650> here

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
from another sport or any component here

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.790 
we go on the far side here it's blasco
going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> chance<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.530> move<00:02:28.650> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
