tying crusty bread though

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890 
tying crusty bread though
that's<00:02:13.890> probably<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.400> five<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:14.610> six<00:02:14.910> still

that's probably like five or six still
got<00:02:16.020> six<00:02:16.230> ingredients<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> piece<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> meat

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
got six ingredients but a piece of meat

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.990 
got six ingredients but a piece of meat
steak<00:02:19.200> was<00:02:19.800> how<00:02:20.100> many<00:02:20.160> ingredients<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.790> got

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
steak was how many ingredients that got

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.330 
steak was how many ingredients that got
its<00:02:21.600> got<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:22.200> ingredient<00:02:22.380> right<00:02:22.830> now<00:02:23.100> yeah

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
its got one ingredient right now yeah

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.490 
its got one ingredient right now yeah
you<00:02:23.400> could<00:02:23.610> throw<00:02:23.730> spices<00:02:24.210> on<00:02:24.360> there<00:02:24.540> um<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
you could throw spices on there um I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.640 
you could throw spices on there um I
don't<00:02:26.220> count<00:02:26.520> those<00:02:26.730> those<00:02:26.940> ingredients<00:02:27.650> my

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
don't count those those ingredients my

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.610 
don't count those those ingredients my
point<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.100> want<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.490> eat<00:02:29.700> Whole<00:02:30.090> Foods

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
point is you want to eat Whole Foods

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.980 
point is you want to eat Whole Foods
okay<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:32.370> want<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.910> most<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.600> your<00:02:33.630> diet

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
okay you want to have most of your diet

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.650 
okay you want to have most of your diet
consists<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.740> Whole<00:02:35.040> Foods<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.640> course<00:02:35.880> every

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
consists of Whole Foods of course every

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.970 
consists of Whole Foods of course every
once<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> while<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.500> fits<00:02:37.710> your<00:02:37.860> macros

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
once in a while if it fits your macros

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.590 
once in a while if it fits your macros
you're<00:02:38.430> going<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> want<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.090> get<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> pop

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you're going to want to go on get a pop

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.300 
you're going to want to go on get a pop
tart<00:02:39.900> or<00:02:40.110> something<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.100> that's

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
tart or something like that and that's

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.660 
tart or something like that and that's
fine<00:02:41.720> but<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.530> can't<00:02:43.740> live<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.130> pop<00:02:44.310> tarts

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
fine but you can't live on pop tarts

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.390 
fine but you can't live on pop tarts
alone<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.210> I'd<00:02:46.020> say<00:02:46.320> about<00:02:46.530> ninety<00:02:46.980> percent<00:02:47.130> of

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
alone so I'd say about ninety percent of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.440 
alone so I'd say about ninety percent of
your<00:02:47.550> food<00:02:47.870> should<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:48.900> whole<00:02:49.890> food<00:02:50.480> too<00:02:51.770> and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
your food should be whole food too and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.210 
your food should be whole food too and
those<00:02:54.450> who<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.530> will<00:02:57.890> go<00:02:58.890> at

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
those who do not do this will go at

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.420 
those who do not do this will go at
their<00:02:59.490> own<00:02:59.520> peril<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.440> are<00:03:01.740> going<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
their own peril if you are going to do a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.550 
their own peril if you are going to do a
flexible<00:03:02.970> dieting<00:03:04.250> program<00:03:05.250> then<00:03:06.350> all<00:03:07.350> that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
flexible dieting program then all that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.750 
flexible dieting program then all that
stuff<00:03:07.830> they're<00:03:07.980> saying<00:03:08.100> about<00:03:08.220> nutrient

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
stuff they're saying about nutrient

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.960 
stuff they're saying about nutrient
timing<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.300> mattering<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:10.020> bullshit<00:03:10.590> I

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
timing not mattering is bullshit I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.940 
timing not mattering is bullshit I
really<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.510> really<00:03:12.620> hope<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.800> guys

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
really really really hope you guys

really really really hope you guys
understand<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.520> people<00:03:14.730> are<00:03:15.000> trying<00:03:15.150> to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
understand that people are trying to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.759 
understand that people are trying to
sell<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.780> something<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.320> seems<00:03:16.620> easy<00:03:17.540> and

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
sell you something that seems easy and

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.660 
sell you something that seems easy and
this<00:03:19.769> doesn't<00:03:20.010> make<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.459> much<00:03:20.489> more

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
this doesn't make it that much more

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.280 
this doesn't make it that much more
complicated<00:03:21.320> but<00:03:22.320> one<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> factors<00:03:24.000> of

more<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.000> more<00:03:27.150> research<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.110> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
more and more research now is that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.560 
more and more research now is that
insulin<00:03:29.040> sensitivity<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.060> insulin

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
insulin sensitivity and insulin

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.300 
insulin sensitivity and insulin
resistance<00:03:31.140> are<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> huge<00:03:31.680> factor<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.280> whether

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
resistance are a huge factor on whether

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.259 
resistance are a huge factor on whether
or<00:03:32.489> not<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.790> become<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> fatass<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.970> we<00:03:35.970> need<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
or not you become a fatass so we need to

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.460 
or not you become a fatass so we need to
make<00:03:36.420> sure<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.600> you're<00:03:36.810> eating<00:03:37.200> your

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
make sure that you're eating your

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.050 
make sure that you're eating your
carbohydrates<00:03:38.130> at<00:03:38.280> times<00:03:38.489> when<00:03:38.700> your<00:03:38.880> most

insolent sensitive and for most of you

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.300 
insolent sensitive and for most of you
that<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.049> going<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> be<00:03:43.500> right<00:03:43.920> after<00:03:44.190> your
