 half hour of the match lens that evolves on 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.040
 most of its holders the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.890
 central hinge yahia kantari is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.200
 not there the lord chavarria and el geneina

 where they are also injured but that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 does not prevent lens from returning to the score 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.490
 it's been twice in this part 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.570

 the crocos Nîmes still leads to score 3 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.860

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.450
 the ounce remains on two victories without 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.760

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.820
 the merit of coming back three times 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.770
 they will not succeed in marking the 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.310
