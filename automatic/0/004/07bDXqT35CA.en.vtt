00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 dear friends hello and welcome our 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 chronic photo that today very 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 very top 10 most questions 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.050
 frequently asked the question 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.570
 number 1 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.270
 often asked how we come to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.220
 winter is there a danger in using a 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.689
 camera outside at the big 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 cold 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.040
 in fact what you need to know 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 it is rather the pile 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.370
 the accumulator that suffer when 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.710
 uses a camera a cold 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.570
 there is no real danger uses a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.330
 camera cold can be 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 use it even in the temperatures 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.730
 considerably basic like for example 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.920
 - but at least take 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 however, always keep a battery 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.970
 an accumulator on oneself warm and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.680
 opportunity to replace them because 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.560
 Once the city is warm she 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.470
 resume his energy as a question 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.320
 number 2 what is the worst enemy of 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.100
 the camera did everything devices 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 confused 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.159
 There is only one enemy even 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 many 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.070
 the two main obviously the water the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.479
 contact with water a killer alou me 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.550
 obviously if you are in a place 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 where near the beach or at the sea 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.510
 squarely try to avoid at all 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.900
 price of seawater on the device 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.909
 Photo 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.470
 even if we follow them corrosion 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.900
 pick up on all the pieces that are 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.150
 metal the other obviously you'll have it 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.479
 guessed is to associate as often with the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.510
 beach 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.430
 the boom particular precautions before 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.350
 even when we are going to ask for dust 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.729
 of sand so what happens is that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.650
 it infiltrates little bit everywhere in 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.560
 the camera is winding the same in the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.360
 gears system versus goals 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.159
 to this question precisely because 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.040
 raises a problem in giving you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.900
 a solution for the type of devices 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.369
 reflex there are so-called 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.470
 waterproof bags in wars one can 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.689
 put the cameras and we can get 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.820
 walk for example support or on a 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.049
 boat a sailboat no matter 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.640
 the water at that moment you come across 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 this species of that which is transparent 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.590
 and protect your interest in a fairly 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.840
 effective one can also him 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 when you are in a place that is very 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.860
 dusty where there is a lot of sand 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.319
 for compact devices like this 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.239
 here there are watertight boxes 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.069
 can buy with the device one can 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.780
 even go under water with his 15 are 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.310
 waterproof what we can not do 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.500
 the event with the bags which one 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.629
 spoke previously 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.670
 question number 3 is what I can 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.959
 use a polarizing filter like 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.019
 protective filter to protect 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.129
 the front element of my lens but 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.890
 Obviously we always try and 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.810
 save so saved lille shot must 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.269
 know that a polarizing filter can 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.769
 serve outside protection 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.750
 since it obviously protects the element 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.690
 frontal but as soon as we get to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.340
 inside the godfather's son 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.900
 absolutely about will stay half to 12 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.569
 tons of light so only left clean 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.670
 and the prices as much light will not act 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.260
 correct way often the inside at 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.420
 world in the yum we do not want to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.940
 remove through the lens 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.280
 the other thing when taking a picture 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.670
 flash with a polarizing filter often 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.920
 the result and form noted the question 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.440
 number 4 concerns memory cards 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.420
 is it important to format 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.310
 his memory card 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.780
 in fact the answer is very simple yes 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.650
 we must form such a memory card 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.569
 regularly 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.670
 it's a bit like doing the housework 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.170
 complete memory card 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.849
 when we are facing he only pictures 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.639
 what we do is a bit like passing 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.599
 the broom in a room when one forms 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.130
 to the memory card 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.599
 indeed this really all the traces 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.880
 so it's like really clean at 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.980
 background it's pretty simple in most 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.889
 menus one is simply going in 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.709
 the menu format the card requested on 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.160
 formatting pressed rust and turn 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.769
 is played 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.069
 obviously you have to transfer your photos 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.690
 before formatted naggar the question number 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.359
 5 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.500
 the penalties are properly charged yet 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.900
 with my camera when I 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.819
 taken 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.110
 under this picture the device puts 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.620
 immediately they and they are 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.439
 exhausted 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.629
 what's going on actually it takes 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.579
 know that rechargeable batteries 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.829
 the epeat will double for example have a 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.870
 lifetime of about two years so 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.439
 it is normal that after two years he fails 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.200
 replace 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:16.079
 with regard to type batteries 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.539
 lithium so epilogue stack like that 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.169
 ci the life time but varied between 2 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.550
 and 6 and 27 in some cases so the 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.860
 much longer life span for 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.930
 the bikes said there is the question 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.300
 number 6 we are often asked 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.020
 difference between an optical zoom and a 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.970
 digital zoom launched very simple all 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.580
 compact cameras of this type 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.289
 so often have a digital zoom 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.169
 the digital zoom is actually 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.020
 the optical zoom electronic extension 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.010
 ie when I handle the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.900
 zoned 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.360
 the goal stretches to a certain 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.729
 point past this point 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.130
 it's an electronic man who grows 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.039
 the image so it's a magnification 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.250
 artificial is not designed by the zoom 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.139
 optical or the elements another optics 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.330
 patriots to day a better quality 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.780
 image that the digital zoom even though 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.760
 sometimes it's really up to them 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.360
 so part 1 of our picture 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.340
 chronic 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.000
 please follow us shortly for the 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.000
 second part
