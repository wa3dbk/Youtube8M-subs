00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
Tremaine fresh out of the shower and

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.879 
Tremaine fresh out of the shower and
here<00:00:14.389> to<00:00:14.750> talk<00:00:15.050> to<00:00:15.170> you<00:00:15.259> about<00:00:15.320> our<00:00:15.440> winter

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
here to talk to you about our winter

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.880 
here to talk to you about our winter
garden<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:17.599> built<00:00:17.750> some<00:00:18.020> cold<00:00:18.259> frames<00:00:18.560> out

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
garden so we built some cold frames out

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.570 
garden so we built some cold frames out
of<00:00:19.279> recycled<00:00:20.270> pallets<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.320> they<00:00:22.250> turned<00:00:22.490> out

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
of recycled pallets and they turned out

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.099 
of recycled pallets and they turned out
pretty<00:00:22.699> well<00:00:22.850> I<00:00:23.270> think<00:00:23.570> they<00:00:23.660> probably<00:00:23.840> need

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
pretty well I think they probably need

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.769 
pretty well I think they probably need
to<00:00:24.140> be<00:00:24.410> resealed<00:00:25.070> on<00:00:25.550> each<00:00:25.850> year<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.449> we<00:00:26.600> use

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
to be resealed on each year and we use

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.070 
to be resealed on each year and we use
grease<00:00:27.080> recycled<00:00:27.740> we<00:00:27.859> such<00:00:28.130> loyal<00:00:28.519> for<00:00:28.850> that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
grease recycled we such loyal for that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.300 
grease recycled we such loyal for that
but<00:00:30.080> I<00:00:30.349> really<00:00:30.590> want<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.769> talk<00:00:30.890> about<00:00:30.949> what

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
but I really want to talk about what

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.070 
but I really want to talk about what
we're<00:00:31.460> growing<00:00:31.699> so<00:00:32.330> we<00:00:32.480> didn't<00:00:32.660> know<00:00:32.750> what<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
we're growing so we didn't know what the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.780 
we're growing so we didn't know what the
hell<00:00:33.230> we<00:00:33.320> can<00:00:33.440> grow<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:33.949> winter<00:00:34.070> how's<00:00:34.760> it

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
concern with cold frames which is what

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.150 
concern with cold frames which is what
these<00:01:04.729> are<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.300> that<00:01:05.899> plants<00:01:06.410> we<00:01:06.530> reach<00:01:07.009> a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
these are is that plants we reach a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.530 
these are is that plants we reach a
certain<00:01:07.310> height<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.939> then<00:01:08.119> they<00:01:08.299> hit<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
certain height and then they hit the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.000 
certain height and then they hit the
glass<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.110> I'm<00:01:09.200> not<00:01:09.320> really<00:01:09.470> sure<00:01:09.560> what<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:09.890> do

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
glass and I'm not really sure what to do

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.770 
glass and I'm not really sure what to do

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
over here my personal winter fave is

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.330 
over here my personal winter fave is
broccoli<00:01:31.460> rabe<00:01:32.290> these<00:01:33.290> guys<00:01:33.470> just<00:01:33.770> started

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
broccoli rabe these guys just started

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.149 
broccoli rabe these guys just started
but<00:01:35.060> last<00:01:35.270> year<00:01:35.659> our<00:01:36.259> broccoli<00:01:36.500> rabe<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:37.070> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
but last year our broccoli rabe in the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.560 
but last year our broccoli rabe in the
middle<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.490> winter<00:01:37.640> was<00:01:37.909> about<00:01:38.119> four<00:01:38.360> feet

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
middle of the winter was about four feet

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.600 
middle of the winter was about four feet
tall<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:39.680> think<00:01:39.740> these<00:01:40.040> guys<00:01:40.220> are<00:01:40.280> going<00:01:40.549> to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
tall so I think these guys are going to

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.210 
tall so I think these guys are going to
come<00:01:40.759> up<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.710> potentially<00:01:42.710> give<00:01:42.860> us<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.040> lot<00:01:43.159> of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
come up and potentially give us a lot of

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.219 
come up and potentially give us a lot of
food<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:46.490> like<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.119> spit<00:01:47.390> bad<00:01:47.810> because<00:01:48.079> it's

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
food and I like to spit bad because it's

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.929 
food and I like to spit bad because it's
new<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.450> don't<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.509> organized

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
new and it's I don't know organized

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.560 
new and it's I don't know organized
heavy<00:01:52.939> as<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.270> can<00:01:53.479> see<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> lot<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.340> volunteers

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
heavy as you can see a lot of volunteers

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.670 
heavy as you can see a lot of volunteers
it'll<00:01:56.570> be<00:01:56.659> interesting<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.110> see<00:01:57.229> how<00:01:57.409> this

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
it'll be interesting to see how this
