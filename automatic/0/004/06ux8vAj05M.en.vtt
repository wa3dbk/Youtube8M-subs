like<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.140> i<00:03:16.350> thought<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.740> was<00:03:16.800> really

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
like that i thought that was really

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.160 
like that i thought that was really
unique<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:17.850> those<00:03:18.240> all<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.540> hard<00:03:18.870> covers

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
unique because those all the hard covers

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.430 
unique because those all the hard covers
are<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.580> solid<00:03:20.970> color<00:03:21.210> so<00:03:21.720> i<00:03:22.290> thought

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
are like just a solid color so i thought

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.590 
are like just a solid color so i thought
that<00:03:22.590> was<00:03:22.650> pretty<00:03:22.860> next<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> sequel<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
that was pretty next is a sequel to a

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.380 
that was pretty next is a sequel to a
book<00:03:24.990> i<00:03:25.140> really<00:03:25.380> like<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.100> vanish<00:03:26.670> by
