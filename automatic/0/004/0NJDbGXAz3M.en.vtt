00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.190
 we find the park of eden from a 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.110
 closing day however we want already 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.090
 take a look at the future and the future 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.730
 of hedlund is the theme park that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 opened in spring 2013 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.450
 we have here the director of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.360
 francesco russello park that there 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.080
 will illustrate some of the attractions of the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.420
 park 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.010
 we are in front of the dark ride 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.570
 interactive attraction we wanted 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.610
 instead of providing it with guns and targets 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 we wanted to make this dark ride 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.670
 interactive and bring back our customers 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.650
 at the school then an exam with questions 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.049
 different answers to which you can 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.110
 answer directly from the cars e 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:58.860
 who will pass the exams will be 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.559
 then promoted the ghosts of the janitors 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.559
 some professors will accompany ours 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.110
 visitors during the visit the target 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.720
 of this tradition turns to everything 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.540
 the public there are limitations yes 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 addresses absolutely all the public 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.640
 great little old people are called to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.920
 another time at school classroom for classroom 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 will have to overcome the difficulties that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.359
 obviously going back to school involves 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.520
 regarding the length of the 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:30.240
 time-consuming path we should 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 be around three minutes of dark ride 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 and therefore a rather suitable time 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 in short, for our standards of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 attraction and therefore when we can 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 finally crossing the gates of this one 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.679
 dark ride at the gates should be 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 open to the public for the end of March 2013 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.499
 this is at least the objective that there is 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.049
 we are prefixed 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.149
 we will look clearly in the works that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.249
 continue in the construction site to be 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.670
 punctual to arrive at the inauguration 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:01.200
 in time we are facing another 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.509
 of the new tractions he will present 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.039
 etnaland in 2013 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.130
 we ask the manager francesco 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.229
 russello to tell us the story of 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.330
 this attraction is its theming 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.380
 and the feelings the public will feel 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.510
 it's always a cost 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.770
 rather fast 600 meters of route 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.840
 24 of height and typical drawing from mine 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.930
 train therefore the theming will follow 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.460
 the project of the coaster a mine that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.670
 is inspired by the Sicilian mines and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.640
 however Mediterranean where ours 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.070
 train will bring visitors 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.650
 to the experience of a journey in the mine 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.690
 which takes place first on the train and then at 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.370
 walk to the exit 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.280
 so we have a car anyway 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.440
 dedicated to the family with children from 1 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.810
 meter and 20 up with a path that 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 should get to the minute and something 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.000
 this attraction is inserted 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.280
 at the beginning and right of the entrance to the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 main street of the park along with the out 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.040
 school in area that plays a little 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.070
 what was the beginning of the twentieth century 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.100
 these mining areas with the village e 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.810
 mine work place and therefore also 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.970
 staff accommodation 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.590
 this the thematization will be realized 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.780
 shortly it will start shortly since 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.820
 we have already finished the assembly and within the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.140
 coming month will begin to see each other already 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.810
 the first part of domination 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.540
 completes a crescendo of attractions 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.070
 from the simplest to the most extreme 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.240
 we give more and the appointment 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.810
 spring to try this new one 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.550
 attraction and being able to be involved in 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.690
 this our new experience that the 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.690
 park will want to give visitors
