you<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> basically<00:00:19.590> your<00:00:19.770> app

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you can see this is basically your app

you can see this is basically your app
drawer<00:00:20.250> unfortunately<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.240> seems<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.660> not

drawer unfortunately it seems to be not
so<00:00:22.140> compatible<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.920> least<00:00:23.039> my<00:00:23.340> display

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
so compatible with at least my display

so compatible with at least my display
the<00:00:23.820> galaxy<00:00:24.180> s3<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.689> perhaps<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.500> via<00:00:25.650> dpi

that<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.910> ROM<00:00:27.180> set<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.570> which<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.080> 320

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that I have this ROM set at which is 320

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070 
that I have this ROM set at which is 320
so<00:00:29.640> hopefully<00:00:29.939> they'll<00:00:30.150> fix<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.840> maybe

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so hopefully they'll fix that in maybe

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.659 
so hopefully they'll fix that in maybe
the<00:00:31.199> coming<00:00:31.529> updates<00:00:31.800> which<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.189> seem<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> be

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the coming updates which do seem to be

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
the coming updates which do seem to be
frequent<00:00:33.480> enough<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:34.469> least<00:00:34.559> anyways<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
frequent enough at least anyways and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.350 
frequent enough at least anyways and
then<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> course<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.239> these

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
then of course we have all these

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
then of course we have all these
different<00:00:36.600> tiles<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.469> predefined

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
tiles we have some empty one so that you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780

add<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> would<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.330> nice<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:27.990> some

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
add that it would be nice to see some

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
add that it would be nice to see some
live<00:01:28.380> tiles<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:30.360> know

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
live tiles going on there I don't know

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
live tiles going on there I don't know
how<00:01:30.659> he<00:01:30.720> would<00:01:30.900> implement<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> would

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
how he would implement it but it would

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
how he would implement it but it would
be<00:01:32.490> nice<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:33.060> especially<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.619> know

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
be nice to see especially if you know

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.760 
be nice to see especially if you know
he's<00:01:34.829> trying<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> emulate<00:01:35.400> Windows<00:01:35.790> 8<00:01:36.770> click

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
he's trying to emulate Windows 8 click

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.960 
he's trying to emulate Windows 8 click
on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> background<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.820> can

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
on the background there and we can

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
on the background there and we can
actually<00:01:39.439> choose<00:01:40.439> different<00:01:40.770> backgrounds<00:01:41.250> as

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
actually choose different backgrounds as

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.560 
actually choose different backgrounds as
you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.360> currently

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you can see so right now we currently

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.969 
you can see so right now we currently
have<00:01:42.869> green<00:01:43.200> let's<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.470> ahead<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.680> select<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
have green let's go ahead and select a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.710 
have green let's go ahead and select a
lime<00:01:44.189> green<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.360> we're<00:01:45.479> looking

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
lime green and that's what we're looking

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.109 
lime green and that's what we're looking
at<00:01:45.810> there<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.070> even<00:01:47.310> select<00:01:47.460> black<00:01:47.850> if

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
at there you can even select black if

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
at there you can even select black if
you<00:01:48.210> wanted<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.110> looks<00:01:49.740> pretty

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you wanted to and that looks pretty

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
you wanted to and that looks pretty
sharp<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:51.119> far<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.420> speed<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.020> concerned<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
sharp as far as speed is concerned this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
sharp as far as speed is concerned this
isn't<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> fastest<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.610> least<00:01:53.790> consistently

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
isn't the fastest at least consistently

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
isn't the fastest at least consistently
right<00:01:55.350> now<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:56.189> running<00:01:56.369> pretty

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
right now it's actually running pretty

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
right now it's actually running pretty
quick<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.450> because<00:01:57.570> my

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
quick but I think that's because my

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.590 
quick but I think that's because my
processor<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.009> revved<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.399> enough<00:01:59.820> where<00:02:00.390> it's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
processor is revved up enough where it's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.209 
processor is revved up enough where it's
actually<00:02:00.780> able<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> handle<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> frame<00:02:01.979> rates

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
actually able to handle the frame rates

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.160 
actually able to handle the frame rates
however<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.420> bit<00:02:03.600> earlier<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.049> was

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
however a little bit earlier when I was

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.480 
however a little bit earlier when I was
testing<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> seemed<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.399> bit

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
testing it out it seemed a little bit

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.950 
testing it out it seemed a little bit
stuttering<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.060> little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.390> disappointing

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
stuttering a little bit disappointing

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
stuttering a little bit disappointing
especially<00:02:07.350> considering<00:02:07.799> how<00:02:08.000> absolutely

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

we<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.610> many<00:02:15.060> options<00:02:15.660> there

we really don't have many options there
the<00:02:16.170> last<00:02:16.350> option<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> actually<00:02:17.040> do

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the last option that you actually do

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040 
the last option that you actually do
have<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.670> manage<00:02:18.060> tiles<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.780> remove

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
have is manage tiles and you can remove

have is manage tiles and you can remove
specific<00:02:19.650> tiles<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.460> not<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> them<00:02:20.970> which

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
specific tiles but not all of them which

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.050 
specific tiles but not all of them which
I<00:02:21.210> found<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:22.620> kind<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.130> irritating<00:02:23.850> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I found really kind of irritating and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.640 
I found really kind of irritating and
strange<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:24.870> understand<00:02:25.320> why<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> can

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
strange I don't understand why you can

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.620 
strange I don't understand why you can
just<00:02:25.800> remove<00:02:26.040> certain<00:02:26.640> tiles<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.360> others

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
just remove certain tiles and not others

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
just remove certain tiles and not others
maybe<00:02:28.350> there's<00:02:28.560> some<00:02:28.710> other<00:02:28.800> logic<00:02:29.070> that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
maybe there's some other logic that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.970 
maybe there's some other logic that
seems<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:29.880> escaping<00:02:30.270> me<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.770> what

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
seems to be escaping me but it is what

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.980 
seems to be escaping me but it is what
it<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.190> hopefully<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.240> mean<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
it is hopefully I mean and this is a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.680 
it is hopefully I mean and this is a
pretty<00:02:34.290> fresh<00:02:34.560> launcher<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.280> I'm<00:02:35.940> guessing

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
pretty fresh launcher so I'm guessing

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.900 
pretty fresh launcher so I'm guessing
that<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.110> updates<00:02:37.530> come<00:02:37.770> down<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.340> we'll

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
that with as updates come down and we'll

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.430 
that with as updates come down and we'll
probably<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.330> some<00:02:39.510> improvements<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
probably see some improvements there and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560 
probably see some improvements there and
of<00:02:41.310> course<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.730> hitting<00:02:42.060> settings<00:02:42.420> will

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
of course just hitting settings will

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.810 
of course just hitting settings will
just<00:02:42.720> jump<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.050> into<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.620> devices<00:02:44.370> settings

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
just jump you into your devices settings

just jump you into your devices settings
anyways<00:02:45.540> guys<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:46.440> application<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
anyways guys this application is a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.710 
anyways guys this application is a
dollar<00:02:47.430> 95<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.090> Play<00:02:48.240> Store<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.570> got<00:02:48.690> a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
dollar 95 on the Play Store it's got a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.210 
dollar 95 on the Play Store it's got a
rating<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.140> about<00:02:49.200> three<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.710> half<00:02:49.740> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
rating of about three and a half so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.710 
rating of about three and a half so
obviously<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:50.790> not<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.970> best<00:02:51.300> out<00:02:51.510> there

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
obviously it's not the best out there

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.550 
obviously it's not the best out there
but<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.020> kind<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.290> interesting

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
but it's kind of an interesting

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.290 
but it's kind of an interesting
experience<00:02:53.190> definitely<00:02:53.760> something<00:02:54.240> worth

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
experience definitely something worth

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.270 
experience definitely something worth
trying<00:02:54.630> out<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.050> are<00:02:55.170> interested<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.770> you
