00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.160
 Good, but let's find a way on this link. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.590
 it's hideous 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 to start cotton and acetone toothpick 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 Let's get this base on and on. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.449
 also use a list of cuticles and I will 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.910
 leave for five minutes in my 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.430
 nails today did not appear in the video people 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 just decap dinho and ready I passed him 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.029
 after five minutes I shot with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 cotton dampened with water or acetone 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.790
 even and with the help of a spatula I 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.820
 I'll push the cuticle back to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.710
 get easier to take that way 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.280
 so it's very simple and I enjoy shooting 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 this regime of cuticle that is 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.590
 Nailed too and I'm going up 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.789
 I was going to leave a little beauty 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.789
 great this stator tip 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.739
 and after you take it all you just have to use one 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.159
 pliers to remove all that remained there 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.680
 then lost the application 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.270
 the cuticle 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.220
 who would rather not take the cuticle just from 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.920
 helps us a lot of people but who 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.320
 fail to take I shot 15 fifteen 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.270
 20 days days depends on rest 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:28.119
 I'm just pushing with the sea 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:30.909
 even with the spatula and now that the sandpaper 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.429
 Basic fingernail I'm liking framed 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.590
 more with the half contained or will know 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.470
 so I lit up on the sides and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.720
 Chinese volleyball question does not stay so one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.690
 hatch had this way 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.979
 Good, I use a cream to avoid. 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.600
 dry hands 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.429
 This is what I broke because they feel more 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.140
 people at the time I went to record the video 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.450
 I hope it's good to use a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.750
 little and passed on hands like this 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 condoms and look great right now 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.940
 note and color base base nourishes base 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.579
 that is already great and site clovinho lonely people 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.070
 put inside ajita and after some 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.440
 minutes ready to use we stay 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.350
 great strengthens the nail grows is a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.260
 beauty I only use is so I only use this 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.859
 so note this basic tip and just 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.890
 passed on the nails now and let's go 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.980
 for the enamels or but imagine I go 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.230
 use that dannatt which is the strong wind 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.480
 He is a beautiful face that I am in. 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.010
 love is the first time i use but no 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.440
 I've been in love since 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.859
 I bought 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.810
 I pass the first layer without normal and 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.489
 not clean i clean only after completing 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.829
 the five lines but first I'm going 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.829
 leaving and going this way 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.150
 here in the river everybody takes the tip 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.680
 I do not like it very much then 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.960
 had a first layer for the second 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.790
 layer does not need to take and does not seem 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.190
 that has speckle I saw it like this without 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.290
 and passes the second layer of the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.750
 same way the first being that this 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 time, it does not take a 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:18.540
 five lines and good olimpo and for 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.160
 clean with cotton and acetone. 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.080
 new anyone who prefers can use remover 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.450
 of enamel I prefer acetone worse than 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.000
 It went out fast and I'm usually 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.990
 and it is only however all the nails until 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.990
 the end all the top five 10 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.670
 and cleaning until the end and last 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.860
 pass a layer of drying oil to 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.720
 they look bright and quick and 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.890
 is there the end result hopefully many 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.740

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.560
