yeah<00:00:00.210> a<00:00:00.240> little<00:00:00.719> bit<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:01.230> thought<00:00:01.709> our<00:00:01.860> third

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
yeah a little bit I thought our third

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.439 
yeah a little bit I thought our third
was<00:00:02.370> better<00:00:02.550> in<00:00:02.700> her<00:00:02.760> second<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.210> thought<00:00:03.330> her

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
was better in her second I thought her

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.889 
was better in her second I thought her
second<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.929> wasn't<00:00:04.290> quite<00:00:04.890> as<00:00:05.100> good<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.779> took<00:00:06.779> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
second I wasn't quite as good but took a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.129 
second I wasn't quite as good but took a
few<00:00:07.020> penalties<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:08.840> certainly<00:00:09.840> didn't<00:00:10.019> get

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
few penalties and certainly didn't get

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.499 
few penalties and certainly didn't get
the<00:00:10.230> outcome<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.590> wanted<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.429> second<00:00:11.820> gave<00:00:12.389> him

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the outcome we wanted so second gave him

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
the outcome we wanted so second gave him
a<00:00:12.540> role<00:00:12.719> obviously<00:00:13.139> you've<00:00:13.320> had<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.799> few

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a role obviously you've had a few

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.680 
a role obviously you've had a few
penalties<00:00:15.109> they<00:00:16.109> did<00:00:16.289> surprise<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.690> I'm

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
penalties they did surprise you that I'm

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.279 
penalties they did surprise you that I'm
sure<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.109> was<00:00:19.260> preached<00:00:19.560> after<00:00:19.949> Lasky<00:00:23.720> yeah<00:00:24.720> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
sure it was preached after Lasky yeah I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.140 
sure it was preached after Lasky yeah I
don't<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.650> gotta<00:00:26.340> look<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> calls<00:00:26.939> i

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
don't know you gotta look at the calls i

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
don't know you gotta look at the calls i
didn't<00:00:27.390> i<00:00:27.510> didn't<00:00:27.840> take<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> look<00:00:28.260> at<00:00:28.410> him<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.710> i

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
didn't i didn't take a look at him so i

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
didn't i didn't take a look at him so i
don't<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:29.010> how<00:00:29.099> bad<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.490> were<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.470> think

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
don't know how bad they were but I think

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.900 
don't know how bad they were but I think
overall<00:00:31.710> our<00:00:31.859> team's<00:00:32.189> pretty<00:00:32.430> disciplined<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
overall our team's pretty disciplined I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
overall our team's pretty disciplined I
don't<00:00:33.090> think<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.360> would<00:00:33.809> take<00:00:33.989> many<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.469> are

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
don't think we would take many that are

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.110 
don't think we would take many that are
you<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.370> away<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> player

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you know away from the player

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
you know away from the player
retaliatory<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.050> think<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
retaliatory I think you know that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.470 
retaliatory I think you know that
they're<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> action<00:00:38.790> sometimes<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> take

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
they're in the action sometimes you take

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.869 
they're in the action sometimes you take
them<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.710> didn't<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.340> anything<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.760> was

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
her power play you know a few places we

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.510 
her power play you know a few places we
didn't<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.530> know<00:01:46.619> whatever<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> trips

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
didn't but you know whatever the trips

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
didn't but you know whatever the trips
over<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.409> learn

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
over and then you know we got to learn

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.740 
over and then you know we got to learn
from<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.299> can't<00:01:51.540> have

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
from that because you you can't have

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
from that because you you can't have
that<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.560> late<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> series<00:01:53.189> or

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that you know late in the series or

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.620 
that you know late in the series or
something<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> find<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
something like that we have to find a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
something like that we have to find a
way<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:55.020> better<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.470> hopefully<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.009> learn

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
way to be better so hopefully we learn

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.709 
way to be better so hopefully we learn
from<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.210> better<00:01:57.360> next<00:01:57.570> time

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
from that so we can be better next time

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.650 
from that so we can be better next time
that<00:01:57.930> happens

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.510
