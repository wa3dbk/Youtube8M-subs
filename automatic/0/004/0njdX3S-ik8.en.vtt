not<00:00:45.809> only<00:00:46.170> does<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.800> change<00:00:47.520> him<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> dog

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
not only does it change him out a dog

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
not only does it change him out a dog
bone<00:00:48.480> angle<00:00:50.270> which<00:00:51.270> which<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:51.840> gives<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bone angle which which really gives you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.520 
bone angle which which really gives you
the<00:00:52.379> amount<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> lockup<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.430> forward<00:00:53.940> bite

the amount of lockup and forward bite

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
the amount of lockup and forward bite
but<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:55.800> changes<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.940> quick<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
but it also changes how how quick the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
but it also changes how how quick the
vehicle<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.500> transfer<00:00:58.980> weight<00:00:59.160> when

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
vehicle will will transfer weight when

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.340 
vehicle will will transfer weight when
the<00:01:00.239> hubs<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:00.840> back<00:01:01.050> it'll

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the hubs are all the way back it'll

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
the hubs are all the way back it'll
transfer<00:01:01.859> weight<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.309> slower<00:01:02.670> it'll<00:01:03.120> be

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
transfer weight a lot slower it'll be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.590 
transfer weight a lot slower it'll be
smoother<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> car<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.909> more<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.330> power

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
smoother the car will have more on power

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420 
smoother the car will have more on power
steering<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.650> less<00:01:07.860> dog<00:01:08.159> bone

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
steering because you have less dog bone

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.149 
steering because you have less dog bone

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
run the hubs back that gives the car a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.929 
run the hubs back that gives the car a
lot<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.070> corner<00:01:17.369> speed

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
lot of corner speed

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.660

it's<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.210> fluid<00:01:21.689> through<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.930> bumps<00:01:22.380> but

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's really fluid through the bumps but

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's really fluid through the bumps but
if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.540> bit<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:24.869> forward

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
if you need a little bit more forward

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.840 
if you need a little bit more forward
bite<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:25.950> remove<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> rear<00:01:27.210> hinge<00:01:27.450> pin

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
bite you just remove the rear hinge pin

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.219 
bite you just remove the rear hinge pin
take<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.180> spacers<00:01:30.780> put<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.110> behind

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
take one or two spacers put it behind

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.440 
take one or two spacers put it behind
the<00:01:31.530> hub<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.460> you'll<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:32.909> really<00:01:33.299> be

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the hub and and you'll really really be

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
the hub and and you'll really really be
amazed<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.070> difference<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
amazed at how much of a difference you

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.330 
amazed at how much of a difference you
have<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.880> forward<00:01:36.329> bite<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> another<00:01:38.130> thing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
have in forward bite and another thing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
have in forward bite and another thing
that<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> dog<00:01:38.700> bone<00:01:38.939> lockup<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.659> by

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that the dog bone lockup will do by

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
that the dog bone lockup will do by
making<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> wheelbase<00:01:40.650> shorter<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
making the wheelbase shorter is it it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
making the wheelbase shorter is it it
really<00:01:42.450> supports<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.110> rear<00:01:43.380> end<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> makes<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
really supports the rear end it makes it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.460 
really supports the rear end it makes it
stiffer<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.360> won't<00:01:45.540> bottom<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> faces

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
stiffer it won't bottom out in the faces

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
stiffer it won't bottom out in the faces
of<00:01:46.680> jumps<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.640> holes<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.729> something

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
of jumps or holes so so it's something

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.600 
of jumps or holes so so it's something
that's<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.210> very<00:01:51.509> powerful<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.710> something

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that's very very powerful and something

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.530 
that's very very powerful and something
that's<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:53.850> easy<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.509> change

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
that's very easy to change

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.210 
that's very easy to change
