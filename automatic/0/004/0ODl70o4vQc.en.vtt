the convention center it was a hotel
that<00:01:11.440> was<00:01:12.370> just<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:12.910> mean<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.450> pretty<00:01:13.840> much<00:01:13.930> I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
that was just I mean I pretty much I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.750 
that was just I mean I pretty much I
think<00:01:14.230> it's<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.530> same<00:01:14.710> block<00:01:15.130> as<00:01:15.370> the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
think it's on the same block as the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.150 
think it's on the same block as the

the event was at this this place called

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.110 
the event was at this this place called
the<00:01:38.800> Xbox<00:01:39.159> lounge<00:01:39.400> and<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.670> was<00:01:39.760> really<00:01:39.909> cool

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
the Xbox lounge and it was really cool

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.899 
the Xbox lounge and it was really cool
we<00:01:40.300> played<00:01:40.540> titanfall<00:01:40.990> we<00:01:41.380> played<00:01:41.590> forza<00:01:42.010> we

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
we played titanfall we played forza we

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.380 
we played titanfall we played forza we
played<00:01:43.450> killer<00:01:44.380> instinct<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.970> was<00:01:46.060> all<00:01:46.210> in

tournament<00:01:47.190> settings<00:01:48.190> so<00:01:48.340> i<00:01:48.370> think<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.700> was

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
tournament settings so i think it was
