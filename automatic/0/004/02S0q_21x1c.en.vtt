00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
good thing about this like if you are

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.280 
good thing about this like if you are
not<00:02:50.900> sure<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.590> always<00:02:52.660> do<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.170> know

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
not sure you can always do it you know

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.900 
not sure you can always do it you know
leave<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> little<00:02:54.890> bit<00:02:55.010> out<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.430> then<00:02:55.550> go<00:02:55.700> back

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
leave a little bit out and then go back

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.650 
leave a little bit out and then go back
and<00:02:55.940> clean<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.450> up<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:58.580> an<00:02:58.730> extra<00:02:59.030> step<00:02:59.270> but

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
and clean it up it's an extra step but

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.360 
and clean it up it's an extra step but
just<00:03:00.020> in<00:03:00.140> case<00:03:00.350> you're<00:03:00.560> not<00:03:00.590> sure<00:03:00.800> with<00:03:01.340> what

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
just in case you're not sure with what

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.759 
just in case you're not sure with what
you're<00:03:01.730> doing<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.140> always<00:03:03.500> do<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.739> that

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
you're doing you can always do it that

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:12.550 
you're doing you can always do it that
way<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.680> here's<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.040> finished<00:03:07.160> cut<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.410> you

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
way so here's the finished cut and you

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.380 
way so here's the finished cut and you
know<00:03:12.680> if<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:12.920> come<00:03:13.340> across<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.910> areas

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
know if you come across in the areas

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.780 
know if you come across in the areas
where<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.890> could<00:03:16.100> cut<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> little<00:03:16.580> bit<00:03:16.700> more

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
where you could cut a little bit more

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.410 
where you could cut a little bit more
then<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.690> can<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.050> snip<00:03:18.380> snip<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:20.060> really

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
then you can just snip snip but really

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.500 
then you can just snip snip but really
it<00:03:21.110> doesn't<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.830> be<00:03:21.980> exact<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.180> make

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
it doesn't have to be exact just make

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.840 
it doesn't have to be exact just make
sure<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> front<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.470> you've<00:03:24.680> got<00:03:25.670> it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
sure in the front that you've got it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.800 
sure in the front that you've got it
down<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.810> where<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.110> hair<00:03:27.320> starts<00:03:28.810> that's

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
down to where the hair starts that's

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.390 
down to where the hair starts that's
where<00:03:30.050> it<00:03:30.140> matters<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.709> most

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
where it matters the most

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.750 
where it matters the most
there<00:03:32.120> will<00:03:32.269> also<00:03:32.450> be<00:03:32.630> lace<00:03:32.900> at<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.110> back<00:03:33.350> and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
there will also be lace at the back and

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:43.930 
there will also be lace at the back and
this<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:35.120> like<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> easiest<00:03:35.959> cut<00:03:42.580> snip<00:03:43.580> snip

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
this is like the easiest cut snip snip

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.670 
this is like the easiest cut snip snip
and<00:03:44.209> since<00:03:44.450> it's<00:03:44.600> in<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> back<00:03:44.959> it's<00:03:45.440> much

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
and since it's in the back it's much

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.199 
and since it's in the back it's much
easier<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.519> don't<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.910> worry<00:03:47.060> about

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
easier and you don't have to worry about

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.630 
easier and you don't have to worry about
being<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:47.780> precise<00:03:48.170> okay<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:48.769> here's<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> unit

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
being so precise okay so here's the unit

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.559 
being so precise okay so here's the unit
the<00:03:50.120> line<00:03:50.360> fresh<00:03:51.230> out<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.739> pack<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.420> it's

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
the line fresh out of the pack and it's

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.949 
the line fresh out of the pack and it's
we're<00:03:53.719> really<00:03:54.079> full<00:03:54.409> like<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.269> am<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.329> fan<00:03:56.659> of<00:03:56.689> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
we're really full like I am a fan of the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.670 
we're really full like I am a fan of the
fullness

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
fullness

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.020 
fullness
I<00:03:57.709> think<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.249> density<00:03:58.849> is<00:03:59.450> like<00:04:00.099> 115<00:04:01.099> which<00:04:01.730> is

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
I think the density is like 115 which is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.449 
I think the density is like 115 which is
like<00:04:02.239> on<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.569> higher<00:04:02.749> side<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:04.010> know<00:04:04.159> I<00:04:04.189> love
