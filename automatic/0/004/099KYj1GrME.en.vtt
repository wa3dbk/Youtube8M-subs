00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.979
 that's enough 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.470
 so much I want for all of you guys I am 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.720
 transcribed today I am very happy with 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.119
 bring you the third episode of the series 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.230
 based on video games from movies or 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.970
 books 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.040
 Today I bring you the star wars game 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.769
 battlefront 2 title we already have 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.239
 quoted in the first episode as it is 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.600
 been produced by the developers themselves 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.610
 of the lord of the rings the conquest 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.140
 in fact star wars 42 years is very similar 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.140
 and presents roughly the same 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:59.420
 game dynamics the game released in 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:04.899
 November 1st 2005 for xbox psp ps2 e 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.899
 pc graphics so it's not so bad 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:21.470
 I ran the association we go 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.090
 immediately to analyze it in detail how 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.070
 for the last time we start with 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020
 analyzing at least now divides into 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.400
 four different single items 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.200
 multiplayer screen and options by opening 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.630
 the single item we note that it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 subdivides in turn into five different ones 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.310
 voices or training training 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.500
 space you leave this empire 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.740
 galactic and immediate action 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.530
 let's analyze the one the training 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 as the single of the in the conquest a 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.970
 little tutorial where they will come 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.259
 show the game dynamics 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.939
 Space training is instead a 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.740
 small video where they will be 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.720
 provide the basis for space battles 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.240
 left of the empire is the countryside where 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.939
 impressing soldiers of the 500 a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.970
 esima legion tv stopped the transition to from 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.010
 republic empire the mode with this 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.290
 galactic is divided into five different ones 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 voices the birth of the rebellion the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.769
 revolt of the confederation la 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.570
 sovereignty of the republic 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.090
 the dark of my empire and charge 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.480
 match based on which item we will choose 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.560
 we'll play a different faction again 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.390
 the goal of this mode is 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.579
 conquer all the galaxy with 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.189
 the aid of our spaceship i 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.769
 blue planets are our planets while 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.659
 the red ones are the enemy ones of the year 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.400
 on chrome the enemy planet the ska will keep 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.409
 a land attack 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.359
 but there is also an enemy spaceship 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.689
 that will attack our relatives in 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.430
 any time if l2 spaceships 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.200
 if they meet they will give rise to one 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.299
 I space myself 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.430
 also in this mode we will earn 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.639
 credits will also be used for 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.230
 buy us soldiers or bonuses 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.689
 immediate action instead of the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.060
 instant china correspondent in the 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.239
 lord of the rings the conquest 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.620
 in fact it will be enough for us to choose a faction 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.319
 choose the map to play on and 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.329
 start enjoying ourselves for how long 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.219
 regards the gameplay aspect is yes 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.590
 structure similarly to that of 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.329
 lord of the rings the conquest 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.419
 in fact it will be based mainly on 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.340
 defend and capture positions like 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.780
 we saw in the first episode le 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.659
 classes of the lord of the rings la 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.870
 conquest were all four instead of 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.989
 this game will be a full 64 classes 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.799
 standard ie heavy unit base unit 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.139
 snipers and engineers and two classes 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.489
 specials that will vary from one fazi 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.379
 faction 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.769
 moreover there are also heroes as already 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.810
 this it united lightsaber or 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.819
 special warriors equipped with one 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 detail of existence and the 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.459
 special equipment such as Ian only and 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.709
 judge the battlefield storage heroes 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.599
 2 unlike those of the gentleman 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.699
 of the rings the conquest will be 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.639
 extremely devastating as you see 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.409
 from the background image I am not 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.439
 characterized by particular charisma 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.109
 for which, however, they repeat the same 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.419
 the usual phrases the houses are a lot 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.669
 true to those of the film even though some 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.320
 parts are necessarily invented 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.520
 as the lord of the rings la 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.840
 conquest 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.270
 regarding the mode 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.220
 multiplayer it is nothing but the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.770
 immediate action mode 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.720
 only that instead of bots they will play 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.460
 real players 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.440
 in conclusion this videogame presents 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.930
 greater stability than that of 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.120
 lord of the rings the conquest 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.490
 in fact star wars battlefront 2 offers 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.669
 a much more frenetic style of play 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.889
 and moreover many modes are always 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.830
 ready to offer us leisure and make ourselves 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.419
 have fun again so I would give a nice one 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.240
 seven and a half to this game 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.069
 you instead think about it, write me in 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.580
