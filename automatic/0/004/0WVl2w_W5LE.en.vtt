hello<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.120> tutorial<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.080> new

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hello this is a tutorial on the new

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.780 
hello this is a tutorial on the new
particle<00:00:05.339> texture<00:00:05.670> coordinates<00:00:07.490> let's<00:00:08.490> save

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
particle texture coordinates let's save

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.610 
particle texture coordinates let's save
some<00:00:08.820> time<00:00:09.240> I've<00:00:09.510> already<00:00:09.990> created<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
some time I've already created a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.709 
some time I've already created a
particle<00:00:11.190> system<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.360> very<00:00:12.870> simple<00:00:13.080> one

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
particle system it's a very simple one

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.450 
particle system it's a very simple one
some<00:00:15.719> particles<00:00:16.199> being<00:00:16.500> born<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.100> then

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
some particles being born and then

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.189 
some particles being born and then
there's<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:19.070> turbulence<00:00:20.070> vector<00:00:21.199> creating

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
there's a turbulence vector creating

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.189 
there's a turbulence vector creating
some<00:00:22.380> variation<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> movement<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:27.199> let's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
some variation to the movement so let's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.240 
some variation to the movement so let's
see<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.800> looks<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.300> rendered

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
see it this is how it looks now rendered

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.880 
see it this is how it looks now rendered
to<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> basically<00:00:33.329> no<00:00:33.540> color<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to this basically no color it's the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.740 
to this basically no color it's the
basic<00:00:36.200> halo<00:00:37.200> texture<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:40.050> let's<00:00:40.500> try<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
basic halo texture so now let's try to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.650 
basic halo texture so now let's try to
update<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.260> particles<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
update the particles that are about to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.910 
update the particles that are about to
die<00:00:46.039> here<00:00:47.039> let's<00:00:48.000> try<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> fade<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
die here let's try to fade them to the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.580 
die here let's try to fade them to the
background

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
background

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.689 
background
so<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.860> let's<00:00:53.100> add<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:54.379> material<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.100> set<00:00:56.610> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so first let's add a material and set it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
so first let's add a material and set it
to<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.940> halo<00:01:00.020> hmm<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:02.070> might<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to a halo hmm and you might want to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.840 
to a halo hmm and you might want to
notice<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.170> Alpha<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:05.400> here

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
notice that the Alpha is one here

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.210 
notice that the Alpha is one here
and<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.510> color<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> let's<00:01:07.619> make<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.830> pure

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and the color is let's make it pure

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.630 
and the color is let's make it pure
white<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> do

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
white so now we know what we have to do

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.590 
white so now we know what we have to do
in<00:01:14.640> order<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.530> mix<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:16.830> colors<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.150> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
in order to mix the right colors and in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
in order to mix the right colors and in
what<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> mix<00:01:19.740> them<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.820> for

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
what way we want to mix them to make for

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.490 
what way we want to mix them to make for
example<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.720> Alpha<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.860> zero

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
example the Alpha to zero

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
example the Alpha to zero
next<00:01:25.500> let's<00:01:25.799> add<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> texture<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> want

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
next let's add a texture and now I want

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.050 
next let's add a texture and now I want
to<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> blend<00:01:30.000> texture<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.759> you'll<00:01:32.759> see

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to use a blend texture and you'll see

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.010 
to use a blend texture and you'll see
why<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.439> second<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> main<00:01:36.780> thing

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
why in just a second so the main thing

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.850 
why in just a second so the main thing
is<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> want<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.270> new<00:01:40.020> feature<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
is if you want to use the new feature is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630 
is if you want to use the new feature is
to<00:01:41.280> change<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> pot<00:01:42.600> texture<00:01:43.290> coordinates<00:01:43.740> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
to change the pot texture coordinates to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210 
to change the pot texture coordinates to
these<00:01:44.820> travel<00:01:45.600> particle<00:01:46.110> coordinates<00:01:46.619> from

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
these travel particle coordinates from

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.859 
these travel particle coordinates from
the<00:01:47.460> default<00:01:47.909> generated<00:01:49.399> coordinates<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
the default generated coordinates and

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.550 
the default generated coordinates and
what<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> does<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.369> normal<00:01:53.369> particles<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
what that does for normal particles is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.929 
what that does for normal particles is
it<00:01:55.560> uses<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.659> x-axis<00:01:57.659> value<00:01:58.759> for<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it uses the x-axis value for the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.679 
it uses the x-axis value for the
lifetime<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.259> particle<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.479> should

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
lifetime of the particle so we should

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.180 
lifetime of the particle so we should
see<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.170> straight<00:02:04.710> away<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.820> render<00:02:06.299> it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
see that straight away if we render it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.690 
see that straight away if we render it
we<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.310> some<00:02:08.489> color<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:10.160> why<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.220> happens

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
we have some color and why this happens

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.900 
we have some color and why this happens
is<00:02:12.510> all<00:02:12.900> pink

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
is all pink

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.790 
is all pink
is<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:16.850> greyscale<00:02:17.690> texture<00:02:18.140> currently

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
is that this greyscale texture currently

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.590 
is that this greyscale texture currently
so<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.490> uses<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.030> color<00:02:20.510> given<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:23.360> apply

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
so it uses the color given here to apply

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.690 
so it uses the color given here to apply
the<00:02:24.700> texture<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.320> override<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.010> by

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the texture but we can override that by

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.460 
the texture but we can override that by
using<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.210> ramp<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:31.700> also<00:02:32.320> since<00:02:33.320> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
using a ramp and we also since the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.070 
using a ramp and we also since the
mixing<00:02:33.800> isn't<00:02:34.070> really<00:02:34.310> working<00:02:34.490> for<00:02:35.420> that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
mixing isn't really working for that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.990 
mixing isn't really working for that
well<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:36.770> we'll<00:02:37.250> change<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.910> multiply<00:02:40.000> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
well so we'll change it to multiply and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.590 
well so we'll change it to multiply and
for<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:41.870> let's<00:02:42.170> set<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.770> alpha<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.520> 1<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.480> we

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
for now let's set the alpha to 1 so we

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.010 
for now let's set the alpha to 1 so we
can<00:02:44.630> actually<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.200> what<00:02:45.380> things<00:02:45.620> she<00:02:45.860> does<00:02:47.020> so

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
can actually see what things she does so

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.410 
can actually see what things she does so
it<00:02:48.170> starts<00:02:48.500> out<00:02:48.620> black<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.120> turns

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
it starts out black and then it turns

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.330 
it starts out black and then it turns
into<00:02:50.570> white<00:02:51.130> let's<00:02:52.130> see<00:02:52.310> how<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.520> looks

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
into white let's see how that looks

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.730 
into white let's see how that looks
yeah<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.610> works<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.870> really<00:03:00.290> nice<00:03:00.440> way<00:03:00.710> to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
yeah it works so this really nice way to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.000 
yeah it works so this really nice way to
actually<00:03:01.400> see<00:03:01.970> how<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.810> particle<00:03:03.740> colors

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
actually see how the particle colors

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.950 
actually see how the particle colors
will<00:03:04.220> change<00:03:04.490> in<00:03:05.030> time<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.830> edge<00:03:07.460> here

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
will change in time so this edge here

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.720 
will change in time so this edge here
the<00:03:08.960> beginning<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.690> part<00:03:11.900> where<00:03:12.730> the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the beginning is the part where the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.800 
the beginning is the part where the
particle<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.390> born<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:14.990> end<00:03:15.950> part<00:03:16.370> here

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
particle is born and the end part here

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.810 
particle is born and the end part here
very<00:03:17.810> right<00:03:18.020> is<00:03:18.320> when<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.920> particle<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.640> going

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
very right is when the particle is going

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.800 
very right is when the particle is going
to<00:03:20.000> die<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.980> now<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:22.610> just<00:03:22.790> for<00:03:23.390> example

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
to die so now we can just for example

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.600 
to die so now we can just for example
take<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.440> point<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.140> change<00:03:27.140> its<00:03:27.410> alpha<00:03:28.190> to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
take this point and change its alpha to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.420 
take this point and change its alpha to
zero<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:31.010> we<00:03:31.280> also<00:03:31.490> want<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:33.130> influence<00:03:34.130> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
zero and we also want to influence the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.560 
zero and we also want to influence the
outer<00:03:34.580> here<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:36.380> then<00:03:36.740> just<00:03:36.980> render<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.420> they

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
outer here and then just render and they

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.890 
outer here and then just render and they
fade<00:03:38.750> away<00:03:38.780> nicely<00:03:42.610> now<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.360> make<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.720> bit

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
fade away nicely now to make it a bit

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.729 
fade away nicely now to make it a bit
for<00:03:45.500> example<00:03:46.190> morph<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:46.910> like<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:48.470> said

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
for example morph I like it said

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.120 
for example morph I like it said
something<00:03:49.220> gray<00:03:49.970> here<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:53.320> for<00:03:54.320> example<00:03:54.560> make

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
something gray here and for example make

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.800 
something gray here and for example make
it<00:03:55.280> red<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.360> middle<00:03:56.630> part<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.970> let's<00:03:59.660> make

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it red in the middle part and let's make

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.100 
it red in the middle part and let's make
it<00:03:59.870> pure<00:04:00.230> white<00:04:03.040> in<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.190> very<00:04:04.370> beginning

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
it pure white in the very beginning

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it pure white in the very beginning
perhaps<00:04:06.110> let's<00:04:06.470> add<00:04:06.650> some<00:04:06.890> yellow<00:04:07.160> here<00:04:07.610> too

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.910 

right<00:04:13.130> sir<00:04:14.140> okay<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.740> then<00:04:16.400> let's<00:04:16.730> make<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.920> is

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
right sir okay and then let's make it is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.450 
right sir okay and then let's make it is
the<00:04:19.160> add<00:04:19.310> value<00:04:20.300> and<00:04:22.870> there<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.990> have<00:04:24.020> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
the add value and there you have it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.760 
the add value and there you have it
maybe<00:04:25.460> perhaps<00:04:25.640> we<00:04:26.000> should<00:04:26.470> decrease<00:04:27.470> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
maybe perhaps we should decrease the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.740 
maybe perhaps we should decrease the
overall<00:04:28.130> alpha<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:29.240> little<00:04:29.720> bit<00:04:34.420> okay<00:04:35.420> I'm<00:04:35.570> now

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
overall alpha a little bit okay I'm now

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.040 
overall alpha a little bit okay I'm now
artists<00:04:36.410> but<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:37.460> get<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.790> idea<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.960> really

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
artists but you get the idea it's really

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.440 
artists but you get the idea it's really
nice<00:04:39.410> because<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.770> can<00:04:39.950> actually<00:04:40.640> see<00:04:41.090> what

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
nice because you can actually see what

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.010 
nice because you can actually see what
happens<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:43.550> particle<00:04:44.000> colors<00:04:44.450> really<00:04:44.810> look

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
happens the particle colors really look

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.210 
happens the particle colors really look
like<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:46.010> rub<00:04:46.190> here<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:48.590> that's<00:04:48.770> basically

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
like the rub here so that's basically

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.490 
like the rub here so that's basically
the<00:04:49.340> idea<00:04:49.490> for<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:52.960> lifetime<00:04:53.960> coordinate

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
the idea for the lifetime coordinate

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.010 
the idea for the lifetime coordinate
which<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:54.980> on<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> x-axis<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:56.540> is<00:04:56.690> why<00:04:56.810> we

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
which is on the x-axis this is why we

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.700 
which is on the x-axis this is why we
use<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:58.090> horizontal<00:04:59.090> blend<00:04:59.570> file<00:04:59.840> a<00:05:00.140> blend

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
use the a horizontal blend file a blend

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.580 
use the a horizontal blend file a blend
texture<00:05:01.040> sorry

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
texture sorry

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.750 
texture sorry
so<00:05:03.640> another<00:05:04.640> picture<00:05:05.470> with<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.760> texture

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
so another picture with the texture

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.540 
so another picture with the texture
coordinates<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.710> if<00:05:09.710> we<00:05:10.390> add<00:05:11.390> some<00:05:12.140> trails<00:05:12.980> to

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
coordinates is if we add some trails to

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.390 
coordinates is if we add some trails to
the<00:05:13.670> particles<00:05:16.810> let's<00:05:17.810> set<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.380> length<00:05:18.800> to

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
the particles let's set the length to

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.420 
the particles let's set the length to
something<00:05:20.030> a<00:05:20.180> little<00:05:20.300> bit<00:05:20.420> smaller<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:24.430> now

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
something a little bit smaller so now

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.170 
something a little bit smaller so now
the<00:05:26.060> y-axis<00:05:26.780> can<00:05:27.230> be<00:05:27.380> used<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:28.190> set<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.730> texture

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
the y-axis can be used to set a texture

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.220 
the y-axis can be used to set a texture
along<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.660> trails<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:31.570> might<00:05:32.570> also<00:05:32.750> want<00:05:33.140> to

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
along the trails I might also want to

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.300 
along the trails I might also want to
put<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.310> size<00:05:34.550> down<00:05:38.320> like<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.530> because<00:05:40.130> we

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
put the size down like that because we

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.100 
put the size down like that because we
have<00:05:40.490> now<00:05:40.730> a<00:05:40.760> lot<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.090> what<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.660> lot<00:05:41.900> more

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
have now a lot of what a lot more

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.740 
have now a lot of what a lot more
particles<00:05:42.680> here<00:05:43.480> do<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.720> trails<00:05:46.630> so<00:05:47.630> now

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
particles here do to the trails so now

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.690 
particles here do to the trails so now
if<00:05:47.960> we<00:05:48.200> render<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:48.890> using<00:05:49.430> a<00:05:49.520> horizontal

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
if we render it using a horizontal

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:56.890 
if we render it using a horizontal
texture<00:05:51.670> we<00:05:52.670> simply<00:05:53.000> get<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:55.720> particle<00:05:56.720> color

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
texture we simply get the particle color

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.320 
texture we simply get the particle color
from<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.440> lifetime<00:05:58.570> but<00:05:59.570> if<00:05:59.900> we<00:06:00.280> use<00:06:01.280> a

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
from the lifetime but if we use a

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.260 
from the lifetime but if we use a
vertical<00:06:02.330> texture<00:06:04.870> the<00:06:05.870> ramp<00:06:06.020> applies<00:06:06.410> to<00:06:07.270> the

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
vertical texture the ramp applies to the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.780 
vertical texture the ramp applies to the
actual<00:06:08.660> length<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.890> trail<00:06:12.400> so<00:06:13.400> now<00:06:13.550> each

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
actual length of the trail so now each

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.960 
actual length of the trail so now each
maverick<00:06:14.330> trail<00:06:15.430> starts<00:06:16.430> up<00:06:16.900> white

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
maverick trail starts up white

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.900 
maverick trail starts up white
from<00:06:19.960> bottom<00:06:20.770> here<00:06:21.040> where<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.580> actual

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
from bottom here where the actual

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.320 
from bottom here where the actual
particle<00:06:22.390> is<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:23.470> trail<00:06:23.790> slowly<00:06:24.790> turns

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
particle is and the trail slowly turns

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.910 
particle is and the trail slowly turns
into<00:06:26.880> these<00:06:27.880> colors<00:06:28.270> that<00:06:28.450> are<00:06:28.620> higher<00:06:29.620> and

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
into these colors that are higher and

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.390 
into these colors that are higher and
higher<00:06:30.100> and<00:06:31.410> what's<00:06:32.410> great<00:06:32.680> about<00:06:32.740> this<00:06:33.100> is

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
higher and what's great about this is

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.030 
higher and what's great about this is
that<00:06:33.460> you<00:06:33.730> can<00:06:33.880> of<00:06:33.970> course<00:06:34.000> apply<00:06:35.040> however

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
that you can of course apply however

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.250 
that you can of course apply however
many<00:06:36.280> textures<00:06:36.790> you<00:06:37.060> want<00:06:37.270> and<00:06:37.510> stack<00:06:38.020> them

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
many textures you want and stack them

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.630 
many textures you want and stack them
and<00:06:38.470> lay<00:06:39.280> it<00:06:39.490> just<00:06:39.700> like<00:06:39.880> normal<00:06:40.060> textures<00:06:41.640> the

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
and lay it just like normal textures the

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.880 
and lay it just like normal textures the
other<00:06:42.910> thing<00:06:43.150> to<00:06:43.330> remember<00:06:43.570> is<00:06:43.990> that<00:06:44.050> with<00:06:44.680> the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
other thing to remember is that with the

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.540 
other thing to remember is that with the
particle<00:06:45.880> coordinates<00:06:46.330> x<00:06:47.230> axis<00:06:47.650> is<00:06:47.980> for<00:06:48.340> the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
particle coordinates x axis is for the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.890 
particle coordinates x axis is for the
lifetime<00:06:49.240> and<00:06:49.480> the<00:06:50.350> y<00:06:50.530> axis<00:06:50.890> is<00:06:51.390> for<00:06:52.390> the<00:06:52.540> trail

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
lifetime and the y axis is for the trail

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.660 
lifetime and the y axis is for the trail
coordinates<00:06:55.620> okay<00:06:56.620> thanks<00:06:56.950> for<00:06:56.980> watching<00:06:57.100> and

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
coordinates okay thanks for watching and

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.820 
coordinates okay thanks for watching and
I<00:06:57.700> hope<00:06:58.510> you<00:06:58.720> have<00:06:58.840> a<00:06:58.870> nice<00:06:59.200> time<00:06:59.440> playing<00:06:59.650> with

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
I hope you have a nice time playing with

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.710 
I hope you have a nice time playing with
this<00:07:00.010> new<00:07:00.490> feature<00:07:01.530> bye<00:07:02.530> bye
