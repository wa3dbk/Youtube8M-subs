00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.939
 cell phone you can only call and send 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.050
 dollars and no good balance now if

 the word band 1 to 333 good you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.170

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 a new message with a bit of fucking 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.140

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.440

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.359
 we answer ok the last message that you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 your package is going to come out like this 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.280
 will be ready within a maximum of two 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 hours but that's a lie will be ready 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 in half an hour or more 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.300
 You can send a message with the word 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.030
 Internet to 654 if it does not come out 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.280
 internet on demand is because I already 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.940
 you have another active package or if it comes out 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 an error sending the message 654 is 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.550
 because you have to wait more good this 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.500
 it's all I hope it serves them remember 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.020
 that you will have your own three dollars 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.820
