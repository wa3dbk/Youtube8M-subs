00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so the idea what i asked for was like I

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.360 
so the idea what i asked for was like I
still<00:03:28.349> wanted<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.830> not<00:03:29.099> necessarily

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
still wanted to do not necessarily

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.210 
still wanted to do not necessarily
hambre<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.450> liked<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:31.080> dark<00:03:31.349> roots<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.069> like

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
hambre but I liked my dark roots I like

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.520 
hambre but I liked my dark roots I like
the<00:03:32.310> contrast<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.940> color<00:03:33.209> but<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.110> feel<00:03:34.319> like<00:03:34.349> it

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
the contrast in color but I feel like it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.800 
the contrast in color but I feel like it
was<00:03:34.590> too<00:03:34.799> dark<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.340> bottom<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.569> still

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
was too dark on the bottom so it's still

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.930 
was too dark on the bottom so it's still
a<00:03:36.840> little<00:03:37.110> dark<00:03:37.590> here<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.040> she<00:03:38.340> added<00:03:38.549> more

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
a little dark here but she added more

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.339 
a little dark here but she added more
color<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:40.319> up<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.370> it's<00:03:41.730> more<00:03:41.940> ombre<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
color going up so it's more ombre on the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.270 
color going up so it's more ombre on the
bottom<00:03:43.860> here<00:03:44.430> um<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:45.989> she<00:03:46.280> really

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
bottom here um and then she really

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.900 
bottom here um and then she really
lightened<00:03:47.670> up<00:03:47.819> that<00:03:48.150> ends<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:50.220> caught<00:03:50.549> off

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
lightened up that ends and we caught off

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.309 
lightened up that ends and we caught off
about<00:03:51.450> six<00:03:51.870> inches<00:03:52.230> um<00:03:53.780> that's<00:03:54.780> right<00:03:55.079> on<00:03:55.230> my

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
about six inches um that's right on my

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.300 
about six inches um that's right on my
bust<00:03:55.819> so<00:03:56.819> yeah<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.859> I'm<00:03:59.040> not

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
bust so yeah I really like it I'm not

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.940 
bust so yeah I really like it I'm not
used<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.510> because<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:01.079> know<00:04:01.410> my<00:04:01.680> hair<00:04:01.859> is

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
used to it because I know my hair is

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.400 
used to it because I know my hair is
still<00:04:02.220> technically<00:04:03.180> long<00:04:03.629> but<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.260> is

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
still technically long but this is

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.099 
still technically long but this is
probably<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.129> shortest<00:04:06.120> my<00:04:06.480> hair<00:04:06.690> has<00:04:06.870> been

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
probably the shortest my hair has been

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.479 
probably the shortest my hair has been
in<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.799> least<00:04:08.030> three<00:04:09.319> or<00:04:10.319> four<00:04:10.560> years<00:04:10.859> my

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
in at least three or four years my

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.830 
in at least three or four years my
hair's<00:04:11.730> always<00:04:11.910> been<00:04:12.209> super<00:04:13.170> long<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.840> feel

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
hair's always been super long so I feel

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.279 
hair's always been super long so I feel
so<00:04:16.199> much<00:04:16.380> healthier<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:17.519> can<00:04:18.299> pull<00:04:18.810> my<00:04:19.049> hair

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
so much healthier I can pull my hair

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.779 
so much healthier I can pull my hair
through<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.650> like<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.829> doesn't<00:04:20.039> feel<00:04:20.130> dead<00:04:20.489> or

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
through it like it doesn't feel dead or

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.930 
through it like it doesn't feel dead or
dry<00:04:21.120> um<00:04:21.710> so<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.099> looks<00:04:23.370> shinier<00:04:23.849> and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
dry um so it just looks shinier and

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.170 
dry um so it just looks shinier and
nicer<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:25.260> I'm<00:04:25.349> excited<00:04:25.590> for<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.849> and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
nicer so I'm excited for that I just and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.170 
nicer so I'm excited for that I just and
she<00:04:27.599> trimmed<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.520> reshaped<00:04:29.520> like<00:04:29.729> my<00:04:29.910> face

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
she trimmed up reshaped like my face

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.260 
she trimmed up reshaped like my face
like<00:04:30.660> around<00:04:31.590> my<00:04:31.740> face<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.880> blends<00:04:33.120> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
like around my face so it blends a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.540 
like around my face so it blends a
little<00:04:33.479> easier<00:04:33.720> but<00:04:33.990> yeah<00:04:34.710> that's<00:04:35.070> my<00:04:35.340> new
