00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
what we're looking at we started the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
what we're looking at we started the
eyebrows<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:29.250> you're

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
eyebrows now as you can see if you're

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.740 
eyebrows now as you can see if you're
looking<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:29.789> each<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.330> thinking<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
looking at each of them just thinking is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.139 
looking at each of them just thinking is
it<00:00:30.929> more<00:00:31.170> curved<00:00:31.529> or<00:00:31.830> more<00:00:32.070> angular<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.910> its

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it more curved or more angular in its

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
it more curved or more angular in its
feeling<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> look<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.710> eyebrows<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
feeling if you look at my eyebrows you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.889 
feeling if you look at my eyebrows you
can<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.640> they're<00:00:35.820> fairly<00:00:36.239> straight<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.690> don't

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
can see they're fairly straight I don't

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
can see they're fairly straight I don't
have<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.260> arched<00:00:37.890> eyebrows<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.940> fairly

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
have very arched eyebrows I have fairly

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.959 
have very arched eyebrows I have fairly
straight<00:00:39.840> eyebrows<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.280> eyebrows<00:00:41.760> would

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
straight eyebrows so my eyebrows would

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
straight eyebrows so my eyebrows would
be<00:00:42.059> considered<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.690> straight<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> look

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
be considered to be straight if you look

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180 
be considered to be straight if you look
at<00:00:44.309> my<00:00:44.430> eyes<00:00:44.610> they're<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:45.989> big<00:00:46.350> round

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
at my eyes they're not really big round

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.060 
at my eyes they're not really big round
eyes<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.210> fairly<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:48.840> almond<00:00:49.320> shape<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
eyes but fairly more almond shape so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.979 
eyes but fairly more almond shape so
again<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.789> fits<00:00:51.059> more<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> straighter

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
again that fits more into the straighter

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.040 
again that fits more into the straighter
category<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:53.879> nose<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
category if you look at my nose it's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
category if you look at my nose it's
straight<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:58.350> also<00:00:58.620> quite<00:00:59.100> pointy

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
straight here and it's also quite pointy

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
straight here and it's also quite pointy
and<00:00:59.699> straight<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> end<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and straight at the end I don't have a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.340 
and straight at the end I don't have a
rounded<00:01:02.039> nose<00:01:02.340> tip<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.870> roundness

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
rounded nose tip or a lot of roundness

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
rounded nose tip or a lot of roundness
through<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> sides<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:05.760> nose<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.570> nose

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
through the sides of our nose so my nose

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
through the sides of our nose so my nose
is<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.530> considered<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.100> quite<00:01:08.430> straight

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is also considered to be quite straight

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
is also considered to be quite straight
if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.200> my<00:01:10.320> lips<00:01:10.619> they're<00:01:11.280> not

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if you look at my lips they're not

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
if you look at my lips they're not
really<00:01:11.820> big<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.420> full<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.500> also<00:01:13.710> not

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
really big and full but they're also not

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
really big and full but they're also not
very<00:01:14.040> thin<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> straight<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.360> they're

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
very thin and straight so they're

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
very thin and straight so they're
actually<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.100> more<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
actually a little bit more into the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
actually a little bit more into the
curved<00:01:18.119> category<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> final<00:01:20.250> thing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
curved category and then the final thing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
curved category and then the final thing
is<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> jaw<00:01:21.180> shape<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.290> chin<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
is the jaw shape so that your chin in

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
is the jaw shape so that your chin in
your<00:01:22.890> jaw<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> see<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.720> look<00:01:24.750> at

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
your jaw as you can see if you look at

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.520 
your jaw as you can see if you look at
mine<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.680> quite<00:01:26.100> curved<00:01:27.049> some<00:01:28.049> people<00:01:28.320> have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
mine it's quite curved some people have

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.649 
mine it's quite curved some people have
quite<00:01:28.829> square<00:01:29.250> doors<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> feel<00:01:30.360> your

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
quite square doors where you feel your

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.560 
quite square doors where you feel your
seams<00:01:30.900> straighter<00:01:31.470> lines<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:33.000> would<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
seams straighter lines that would be a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.640 
seams straighter lines that would be a
straighter<00:01:34.110> jaw

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
straighter jaw

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.429 
straighter jaw
so<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.790> overall<00:01:36.090> defining<00:01:36.840> features<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> what

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so my overall defining features is what

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.090 
so my overall defining features is what
we<00:01:37.530> call<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> combination<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.810> couple<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
we call a combination a couple of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
we call a combination a couple of
straight<00:01:41.100> curved<00:01:41.820> elements<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> rest<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
straight curved elements and the rest of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
straight curved elements and the rest of
them<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:42.960> straight<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.119> combination

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
them are straight so I'm a combination

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.010 
them are straight so I'm a combination
of<00:01:45.320> curved<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> straight<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:48.840> I'm

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of curved but and straight so when I'm

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
of curved but and straight so when I'm
looking<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.470> things<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.799> necklines<00:01:50.579> your

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
looking at things like necklines your
