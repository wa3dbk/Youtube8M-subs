00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.450
 Talk also to our tutorial 3 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.790
 I'll tell you now, explain here. 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.929
 how to install the track inside the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.809
 bar fact here 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.850
 this is a very simple way it 's easy 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 too much to do this 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.310
 anyone you download and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.820
 any link after you is to get the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.880
 archive 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.950
 I 'm here with an adult who's 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.280
 doing forfun in the Netherlands 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:44.510
 apply extract here 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:47.600
 usually the lanes come with a paste 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.500
 with the name of the track, right? 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.469
 ie reading fact there is the folder 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.469
 locations within the game data folder 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.619
 I downloaded the track here to extract the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.750
 accountability that take it or 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:16.189
 copy the sap is here there will pity 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.189
 of betrayed peace is a factor 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.870
 inside the game data folder 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.290
 sought the folder locations here just the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 opel cheese I've already put the folder here 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.210
 in already has installed and takes only and 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.450
 here in this locations folder and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.270
 necklace bets in here 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.130
 It's all for that if you find another one. 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.860
 track you want to play 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.620
 you can download the track do not extract the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.290
 sometimes it comes with 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.160
 which game data folder is it? 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.770
 together, just copy and paste here 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.140
 bet location is usually the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.670
 interesting you only pick up the folder 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.270
 with the name that has the name of the track that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.080
 all point files but here map the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:16.880
 gb that your graphics here and put 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.460
 within the location folder 2.15 programs 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.940
 it was a fact that the folder is the game 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:31.459
 data locations gets picked up and glued to the track 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.430
 here only this is done 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.970
 now let's see how the track 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.970
 inside the game 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.870
 Over time you had a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.580
 Score here on tv that's thomson 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.989
 greater good I can not even buy 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.220
 willingness to take advantage of the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.310
 edis pass fast over here is like 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.600
 choose another vehicle that had 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.820
 started to show you in total 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.489
 past 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.090
 if I want to buy the kingdom here now 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.030
 newspaper design here hat 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.760
 cap 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.380
 if I want to buy it from the baby 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.239
 I think I even bought it because I spent 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.550
 all my score I had already 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.090
 I understand I had not spent the punctuation 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.760
 of fulfilling several cars 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.480
 Let's buy that for example I would pick up 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:35.540
 brabham niki lauda 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:44.120
 the rate also already bought gold already 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:47.000
 I bought all the cases in our pq 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.010
 all this is the culprit because what I did 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.660
 The code was for you guys to get all 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.069
 the expensive is not worth 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:03.230
 So, to see what the problem is, it's over. 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:07.930
 in management here ok let's go to the track 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:14.150
 Let's go to the track here. 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:19.639
 meet in week play test train the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.010
 fla in test the track goes around there, right? 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.840

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.380
 Default that comes with this lack, right? 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.120
 knife only see this clue here you can 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.740
 occur normally 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.840
 and all tracks are installed in that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.180
 folder location that I explained there all 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:54.729
 will appear here as much as a test 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:05:09.830
 sofas a week and can choose a 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:10.669
 pilot you are a normal race is 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.740
 shorter 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.349
 if I had it here and another 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.280
 version of it here that cyclical and 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:25.130
 appeared yesterday the day before yesterday clicked the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.970
 second lane loaded will carry 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.460
 track here already appears here 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.139
 the loading screen to enter the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.510
 track 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.960
 this applies to any other type of 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.960
 track 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.360
 usually the pattern was fact to happen 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.999
 choose a weekend to make a 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.139
 simple run but always loads 10 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:56.080
