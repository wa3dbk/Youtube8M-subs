00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.150
 how do you live supplement program 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.299
 in paris i went back to a club 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.099
 hairdresser where I made competitions the 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.690
 passion is nothing at that moment what and 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.800
 I actually discovered that it is 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.470
 a job where there was still 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.940
 many facets in the center 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.610
 killer and especially a job 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.260
 extraordinary in which one can 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.860
 open your own living room 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.030
 so that's still great 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.030
 today count a youngster in this 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.430
 job obviously yes it's a job 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.510
 every day I repeat it I put some 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.700
 bars that come with their children 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.440
 with this reluctance go from really 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.210
 to do the hairstyle but hey it does not pay 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.350
 not yet wanted them to do 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.450
 studies so tell them they're wrong 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.700
 people do not realize the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.620
 such possibilities as that France 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.530
 it's a great job where you can 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.630
 flourish where we can evolve to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.910
 transform and what can I 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.009
 tell you more than my example what 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.799
 finally at nantes what I have is 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.149
 me today a young can do it again 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.670
 me when I started I was told here 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.740
 the slow tuque but it's too late 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.289
 i have gets in its no it's always 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.819
 possible transmission is essential 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.889
 and that's the future of our profession 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.740
 because if we do not train young people 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:25.959
 maquis bat that is going to be in the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.369
 salons that will work that some 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.770
 in the living room in the butcher shops in 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.959
 the pastry shop or the bakery 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.899
 the important thing is to be happy 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.259
 happy about what we do get up the 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.549
 morning 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.869
 I say I've never worked what 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.060
 I do I always do it because 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.099
 I like doing it and so from the moment 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.659
 we like things do not have not 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.649
 working is a real pleasure 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.599
 I have a pair of scissors junpei and if 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.789
 I would put this job I can 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.340
 restart 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.299
 anywhere no matter how in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.859
 any country 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.330
 that's all we need 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:03.730
 master this job 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.660
 hence the information from where learning 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.660
 That's what's important 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.670
