I'm Lisa this is something of a
discussion<00:00:12.210> video<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.929> something<00:00:13.740> that

discussion video about something that

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.980 
discussion video about something that
I've<00:00:13.980> noticed<00:00:14.460> throughout<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.599> last<00:00:15.780> year

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
I've noticed throughout the last year

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
I've noticed throughout the last year
that<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.320> been<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.770> booktube<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.340> it's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
that I've been on booktube and it's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.340 
that I've been on booktube and it's
something<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:20.240> actually<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.050> really

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
something that actually kind of really

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.450 
something that actually kind of really
worries<00:00:22.710> me<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.720> unofficial<00:00:25.710> code

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
worries me and it is the unofficial code

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.450 
worries me and it is the unofficial code
of<00:00:26.609> silence<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> seems<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> exist<00:00:28.980> when

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of silence that it seems to exist when

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.600 
of silence that it seems to exist when
it<00:00:29.609> comes<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.210> queer<00:00:30.720> books<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:32.309> means

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
it comes to queer books and that means

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.020 
it comes to queer books and that means
that<00:00:33.120> book<00:00:33.960> tubers<00:00:34.260> whether<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.370> little

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
middle generally won't say outright when

okay so I've noticed it mostly quite

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670

queer book and say that you loved it and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.030 
queer book and say that you loved it and
it<00:02:19.329> was<00:02:19.450> amazing<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:20.140> everyone<00:02:20.470> should<00:02:20.769> read

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it was amazing and everyone should read

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.119 
it was amazing and everyone should read
it<00:02:21.189> right<00:02:21.370> away<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.379> there's<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.439> love<00:02:23.769> story

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
it right away and there's a love story

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.729 
it right away and there's a love story
in<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.670> but<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.450> don't<00:02:25.780> tell<00:02:26.260> them<00:02:26.530> that's

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
in it but you don't tell them that's

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.319 
in it but you don't tell them that's
it's<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.519> queer<00:02:27.879> one<00:02:28.739> then<00:02:29.739> that's<00:02:29.920> erasure<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
it's a queer one then that's erasure and

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.199 
it's a queer one then that's erasure and
that<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.019> serious<00:02:32.730> serious<00:02:33.730> problem

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
that is a serious serious problem

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.710 
that is a serious serious problem
because<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.950> book<00:02:36.159> has<00:02:36.579> queer<00:02:36.970> protagonists

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
because if a book has queer protagonists

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.089 
because if a book has queer protagonists
and<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.019> published<00:02:38.200> by<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> traditional

successful that is a big deal that does

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.349 
successful that is a big deal that does

more<00:02:46.510> now<00:02:46.720> than<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.049> ever<00:02:47.170> has<00:02:47.470> before<00:02:47.620> but

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
more now than it ever has before but

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.280 
more now than it ever has before but
it's<00:02:48.159> still<00:02:48.310> not<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:49.030> widespread<00:02:49.750> as<00:02:50.230> it

should be so if you read that book and

should be so if you read that book and
you<00:02:52.659> don't<00:02:52.900> tell<00:02:53.109> people<00:02:53.500> then<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:53.799> queer

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
you don't tell people then it's queer

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.910 
you don't tell people then it's queer
then<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.420> are<00:02:55.569> negating<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> fact<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.680> it

then you are negating the fact that it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.580 
then you are negating the fact that it
is<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:58.209> are<00:02:58.359> hiding<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.930> fact<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.440> is

tell them that it's a queer book then

do that and that's really really wrong

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.539 
do that and that's really really wrong
and<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:40.660> don't<00:03:40.930> understand<00:03:41.530> why<00:03:41.889> people<00:03:42.250> are<00:03:42.340> so

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.099 
hesitant to say that a book is a queer
book<00:03:44.949> is<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:46.150> because<00:03:46.480> they're<00:03:46.720> afraid<00:03:46.989> that

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
book is it because they're afraid that

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.659 
book is it because they're afraid that

we'll lose followers if they openly

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.339 
we'll lose followers if they openly
