00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 in that there is corner shot in favor of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.220
 sport huancayo 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.809
 have to hurry sport huancayo if 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.660
 wants to get the street tie the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.480
 street to make the corner kick 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.900
 jose street 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.279
 open the center up nick montalva de 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 head and to the sack 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.239
 now the moon ran to mark it 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.759
 click on transit just the referee 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:33.990
 diego haro would vote mendoza does not have 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.250
 to throw at random with yellow 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.250
 jose for fool 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.460
 that rice is not so small anymore 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.330
 the shock is of both really what 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.860
 happens that he wins a bit the position one 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.810
 what it will do is put any 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.270
 forward feel the shock back is pulled 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.950
 the referee seeing the perspective of the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.950
 move will mean missing since 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.230
 you can not win a variety 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.230
 good but 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 I have seen many cases like this here in the south 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.760
 or ours 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 experience 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 it's not the first time he let himself be carried away 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 because even it is already the fourth palm 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 from the applause I was already sorry 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.159
 but it was late 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.700
 wind 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.640
 that is critical, it is critical 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.600
 we had not seen it for a long time 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.700
 but he is taking it out to mendoza 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 to claim he wants to do justice 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.740
 by his hands with his hands 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.399
 ekl rebuke the referee anyway 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.130
 yes but good but but the other is 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.939
 that they take it out but can not enter it is not 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.000
 now that he take for the inclusive 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.250
 stated that he was with a psychologist to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.250
 this kind of reaction is why 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.530
 he was always going to sit on the bench 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.289
 Look, he went and left his collaborator more 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.849
 close to be there good this one 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.930
 is giving away the money the psychologist is 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.930
 a very bad psychologist 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.490
 we had not seen it for a long time 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.620
 reaction of being paralyzed paralyzed 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.350
 the actions but good 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.920
 I dont know 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.920
 yes 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.120
 of grief 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.120
 Well it 's a shame because we're going 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.550
 I do not get it 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.730
 collective rebellion or the referee has 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.790
 finished the match one of two 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.959
 and now he's going to see her and now comes the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.959
 sancochado white against red 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.240
 a party that although there had been 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.470
 plays 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.840
 confused this 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.550
 on one side or the other but not on any 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.000
 there was a bad intention 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.829
 intention and very clear 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.599
 expelled but clear but beware of the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.599
 accurate report this 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.760
 but I want to take advantage of this paralysis 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.099
 skinny this by Juan Carlos and allows me 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.049
 look like greeting gonzalo lopez friend has 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.970
 come from japan from exclusively to see 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.360
 Peruvian soccer and it seems that it's going 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.360
 righ now 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.940
 those who are outside have not helped in 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.940
 absolute has calmed down 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.830
 on the contrary, they are the ones who have gone and have 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.500
 burned down let's say the prairie 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.840
 this is very simple 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.480
 what Mendoza finally generates the 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.180
 reaction the exabrupto of marcelo 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.230
 trobbiani thank you and already with the income of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.510
 marcelo trobbiani and that reaction I insist 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.720
 unbridled is what ends up causing 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.840
 this is here and let's not throw the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.209
 blame this time to win my time and 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.400
 we navigate in the responsibility of saying 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.160
 Aro has made a bad bad to 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.340
 arbitration the arbitration has been within 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.950
 of the correct is normal did not affect for 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.540
 nothing in the outcome of the game and that 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.480
 we have to make everything very clear 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.510
 others are reprehensible things that you have to 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.160
 you have to leave them completely aside and 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.050
 that the justice commission at the end is going 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.460
 to have to put a strong hand on that 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.410
 hour the people who follow us who do not see 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.470
 Juan Carlos knows perfectly well that 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.610
 remove the strip and here we always try 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.240
 to be as objective as possible 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.560
 cold analytical objectives do not and in this 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.689
 case as well as other opportunities 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.150
 we have criticized the organized the 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.560
 performance of the referees we have not 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.500
 censored the performance of the referees 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.620
 today we have to say that arbitration 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.900
 as far as he was right after 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.849
 of the expulsion of the boy's event 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.620
 Monday in general after the expulsion 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.629
 of mendoza is unfortunately generated by 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.610
 the technical command entry is generated 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.610
 and everything is decided everything 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.439
 this 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.659
 it seems to me that the expelled something to the 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:25.400
 author of the goal we do not really know what 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.250
 is what happened there after the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.500
 aggressions that are given the gains 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.330
 skirmishes came back to enter this year in 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.939
 figueroa that supposed no longer had to 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.729
 being on the bench you will not like it 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.699
 the in the dressing room and is been 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.569
 finished and I'll see if the game happened 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.569
 by the end of the game 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.919
 I canceled the match and I think 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.400
 the referee is not going to continue retires 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.900
 heading to changing rooms 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.599
 seemingly apparently understand by 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.259
 lack of for lack of security by 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.259
 lack of guarantee 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.400
 how bad was I was politically 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.150
 the match was ending well 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.189
 football because huancayo with 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.689
 all the deficiencies that could have 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.449
 had in this encounter I was 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:19.439
 trying in one way or another to encourage 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.930
 the entity intigas staff was trying 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:25.439
 also arrive with the spaces that 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.240
 they were giving but they continue but those 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.379
 nonsense to see but but they are not 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.020
 players Juan Carlos there is a game 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.310
 crossed many people inside the so 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.310
 I do not understand what they do
