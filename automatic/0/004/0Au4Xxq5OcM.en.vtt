the lack of any stories about what life

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.180 
the lack of any stories about what life
was<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.820> Judean<00:00:42.600> were<00:00:43.440> exiled<00:00:43.980> in

Babylon biblical scholars agree that
this<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> exile<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> most

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this time of exile was one of the most

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
this time of exile was one of the most
critical<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> formation<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> Bible

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.930 
you look at biblical history it goes all
the<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.149> Exile<00:01:00.710> stops<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.070> then

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the way up to the Exile stops and then

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
the way up to the Exile stops and then
picks<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:03.840> after<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:05.010> Exile

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

picks up right after it the Exile
represents<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.479> black<00:01:06.780> hole<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.560> gap<00:01:07.860> in

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
represents this black hole this gap in

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.789 
represents this black hole this gap in
the<00:01:08.520> biblical<00:01:08.909> narrative<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.479> yet<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> think

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the biblical narrative and yet I think

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
the biblical narrative and yet I think
there<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.369> massive<00:01:11.970> parts<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> Bible

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there are massive parts of the Bible

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
there are massive parts of the Bible
including<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.680> particularly<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.790> Torah<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
Pentateuch that with which the Bible

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
Pentateuch that with which the Bible
starts<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.900> trying<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> talk

the dynamism about biblical scholarship

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.109 
the dynamism about biblical scholarship
is<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.680> allows<00:01:47.399> scholars<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
is the way it really allows scholars to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
is the way it really allows scholars to
read<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.350> an<00:01:49.470> ancient<00:01:49.920> texts<00:01:50.340> in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
read what is really an ancient texts in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
read what is really an ancient texts in
ever<00:01:50.759> new<00:01:51.030> ways<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:52.020> one<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
ever new ways I think one of the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.039 
ever new ways I think one of the
challenges<00:01:52.640> as<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.939> move<00:01:54.119> forward<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.659> as

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
challenges as we move forward and as

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
challenges as we move forward and as
biblical<00:01:55.259> studies<00:01:55.799> becomes<00:01:56.130> ever<00:01:56.399> more
