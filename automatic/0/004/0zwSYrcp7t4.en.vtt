can tell if a screen is too big for you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.070 
can tell if a screen is too big for you
or<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:26.340> opinions<00:00:26.970> grease<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
or not in my opinions grease that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
or not in my opinions grease that
screen<00:00:28.590> size<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.980> obviously<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.490> complete

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
screen size is obviously a complete

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
screen size is obviously a complete
matter<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.480> opinion<00:00:30.869> whether<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.199> like

bigger<00:00:31.679> screens<00:00:32.130> smaller<00:00:32.399> screens<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.809> all

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
bigger screens smaller screens it is all

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.729 
bigger screens smaller screens it is all
completely<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.030> feel<00:00:36.149> like

completely up to you and I feel like
obviously<00:00:37.739> bigger<00:00:38.129> screens<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> was

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
obviously bigger screens are it was

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
obviously bigger screens are it was
easier<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.350> fit<00:00:40.530> more<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
easier to see you can fit more on the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.180 
easier to see you can fit more on the
screen<00:00:41.660> but<00:00:42.660> also<00:00:42.930> smaller<00:00:43.469> screens<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.070> add

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
screen but also smaller screens can add

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
screen but also smaller screens can add
more<00:00:44.340> detail<00:00:44.820> depending<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:45.989> resolution

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
more detail depending on your resolution

more detail depending on your resolution
as<00:00:46.800> well<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.399> add<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.800> ease<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.039> use

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
as well as add more ease of use

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.660 
as well as add more ease of use
depending<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> main<00:00:52.920> factor<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
depending on the main factor which is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
depending on the main factor which is
the<00:00:53.699> size<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.329> hand<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:55.289> my<00:00:55.500> opinion<00:00:55.949> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the size of your hand in my opinion I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
the size of your hand in my opinion I
feel<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.480> could<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
feel like there could be there can be a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
feel like there could be there can be a
good<00:00:58.530> test<00:00:58.770> using<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.699> hand<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.270> it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
good test using your hand just it's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
good test using your hand just it's
obviously<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.410> an<00:01:01.530> exact<00:01:01.859> science<00:01:01.890> test<00:01:02.640> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
obviously not an exact science test is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.140 
obviously not an exact science test is
just<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> quick<00:01:03.329> test<00:01:03.830> telling<00:01:04.880> whether<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.060> not

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
just a quick test telling whether or not

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
just a quick test telling whether or not
a<00:01:06.210> phone<00:01:06.510> screen<00:01:06.869> size<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.409> too<00:01:07.710> large<00:01:08.040> for

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a phone screen size is too large for

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.420 
a phone screen size is too large for
your<00:01:08.640> hand<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.320> obviously<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
your hand or not so obviously I have

and Epic Touch 4G so I'm just going to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.620 
and Epic Touch 4G so I'm just going to
give<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> quick<00:01:20.759> overview<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> reason<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
give it a quick overview the reason I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.800 
give it a quick overview the reason I
have<00:01:21.869> these<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.700> 3.6<00:01:24.390> inches

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
have these is because this is 3.6 inches

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.560 
have these is because this is 3.6 inches
these<00:01:25.229> two<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.560> 4.0<00:01:26.159> inches<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> 4.3<00:01:27.299> inches

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
these two are 4.0 inches to 4.3 inches

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.289 
these two are 4.0 inches to 4.3 inches
4.5<00:01:28.530> inches<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.759> different<00:01:29.970> screen

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
4.5 inches so just different screen

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.410 
4.5 inches so just different screen
sizes<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.439> these<00:01:31.680> two<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.880> epic<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
sizes and I have these two the epic and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
sizes and I have these two the epic and
the<00:01:33.450> Nexus<00:01:33.780> S<00:01:33.900> 4G<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> same

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the Nexus S 4G which have the same

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
the Nexus S 4G which have the same
screen<00:01:35.579> size<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.060> they're<00:01:36.210> different<00:01:36.450> build

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
screen size but they're different build

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.289 
screen size but they're different build
so<00:01:37.590> build<00:01:37.890> matters<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.460> well<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> comes

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
so build matters as well when it comes

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.370 
so build matters as well when it comes
to<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:40.640> choosing<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.850> screen<00:01:42.150> size<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
main test that I like to do when

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
main test that I like to do when
choosing<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.110> phone<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> screen<00:01:47.159> size<00:01:47.460> is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
obviously things come into play such as

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.830 
obviously things come into play such as
having<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.320> keyboard<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.180> thickness<00:02:33.180> as<00:02:33.450> well

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
having a keyboard and thickness as well

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.200 
having a keyboard and thickness as well
as<00:02:34.200> obviously<00:02:34.770> where<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.280> screen<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.970> placed

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
as obviously where the screen is placed

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.750 
as obviously where the screen is placed
with<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.260> build<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.830> phone<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.610> all

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
with the build on the phone so it all

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.040 
with the build on the phone so it all
depends<00:02:39.240> on<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.390> bunch<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.690> different<00:02:39.930> factors

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
depends on a bunch of different factors

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.600 
depends on a bunch of different factors
that's<00:02:40.440> why<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.310> test

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
that's why I like to have this test

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.420 
that's why I like to have this test
because<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.950> basically<00:02:43.950> test<00:02:44.250> these

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
because it can basically test these

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.700 
because it can basically test these
things<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.390> different<00:02:45.750> factors<00:02:45.960> so

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
things with the different factors so

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.200 
things with the different factors so
that's<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.190> quick<00:02:47.400> test<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> go

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
that's just a quick test I'm going to go

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.490 
that's just a quick test I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.420> show<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.720> difference<00:02:49.170> I'm

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
ahead and show you a difference I'm

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900

with<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.160> other<00:03:35.280> hand<00:03:35.520> anything<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.180> that

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
with the other hand anything like that

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.380 
with the other hand anything like that
I'm<00:03:37.230> gonna<00:03:37.350> go<00:03:37.440> ahead<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.590> grab<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.209> epic<00:03:39.209> as

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
I'm gonna go ahead and grab the epic as

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.080 
I'm gonna go ahead and grab the epic as
you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.630> see<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.290> set<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.920> down<00:03:41.090> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
you can see if I do set it down the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.570 
you can see if I do set it down the
screen<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.050> Nexus<00:03:43.440> S<00:03:43.560> 4G<00:03:43.830> screen<00:03:44.370> actually

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
screen the Nexus S 4G screen actually

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.610 
screen the Nexus S 4G screen actually
sits<00:03:44.910> lower<00:03:45.180> than<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.570> epic<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.260> can<00:03:46.470> be

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
sits lower than the epic so it can be

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.140 
sits lower than the epic so it can be
different<00:03:46.830> depending<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.489> how<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.700> hold<00:03:47.910> it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
different depending on how you hold it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.470 
different depending on how you hold it
so<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:49.410> epics<00:03:49.800> upper<00:03:50.610> left-hand<00:03:50.880> corner<00:03:51.030> can

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
so the epics upper left-hand corner can

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.210 
so the epics upper left-hand corner can
be<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> little<00:03:51.989> bit<00:03:52.170> more<00:03:52.290> difficult<00:03:52.739> obviously

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
be a little bit more difficult obviously

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.220 
be a little bit more difficult obviously
it's<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> little<00:03:53.580> thicker<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.810> screens<00:03:55.140> a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
it's a little thicker and the screens a

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.420 
it's a little thicker and the screens a
little<00:03:55.410> higher<00:03:55.560> up<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.160> be<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> little

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
little higher up so it can be a little

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.830 
little higher up so it can be a little
more<00:03:56.580> difficult<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.030> reach<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:57.600> still

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
more difficult to reach I can still

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.540 
more difficult to reach I can still
reach<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.170> obviously<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:59.070> that's<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
reach it obviously but that's just a

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.280 
reach it obviously but that's just a
factor<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> look<00:04:00.269> at<00:04:00.420> with<00:04:00.570> thickness<00:04:00.870> and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
factor to look at with thickness and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.310 
factor to look at with thickness and
showing<00:04:02.010> how<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.310> screen<00:04:02.670> size<00:04:03.260> isn't<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
showing how the screen size isn't the

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.440 
showing how the screen size isn't the
only<00:04:04.470> factor<00:04:04.739> with<00:04:05.190> reaching<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.970> corner

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
only factor with reaching that corner

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.210 
only factor with reaching that corner
I'm<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.080> grab<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.350> photon<00:04:07.860> really

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
I'm going to grab the photon really

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.790 
I'm going to grab the photon really
quick<00:04:08.780> 4.3<00:04:09.780> inches<00:04:10.170> I'm<00:04:10.440> going<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:10.739> ahead

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
quick 4.3 inches I'm going to go ahead

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.410 
quick 4.3 inches I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:10.980> run<00:04:11.100> through<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.310> test<00:04:11.580> as<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:11.940> can<00:04:12.150> see

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
and run through the test as you can see

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.870 
and run through the test as you can see
I<00:04:12.450> don't<00:04:13.440> think<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.860> can<00:04:14.040> really<00:04:14.310> reach<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
I don't think I can really reach the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.580 
I don't think I can really reach the
upper<00:04:15.180> left<00:04:15.450> corner<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.019> true<00:04:16.290> upper

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
upper left corner the true upper

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.310 
upper left corner the true upper
left-hand<00:04:16.830> corner<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.280> get<00:04:17.489> very<00:04:17.790> close

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
left-hand corner I can get very close

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.170 
left-hand corner I can get very close
without<00:04:19.320> adjusting<00:04:20.040> my<00:04:20.190> hand<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:20.790> if<00:04:21.030> I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
without adjusting my hand but if I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.480 
without adjusting my hand but if I
stretch<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.780> really<00:04:22.049> far<00:04:22.289> I<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.650> reach<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.039> but

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
stretch it really far I can reach it but

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.060 
stretch it really far I can reach it but
I<00:04:23.729> think<00:04:24.030> that's<00:04:24.240> about<00:04:24.390> my<00:04:24.720> limit<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.140> photons

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
I think that's about my limit is photons

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.260 
I think that's about my limit is photons
build<00:04:26.490> size<00:04:26.820> it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
build size it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.029 
build size it
somewhat<00:04:27.840> thick<00:04:28.080> but<00:04:28.259> it<00:04:28.349> is<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> sturdy<00:04:28.830> device

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
somewhat thick but it is a sturdy device

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.420 
somewhat thick but it is a sturdy device
as<00:04:29.370> well<00:04:30.120> as<00:04:30.650> just<00:04:31.650> reaching<00:04:32.039> that<00:04:32.160> upper

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
as well as just reaching that upper

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.700 
as well as just reaching that upper
left-hand<00:04:33.060> corner<00:04:33.360> or<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:34.199> you<00:04:34.319> hold<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.620> with

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
left-hand corner or if you hold it with

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.020 
left-hand corner or if you hold it with
your<00:04:34.740> left<00:04:34.919> hand<00:04:35.039> if<00:04:35.190> you're<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> lefty<00:04:35.669> trying

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
your left hand if you're a lefty trying

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.980 
your left hand if you're a lefty trying
to<00:04:36.090> reach<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> upper<00:04:36.389> right-hand<00:04:36.690> corner

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
to reach the upper right-hand corner

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.320 
to reach the upper right-hand corner
obviously<00:04:37.590> flip<00:04:37.860> flop<00:04:38.069> but<00:04:38.610> now<00:04:38.909> I'm<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.240> to

obviously flip flop but now I'm going to

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.999 
obviously flip flop but now I'm going to
grab<00:04:39.479> go<00:04:39.840> ahead<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.080> grab<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.349> Samsung<00:04:40.860> Epic

doing this test I'm going to go ahead

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.529 
doing this test I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:50.280> hold<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.699> make<00:04:50.940> sure<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.210> hold<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.509> like

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
and hold it make sure you hold it like

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.270 
and hold it make sure you hold it like
you<00:04:51.659> always<00:04:51.780> do<00:04:52.289> normally<00:04:52.830> do<00:04:52.949> with<00:04:53.069> one<00:04:53.250> hand

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
you always do normally do with one hand

you always do normally do with one hand
and<00:04:53.699> try<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.449> touch<00:04:54.569> the<00:04:54.720> corners<00:04:55.250> as<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.340> can

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
and try and touch the corners as you can

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.100 
and try and touch the corners as you can
see<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.729> upper<00:04:56.970> left-hand<00:04:57.270> corner<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.780> can

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
see the upper left-hand corner I can

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.159 
see the upper left-hand corner I can
still<00:04:58.440> only<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.659> don't<00:05:00.659> think<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:00.870> can<00:05:00.930> reach<00:05:01.139> it

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
still only I don't think I can reach it

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.110 
still only I don't think I can reach it
I<00:05:01.349> can't<00:05:01.650> reach<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.009> corner<00:05:02.310> I'm<00:05:02.490> just<00:05:02.909> short

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
I can't reach the corner I'm just short

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.149 
I can't reach the corner I'm just short
of<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.449> but<00:05:04.020> without<00:05:04.259> adjusting<00:05:04.889> my<00:05:04.979> hand

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
of it but without adjusting my hand

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.909 
of it but without adjusting my hand
obviously<00:05:05.340> but<00:05:05.789> I'm<00:05:05.880> just<00:05:06.150> short<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.509> it<00:05:06.659> so<00:05:06.990> in

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
obviously but I'm just short of it so in

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.460 
obviously but I'm just short of it so in
my<00:05:08.099> opinion<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.550> might<00:05:09.419> be<00:05:09.630> out<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.840> my<00:05:10.139> limit

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
my opinion this might be out of my limit

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.649 
my opinion this might be out of my limit
when<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.340> comes<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.789> trying<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.240> reach<00:05:12.419> things

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
when it comes to trying to reach things

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.600 
when it comes to trying to reach things
in<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.930> upper<00:05:13.110> left<00:05:13.289> hand<00:05:13.409> corner<00:05:13.560> that's<00:05:14.310> my

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
in the upper left hand corner that's my

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.460 
in the upper left hand corner that's my
opinion<00:05:15.090> on<00:05:15.240> screen<00:05:15.599> size<00:05:15.780> granted<00:05:16.259> I<00:05:16.409> do

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
opinion on screen size granted I do

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.159 
opinion on screen size granted I do
really<00:05:16.949> like<00:05:17.250> bigger<00:05:17.610> screens<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:18.870> when<00:05:19.080> it

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
really like bigger screens but when it

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.080 
really like bigger screens but when it
comes<00:05:19.380> down<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.009> I<00:05:20.159> would<00:05:20.400> say<00:05:20.580> cell<00:05:20.880> phones

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
comes down to it I would say cell phones

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.600 
comes down to it I would say cell phones
functionality<00:05:21.900> comes<00:05:22.380> down<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.830> making<00:05:23.550> sure

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
functionality comes down to making sure

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.999 
functionality comes down to making sure
you<00:05:23.880> can<00:05:24.060> reach<00:05:24.300> all<00:05:24.569> parts<00:05:25.409> of<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.650> screen

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
you can reach all parts of the screen

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.270 
you can reach all parts of the screen
while<00:05:26.669> holding<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.300> in<00:05:27.449> one<00:05:27.690> hand<00:05:28.080> like<00:05:28.800> normal

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
while holding it in one hand like normal

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.399 
while holding it in one hand like normal
so<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.210> completely<00:05:30.900> my<00:05:31.020> opinion

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
so that is completely my opinion

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:32.600 
so that is completely my opinion
obviously<00:05:31.530> this<00:05:31.860> test<00:05:32.130> isn't<00:05:32.310> anything

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
obviously this test isn't anything

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.610 
obviously this test isn't anything
scientific<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.960> kind<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.199> wanting<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.469> give

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
scientific just kind of wanting to give

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.529 
scientific just kind of wanting to give
you<00:05:34.770> all<00:05:34.979> my<00:05:35.250> opinion<00:05:35.849> and<00:05:36.090> just<00:05:36.330> show<00:05:36.509> you

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
you all my opinion and just show you

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.390 
you all my opinion and just show you
guys<00:05:36.719> what<00:05:37.199> I<00:05:37.229> run<00:05:37.560> through<00:05:37.770> when<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:37.919> do<00:05:38.039> this

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
guys what I run through when I do this

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.790 
guys what I run through when I do this
test<00:05:38.759> obviously<00:05:39.599> it<00:05:39.930> varies<00:05:40.199> on<00:05:40.319> hand<00:05:40.590> size

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
test obviously it varies on hand size

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.219 
test obviously it varies on hand size
women<00:05:41.219> hands<00:05:41.550> are<00:05:41.750> generally<00:05:42.750> smaller<00:05:43.110> than

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
women hands are generally smaller than

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.339 
women hands are generally smaller than
men's<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.979> as<00:05:44.669> well<00:05:44.969> as<00:05:45.240> just<00:05:45.719> everyone's

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
men's and as well as just everyone's

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.379 
men's and as well as just everyone's
hand<00:05:46.590> comes<00:05:46.889> in<00:05:47.039> different<00:05:47.310> size<00:05:47.819> shapes<00:05:48.180> and

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
hand comes in different size shapes and

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.360 
hand comes in different size shapes and
sizes<00:05:48.569> so<00:05:48.930> it's<00:05:49.710> obviously<00:05:50.130> going<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.310> vary

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
sizes so it's obviously going to vary

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.670 
sizes so it's obviously going to vary
this<00:05:50.699> test<00:05:50.940> is<00:05:51.090> going<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.270> vary<00:05:51.509> based<00:05:52.380> on<00:05:52.620> your

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
this test is going to vary based on your

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.370 
this test is going to vary based on your
hand<00:05:52.949> size<00:05:53.159> so<00:05:53.520> that<00:05:53.909> is<00:05:54.150> in<00:05:54.419> my<00:05:54.719> opinion<00:05:54.960> the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
hand size so that is in my opinion the

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.170 
hand size so that is in my opinion the
factor<00:05:56.279> to<00:05:56.400> choosing<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.759> bigger<00:05:56.940> screen

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
factor to choosing a bigger screen

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.870 
factor to choosing a bigger screen
that's<00:05:57.389> why<00:05:57.539> I'm<00:05:57.659> a<00:05:57.719> little<00:05:58.699> interested<00:05:59.699> to

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
that's why I'm a little interested to

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.420 
that's why I'm a little interested to
see<00:06:00.210> how<00:06:00.509> the<00:06:00.680> Galaxy<00:06:01.680> Nexus<00:06:01.830> is<00:06:02.219> going<00:06:02.370> to

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
see how the Galaxy Nexus is going to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.279 
see how the Galaxy Nexus is going to
look<00:06:02.580> with<00:06:02.759> four<00:06:03.240> point<00:06:03.509> six<00:06:03.810> five<00:06:03.990> inch

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
look with four point six five inch

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.890 
look with four point six five inch
screen<00:06:04.620> I<00:06:04.650> believe<00:06:05.180> depending<00:06:06.180> on<00:06:06.300> its<00:06:06.569> build

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
screen I believe depending on its build

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.709 
screen I believe depending on its build
and<00:06:07.289> as<00:06:07.650> well<00:06:08.039> as<00:06:08.279> having<00:06:08.940> such<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.270> big<00:06:09.479> screen

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
and as well as having such a big screen

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.209 
and as well as having such a big screen
I'm<00:06:09.960> not<00:06:10.110> sure<00:06:10.289> how<00:06:10.500> well<00:06:10.710> that's<00:06:10.830> going<00:06:11.039> to<00:06:11.130> go

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
I'm not sure how well that's going to go

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.459 
I'm not sure how well that's going to go
over<00:06:11.490> with<00:06:11.610> everyone<00:06:12.060> depending<00:06:12.870> on<00:06:13.169> their

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
over with everyone depending on their

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.200 
over with everyone depending on their
hand<00:06:13.680> size<00:06:13.919> I<00:06:14.159> think<00:06:14.400> obviously<00:06:15.060> you<00:06:15.150> guys

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
hand size I think obviously you guys

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.510 
hand size I think obviously you guys
with<00:06:15.449> bigger<00:06:15.599> hands<00:06:15.930> will<00:06:16.620> generally<00:06:17.310> or

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
with bigger hands will generally or

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.159 
with bigger hands will generally or
girls<00:06:17.849> with<00:06:18.060> bigger<00:06:18.210> hands<00:06:18.419> will<00:06:18.569> generally

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
girls with bigger hands will generally

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.519 
girls with bigger hands will generally
have<00:06:19.440> maybe<00:06:20.400> bigger<00:06:20.969> pants<00:06:21.900> bigger<00:06:22.110> pants

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:22.529 
have maybe bigger pants bigger pants

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.860 
have maybe bigger pants bigger pants
pockets<00:06:23.009> which<00:06:23.250> will<00:06:23.490> allow<00:06:23.849> them<00:06:24.090> to<00:06:24.150> fit<00:06:24.719> the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
pockets which will allow them to fit the

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.439 
pockets which will allow them to fit the
bigger<00:06:25.050> phone<00:06:25.289> into<00:06:26.279> their<00:06:26.490> pockets<00:06:27.150> this<00:06:27.270> is

bigger phone into their pockets this is

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.180 
bigger phone into their pockets this is
obviously<00:06:27.870> just<00:06:27.930> a<00:06:28.169> generalization<00:06:28.830> not

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
obviously just a generalization not
