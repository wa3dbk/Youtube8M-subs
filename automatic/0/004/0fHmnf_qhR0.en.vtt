00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:15.580
 hi guys today let's see how 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:18.140
 replace the battery of an iphone 6 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.700
 this phone does not need the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.860
 battery satisfaction however seen 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.380
 what I must already open I will show you 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.700
 how to do that probably the future 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.310
 it will be something that will come in handy first 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.020
 of everything with a torx key to remove 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.170
 the screws you find that are housed in 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:46.070
 next to the charging socket 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:50.140
 ok with a pick or a kit that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:56.380
 we will see soon to pass with 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.380
 delicacy on the edges in this way 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:09.399
 way will allow me to open the iphone 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:24.890
 ok at this point in the device you can 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:29.380
 open to change the battery 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.380
 just remove one 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:44.490
 two screws remove the protection e 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.860
 lift this connector are 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.909
 get this connector warm up at 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.630
 battery with a high sesame a team 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.830
 pass under the battery to disconnect 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 the glue 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.800
 I recommend you be careful when 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.369
 come to this point because they are there 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.789
 also the connector of the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.220
 ok keys that's it 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.220
 simple but useful hello guys
