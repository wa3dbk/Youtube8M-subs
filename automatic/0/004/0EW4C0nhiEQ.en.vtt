00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
out and I think I'm going to end up

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.189 
out and I think I'm going to end up
actually<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.099> see<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.840> way<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> looks

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
actually you can see the way it looks

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.479 
actually you can see the way it looks
over<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:32.000> with<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.180> groove<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
over here with this groove and this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
over here with this groove and this
one's<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.969> pushed<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.960> got<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.260> figure

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
one's all pushed up so we got to figure

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
one's all pushed up so we got to figure
out<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> got<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.270> pull<00:00:39.480> everything

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
out what we got to do to pull everything

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
out what we got to do to pull everything
kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> back<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.770> shape<00:00:40.980> make<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
kind of back into shape make it so the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.350 
kind of back into shape make it so the
headlight<00:00:42.390> will<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.850> never<00:00:44.850> taken

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
headlight will go back down never taken

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
headlight will go back down never taken
one<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> these<00:00:45.660> apart<00:00:45.719> before<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
one of these apart before so this is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
one of these apart before so this is
kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> learning

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
kind of going to be a learning

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.389 
kind of going to be a learning
experience<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:49.260> me<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:49.590> I've<00:00:49.980> taken<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
experience for me I think I've taken a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.990 
experience for me I think I've taken a
look<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
look at it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.840 
look at it
I<00:00:51.440> think<00:00:53.120> first<00:00:54.120> thing<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.449> need<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.850> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I think first thing I need to do is that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
I think first thing I need to do is that
take<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.239> plastic<00:00:57.809> piece<00:00:58.020> off<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.500> here

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
take this plastic piece off right here

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
take this plastic piece off right here
across<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> front<00:00:59.699> because<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> pull

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
across the front because I got to pull

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.039 
across the front because I got to pull
these<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.070> tabs<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> headlight

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
these little tabs to get the headlight

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.740 
these little tabs to get the headlight
off<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.640> then<00:01:05.640> we'll<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.510> there

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
off and then we'll kind of go from there

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.820 
off and then we'll kind of go from there
and<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.610> looks<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.210> side<00:01:09.830> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and look see looks like on this side the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
and look see looks like on this side the
bumpers<00:01:11.189> come<00:01:11.430> detached<00:01:11.880> from<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> fender<00:01:12.689> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
bumpers come detached from the fender so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
bumpers come detached from the fender so
we'll<00:01:13.409> try<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.890> reattach<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:17.850> try

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.990 
dipping down and it's supposed to allow
for<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.750> headlight<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> sit<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> there

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
for that headlight to sit in there

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.649 
for that headlight to sit in there
you'll<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.439> part<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
you'll also see that this part of the

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.550 
you'll also see that this part of the
bumper<00:02:06.659> support<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:08.009> pushed<00:02:08.580> up<00:02:09.289> whereas<00:02:10.289> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
bumper support is pushed up whereas this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.110 
bumper support is pushed up whereas this
one<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.069> all<00:02:11.459> nice<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.819> flat<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.780> I'm<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
one is all nice and flat so I'm going to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.000 
one is all nice and flat so I'm going to
try<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.390> Bend<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.870> back<00:02:13.930> into<00:02:14.500> shape<00:02:14.739> we're

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
try and Bend that back into shape we're

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.309 
try and Bend that back into shape we're
just<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.400> try<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.730> mimic<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.989> shape<00:02:17.290> of

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
just going to try and mimic the shape of

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.490 
just going to try and mimic the shape of
of<00:02:18.250> everything<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.090> area<00:02:19.510> on<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:20.470> other

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
of everything in this area on the other

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.770 
of everything in this area on the other
side<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.680> one<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.549> headlight<00:02:25.330> support

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
side and this one this headlight support

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.860 
side and this one this headlight support
bracket<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.500> see<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.010> straight<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.690> this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
bracket you can see is straight and this

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.899 
bracket you can see is straight and this
one's<00:02:29.140> kind<00:02:29.409> of<00:02:29.560> mangled<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.760> other

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
one's kind of mangled up and the other

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.460 
one's kind of mangled up and the other
thing<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.299> noticing<00:02:31.629> here<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.290> this

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
thing I'm noticing here is that this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.100 
thing I'm noticing here is that this
fender<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.670> actually<00:02:34.150> tipped<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.599> way<00:02:34.930> it's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
fender is actually tipped that way it's

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.360 
fender is actually tipped that way it's
like<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.379> pushed<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:36.090> everything<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.329> so

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
like it pushed the everything like so

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.729 
like it pushed the everything like so
whereas<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.900> all<00:02:41.019> straight<00:02:41.409> up<00:02:41.590> and

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
whereas this one is all straight up and

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.170 
whereas this one is all straight up and
down<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:44.860> I've<00:02:44.980> done<00:02:45.129> so<00:02:45.370> far<00:02:45.609> is<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.910> got<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
down what I've done so far is I got to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
down what I've done so far is I got to
pushing<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.109> bumper<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:48.700> piece

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
pushing down on this bumper and a piece

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.140 
pushing down on this bumper and a piece
of<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.239> bumper<00:02:49.690> pad<00:02:49.930> come<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:51.030> what<00:02:52.030> these

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
of this bumper pad come out what these

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.809 
of this bumper pad come out what these
bumper<00:02:52.660> pads<00:02:52.840> are<00:02:53.140> designed<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.620> do<00:02:53.819> aside

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
bumper pads are designed to do aside

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.539 
bumper pads are designed to do aside
from<00:02:54.849> just<00:02:55.209> support<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> bumper<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.549> to

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
from just support the bumper is to

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.210 
from just support the bumper is to
absorb<00:02:57.879> an<00:02:58.000> impact<00:02:58.390> from<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.530> front<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.099> know

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
absorb an impact from the front you know

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.360 
absorb an impact from the front you know
so<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.659> they're<00:03:01.870> real<00:03:02.500> dense<00:03:02.859> foam

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
so that and they're real dense foam

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.550 
so that and they're real dense foam
stuff<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.420> when<00:03:04.659> you<00:03:04.780> hit<00:03:04.930> Suppan<00:03:05.349> it'll

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
stuff so when you hit Suppan it'll

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.520 
stuff so when you hit Suppan it'll
squeeze<00:03:06.250> together<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.940> crush<00:03:07.379> what<00:03:08.379> it's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
squeeze together and crush what it's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.309 
squeeze together and crush what it's
done<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:08.950> its<00:03:09.159> crushed<00:03:09.609> and<00:03:09.970> broken<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.840> so

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
done is its crushed and broken and so

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.720 
done is its crushed and broken and so
when<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.500> start<00:03:11.799> pushing<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.700> whole

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
when I start pushing on that the whole

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.509 
when I start pushing on that the whole
thing<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.420> kind<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.690> kind<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.319> put<00:03:14.769> and

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
thing just kind of kind of put and

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.339 
thing just kind of kind of put and
dropped<00:03:15.819> out<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.209> there<00:03:16.359> so<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> think<00:03:17.200> we'll

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
dropped out of there so I think we'll

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.819 
dropped out of there so I think we'll
just<00:03:17.560> leave<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:18.099> piece<00:03:18.400> out<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.739> kind<00:03:20.739> of

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
just leave this piece out and kind of

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.970 
just leave this piece out and kind of
try<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.280> get<00:03:21.459> things<00:03:22.500> straightened<00:03:23.500> up<00:03:23.739> maybe

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
try and get things straightened up maybe

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.530 
try and get things straightened up maybe
with<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.190> little<00:03:24.400> bit<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.549> heat<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> bumper

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
with a little bit of heat on the bumper

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.659 
with a little bit of heat on the bumper
here<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.530> gonna<00:03:26.650> need<00:03:26.889> a<00:03:26.919> new<00:03:27.099> bumper<00:03:27.459> shell

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
here it's gonna need a new bumper shell

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.379 
here it's gonna need a new bumper shell
anyways<00:03:29.310> it'll<00:03:30.310> straighten<00:03:30.579> up<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.329> I'm

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
anyways it'll straighten up that and I'm

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.879 
anyways it'll straighten up that and I'm
gonna<00:03:31.510> try<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.870> push<00:03:32.079> on<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.440> fender<00:03:32.859> a

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
gonna try and push on this fender a

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.710 
gonna try and push on this fender a
little<00:03:33.129> bit<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.579> get<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.060> straightened<00:03:34.510> up

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
little bit and get it straightened up

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.250 
little bit and get it straightened up
then<00:03:35.650> we'll<00:03:36.040> back<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.000> car<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.269> shut<00:03:38.139> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
then we'll back the car out shut the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.159 
then we'll back the car out shut the
lights<00:03:38.440> off<00:03:38.590> pointed<00:03:39.220> at<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.519> door<00:03:39.930> back<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
lights off pointed at that door back the

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.960 
lights off pointed at that door back the
car<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.620> as<00:03:41.769> far<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:42.220> we<00:03:42.400> can<00:03:42.639> and<00:03:42.849> basically

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
car in as far as we can and basically

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.449 
car in as far as we can and basically
what<00:03:43.419> we<00:03:43.540> want<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.840> do<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.949> we'll<00:03:45.129> put<00:03:45.310> that

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
what we want to do is we'll put that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.009 
what we want to do is we'll put that
headlight<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.239> we'll<00:03:46.329> just<00:03:46.359> kind<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.780> line

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
headlight in and we'll just kind of line

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.800 
headlight in and we'll just kind of line
up<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.379> beam<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:48.069> headlight<00:03:48.549> with<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
up the beam on this headlight with the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.140 
up the beam on this headlight with the
beam<00:03:49.989> on<00:03:50.169> that<00:03:50.349> headlight<00:03:50.859> there's<00:03:51.160> actually

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
beam on that headlight there's actually

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.849 
beam on that headlight there's actually
a<00:03:52.180> formula<00:03:52.629> for<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:53.319> I<00:03:53.349> think<00:03:53.560> it's<00:03:53.680> like

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
a formula for that and I think it's like

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.180 
a formula for that and I think it's like
20<00:03:54.340> feet<00:03:54.549> away<00:03:54.579> you're<00:03:55.299> supposed<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:56.190> so

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
20 feet away you're supposed to be so
