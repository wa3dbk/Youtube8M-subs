00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.120
 Hi, as I told you, my channel would be 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.960
 of varied topics because in this I include 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.390
 an old game that was the one they play 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.580
 our dads in those times which 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.710
 it's called emerald pokemon that 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.710
 originally it is from the visual console 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.539
 I go to the sea but with the inhabitant you can 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.750
 download in any kind of person 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.239
 web then in this video what I want 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.480
 show I have already spent all this game 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.190
 mate to maximum all those things but there 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870
 something that I think I've never seen that 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.829
 nobody has posted before since it 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.540
 like and it is that it turns out that you can 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.850
 capture the mont himself is 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.910
 legendary so far those that I've 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.610
 managed to see have been my your new celebi 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.480
 pitch and I 've done it without any kind of 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 gamesa 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.920
 to prove it and try it in 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.570
 their houses if they want to apply the same 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.640
 to see if you also work for them 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.800
 it is simply a mystery that that 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.940
 day I saw I stayed like that wow this 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.090
 I had never seen it before then 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.420
 here as you will see first they have to 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.689
 get to the village for such 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.939
 from which they descend by that bridge he quoted and if 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.939
 in this sequence we go here 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.880
 we had our stairs 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:36.039
 we go through the doors other stairs 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 we download these and enter this test 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.990
 which is called the middle waterfall 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.759
 good in this waterfall 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.939
 leave where we do a certain journey to 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.770
 get to where the maximum they remember the 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.750
 typical that we have to take the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.420
 letter in the city contributed to the beginning 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.700
 if it is the same maximum 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.860
 then a being where you fight with him 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.100
 for some strange reason that I do not know 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.850
 out in level 70 legendary pokémon 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.850
 attacking 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.450
 I do not have to show life I do not know why 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.270
 what went well 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.270
 on the tripod we give the case 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.090
 then had a bit of being a pastor and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.290
 breed 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.480
 they go up 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.480
 enter this part of the cave 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.000
 they enter this staircase 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.849
 and how can you see friends 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.630
 this is the part where this maxim but 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.920
 look agreal in pokémons 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.099
 what 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.650
 that is, in a way they simply come out 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.650
 here I do not have any gas 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.500
 now this out against night 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.830
 but seen my heart of the amazons but 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:31.080
 this raised me new russia 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.080
 which keeps very amazed 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.880
 so I would like you to also 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:45.670
 try this to see if 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.770
 it also works and if so I think 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.570
 that I am the first to publish this topic 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.190
 since I 've always done that you can 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.190
 get only with gamesa 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.120
 that too 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.720
 I find it amazing because we have 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.069
 legendary that I bring come from nothing 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.920
 gets any kind of code or someone 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.630
 so 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 I hope you have served them well 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.650
 at least mami I do not know why I 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.920
 that comes out 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.950
 but look simply 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.700
 so share it with your friends if 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.430
 This experience also helped them as 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.160
 from the little brother above share it with 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.880
 friends and all those who love us 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.370
 take off without any desire 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.620
 because it has always been seen that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.100

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.030
