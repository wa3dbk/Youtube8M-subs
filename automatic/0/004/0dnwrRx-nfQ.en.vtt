what gonna do today is have a look at
the<00:00:11.370> whippin<00:00:11.910> song<00:00:12.180> graft<00:00:12.920> if<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.130> see

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the whippin song graft if you can see

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.060 
the whippin song graft if you can see
this<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:14.610> drawn<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:15.420> diagram<00:00:15.630> here

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.430 

the<00:00:20.070> whippin<00:00:20.340> tongue<00:00:20.580> graft<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:22.080> take<00:00:22.260> one

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
the whippin tongue graft I can take one

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.189 
the whippin tongue graft I can take one
or<00:00:22.470> two<00:00:22.590> forms<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.580> M<00:00:23.910> sign<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
or two forms if the M sign one of the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
or two forms if the M sign one of the
rootstock<00:00:25.440> are<00:00:25.650> about<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.070> same<00:00:26.279> length<00:00:26.340> then

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
rootstock are about the same length then

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
rootstock are about the same length then
you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.060> go<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.039> similar<00:00:29.039> setup<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.460> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you can go for the similar setup so on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.170 
you can go for the similar setup so on
the<00:00:29.760> left<00:00:30.060> following<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.030> sign<00:00:33.030> will

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the left following that if the sign will

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.869 
the left following that if the sign will
be<00:00:33.210> smaller<00:00:33.570> than<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.960> rootstock<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.729> go

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
be smaller than the rootstock you can go

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.579 
be smaller than the rootstock you can go
and<00:00:36.210> write<00:00:36.390> join<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.720> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> side<00:00:37.260> which<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
and write join it on the side which is

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.820 
and write join it on the side which is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
need a sharp knife in this case I use a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
need a sharp knife in this case I use a
Stanley<00:00:54.360> knife<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:56.269> ferociously<00:00:57.269> sharp<00:00:57.659> they

know it's sharp and then when the blunt
use<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> other<00:01:00.720> side<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.049> blade<00:01:01.260> when

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
use the other side of the blade when

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.789 
use the other side of the blade when
that's<00:01:02.400> gone<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.699> put<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.970> new<00:01:03.119> blade<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.799> we

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that's gone you put a new blade in it we

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.840 
that's gone you put a new blade in it we
need<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.100> tape<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> bind<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:07.189> graft<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
need some tape to bind up our graft this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.080 
need some tape to bind up our graft this
is<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.689> some<00:01:10.079> standard<00:01:11.039> tapes<00:01:11.399> not<00:01:11.549> parafilm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is just some standard tapes not parafilm

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
is just some standard tapes not parafilm
area<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.539> we'll<00:01:12.719> be<00:01:12.869> cutting<00:01:13.259> off<00:01:13.380> whether<00:01:14.009> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
area so we'll be cutting off whether you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
area so we'll be cutting off whether you
use<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> use<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.270> sort<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> tape<00:01:15.780> or

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
use that you use this sort of tape or

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.310 
use that you use this sort of tape or
slices<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:16.859> of<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> freezer<00:01:17.490> bag<00:01:18.109> that's<00:01:19.109> sort

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
slices out of a freezer bag that's sort

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.480 
slices out of a freezer bag that's sort
of<00:01:19.380> plastic<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.219> really<00:01:20.310> make<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
of plastic it doesn't really make a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.679 
of plastic it doesn't really make a
difference<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:21.060> tree<00:01:21.359> doesn't<00:01:21.570> know

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
difference the tree doesn't know

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
difference the tree doesn't know
anything<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.109> about<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> differences<00:01:23.399> so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
anything about about the differences so

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.819 
anything about about the differences so
it'll<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.539> fine<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.320> finally<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.799> need

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
it'll be fine and then finally we need

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.639 
it'll be fine and then finally we need
some<00:01:26.219> some<00:01:26.939> wax<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.780> wear<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.469> with

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
some some wax to wear see little with

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.429 
some some wax to wear see little with
this<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> much<00:01:30.810> I've<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.109> been

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
this is some so much I've just been

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.060 
this is some so much I've just been
heating<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.969> can<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.070> put

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
heating up in a can so that we can put

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
heating up in a can so that we can put
it<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.249> as<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:35.969> need<00:01:36.149> it<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.420> put<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.780> reheat

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it on as when we need it I put to reheat

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.779 
it on as when we need it I put to reheat
that<00:01:37.350> before<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.009> adds<00:01:38.189> using<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.609> you're

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
that before we get adds using it you're

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.550 
that before we get adds using it you're
the<00:01:38.939> most<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.719> important<00:01:40.109> thing<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.289> have

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the most really important thing to have

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.380 
the most really important thing to have
a<00:01:41.060> label<00:01:42.560> without<00:01:43.560> without<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.369> you'll<00:01:44.820> have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a label without without this you'll have

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.779 
a label without without this you'll have
some<00:01:45.600> real<00:01:45.869> problems<00:01:46.340> get<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.490> label

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
some real problems get your label

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.849 
some real problems get your label
written<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.179> before<00:01:48.749> you<00:01:48.929> do<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.319> graft<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
written out before you do your graft and

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.130 
written out before you do your graft and
then<00:01:50.009> you're<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.280> ready<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.609> go<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> graph

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
then you're all ready to go do the graph

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
then you're all ready to go do the graph
populate<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.859> put<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.759> side<00:01:53.819> and<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
populate on put it to one side and then

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
populate on put it to one side and then
there's<00:01:54.810> never<00:01:55.140> gonna<00:01:55.289> be<00:01:55.409> any<00:01:55.499> mistake<00:01:55.979> later

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
there's never gonna be any mistake later

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.809 
there's never gonna be any mistake later
on<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:57.420> let's<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.869> cracking<00:01:58.340> okay<00:01:59.340> right

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
to finish off grafting today um so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.020 
to finish off grafting today um so
there's<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.819> rootstock

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
there's the rootstock

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.360 
there's the rootstock
here's<00:02:16.780> Miss<00:02:16.990> Ironwood<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.160> I'm<00:02:18.250> going

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
here's Miss Ironwood so what I'm going

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.340 
here's Miss Ironwood so what I'm going
to<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> variety<00:02:21.430> called<00:02:22.350> Royal

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
to do this is a variety called Royal

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.950 
to do this is a variety called Royal
Jubilee<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.240> we<00:02:25.300> need<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.480> do<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.780> a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
Jubilee so what we need to do is a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.530 
Jubilee so what we need to do is a
sloping<00:02:26.920> court<00:02:28.440> across<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.590> sign<00:02:29.830> would<00:02:33.540> take

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
sloping court across the sign would take

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.850 
sloping court across the sign would take
off<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.810> end

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.620 

a<00:02:39.940> chorus<00:02:40.940> we<00:02:41.180> are<00:02:41.210> going<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.510> need<00:02:41.570> a

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
a chorus we are going to need a

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.350 
a chorus we are going to need a
corresponding<00:02:42.500> court<00:02:42.800> across<00:02:43.100> our<00:02:43.430> rootstock

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
corresponding court across our rootstock

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360 
corresponding court across our rootstock
so<00:02:45.140> we<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.500> hold<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.860> up<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.070> see<00:02:46.220> what

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so we can just hold it up to see what

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.780 
so we can just hold it up to see what
sort<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.670> length<00:02:46.850> we<00:02:47.030> need<00:02:47.380> okay<00:02:48.580> let's<00:02:49.580> give

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
sort of length we need okay let's give

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.990 
sort of length we need okay let's give
that<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> go<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.660> shake<00:02:56.870> off<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:58.000> layer

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
that a go you just shake off that layer

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.360 
that a go you just shake off that layer
to<00:02:59.120> expose<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.070> come<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:05.800> yeah<00:03:06.830> that's<00:03:07.160> not

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
to expose that come in yeah that's not

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.130 
to expose that come in yeah that's not
that<00:03:07.520> what's<00:03:07.760> good<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.060> me<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.720> next<00:03:08.930> thing

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
that what's good to me so the next thing

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.320 
that what's good to me so the next thing
to<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.340> cut<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.760> tongues<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.300> a

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
to do is to cut the tongues this is a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.510 
to do is to cut the tongues this is a
bit<00:03:14.570> where<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.080> do<00:03:15.470> some<00:03:15.800> real<00:03:16.160> serious

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
bit where you can do some real serious

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.110 
bit where you can do some real serious
serious<00:03:17.420> damage<00:03:17.780> what<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.620> want<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.800> do<00:03:18.890> is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
serious damage what I want to do is

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.699 
serious damage what I want to do is
other<00:03:20.120> lengths<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.690> procore<00:03:21.080> third-down

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
other lengths you procore third-down

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.560 
other lengths you procore third-down
then<00:03:22.670> you're<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.910> cut<00:03:23.150> back<00:03:23.360> to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
then you're going to cut back to

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.500 
then you're going to cut back to
yourself<00:03:23.720> be<00:03:24.380> very<00:03:24.830> very<00:03:25.430> careful<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.239> you

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
yourself be very very careful you you

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.720 
yourself be very very careful you you
can<00:03:26.660> easily<00:03:26.959> cut<00:03:27.410> yourself<00:03:27.739> if<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.310> interlock

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
can easily cut yourself if you interlock

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.670 
can easily cut yourself if you interlock
your<00:03:28.760> fingers<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.930> got<00:03:30.080> less<00:03:30.230> chance<00:03:30.260> of

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
your fingers you got less chance of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.970 
your fingers you got less chance of
doing<00:03:30.770> that<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.420> will<00:03:32.420> just<00:03:32.450> give<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.110> go<00:03:33.380> so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
doing that I will just give that a go so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.150 
doing that I will just give that a go so
go<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:36.430> just<00:03:37.430> cut<00:03:37.700> along<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.440> can<00:03:39.440> say<00:03:39.709> just<00:03:40.010> be

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
go in just cut along I can say just be

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160 
go in just cut along I can say just be
so<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:40.850> careful<00:03:40.880> if<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.630> see<00:03:41.780> them<00:03:41.900> using<00:03:42.020> a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
so so careful if you see them using a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.740 
so so careful if you see them using a
nice<00:03:42.380> rocking<00:03:42.830> lip<00:03:43.160> movement<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.850> find<00:03:44.420> that's

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
nice rocking lip movement I find that's

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.660 
nice rocking lip movement I find that's
a<00:03:44.989> lot<00:03:45.290> easier<00:03:45.680> than<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.980> big<00:03:46.160> pause<00:03:46.400> if<00:03:46.580> you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
a lot easier than a big pause if you

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.420 
a lot easier than a big pause if you
slip<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.590> slice<00:03:48.590> your<00:03:48.769> finger<00:03:48.920> open<00:03:49.340> so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
slip and slice your finger open so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.550 
slip and slice your finger open so
that's<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.670> rootstock<00:03:49.940> dumb<00:03:50.980> sign<00:03:51.980> would<00:03:52.310> I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that's the rootstock dumb sign would I

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.390 
that's the rootstock dumb sign would I
say<00:03:54.560> about<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.830> third<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:56.950> nice<00:03:57.950> rocking

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
say about a third in and nice rocking

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.330 
say about a third in and nice rocking
motion<00:03:59.860> here<00:04:00.860> we<00:04:01.010> go<00:04:02.560> well<00:04:03.560> they<00:04:03.920> go<00:04:03.950> some

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
motion here we go well they go some

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.539 
motion here we go well they go some
slightly<00:04:04.670> slip<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.180> little<00:04:05.390> bit<00:04:05.480> there<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.549> you

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
slightly slip a little bit there and you

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.670 
slightly slip a little bit there and you
insert<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.299> two<00:04:08.570> tongues<00:04:09.250> together<00:04:11.680> like

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
insert the two tongues together like

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.180 
insert the two tongues together like
that<00:04:13.720> there<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:14.959> go<00:04:16.479> fantastic<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:18.680> for<00:04:18.979> my<00:04:19.070> up

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
that there we go fantastic so for my up

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.280 
that there we go fantastic so for my up
my<00:04:19.459> fingers<00:04:19.850> aren't<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.180> way<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.200> can

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
my fingers aren't in the way so you can

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.610 
my fingers aren't in the way so you can
see<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.620> tongues<00:04:21.919> are<00:04:22.100> interlocked<00:04:23.620> well

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
see the tongues are interlocked well

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.140 
see the tongues are interlocked well
there<00:04:24.770> also<00:04:24.919> you'll<00:04:25.250> benefit<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.850> one<00:04:26.030> it

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
there also you'll benefit that one it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.850 
there also you'll benefit that one it
gives<00:04:26.390> it<00:04:26.510> stability<00:04:26.690> but<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.290> second<00:04:27.740> one

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
gives it stability but the second one

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.659 
gives it stability but the second one
that<00:04:28.010> I've<00:04:28.130> found<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:30.160> also<00:04:31.160> gives<00:04:31.550> a

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
that I've found is that it also gives a

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.719 
that I've found is that it also gives a
bigger<00:04:32.169> contact<00:04:33.169> area<00:04:33.620> between<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.520> two

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
bigger contact area between the two

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.310 
bigger contact area between the two
where<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.270> rootstock<00:04:35.510> on<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> sign<00:04:36.080> would

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
where the rootstock on the sign would

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.219 
where the rootstock on the sign would
next<00:04:37.280> thing<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.520> do<00:04:37.640> is<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.210> need<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.570> tape<00:04:39.020> it

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
next thing to do is we need to tape it

then I don't have to cut through the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.430 
then I don't have to cut through the
tape<00:05:27.140> and<00:05:27.380> damage<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.810> tree<00:05:30.280> trough<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.460> XS

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
where I'm applying the wax onto their

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.490 
where I'm applying the wax onto their
back<00:05:44.810> in<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.050> mouth

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
back in the mouth

okay<00:05:46.430> back<00:05:46.700> again<00:05:47.030> I'll<00:05:47.150> heat<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.480> wax<00:05:47.600> up

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
okay back again I'll heat the wax up

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.510 
okay back again I'll heat the wax up
what<00:05:48.560> I'm<00:05:48.650> gonna<00:05:48.740> do<00:05:48.980> is<00:05:49.100> I'm<00:05:49.220> gonna<00:05:49.310> give

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.050 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give
these<00:05:50.450> three<00:05:50.870> bolts<00:05:51.169> on<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:52.580> then<00:05:52.669> just<00:05:52.850> cook

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
these three bolts on and then just cook

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.090 
these three bolts on and then just cook
after<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.870> third<00:05:54.140> ball<00:05:54.440> then<00:05:54.590> this<00:05:54.950> you've

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
after the third ball then this you've

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.590 
after the third ball then this you've
got<00:05:55.190> three<00:05:55.940> chances<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.600> it<00:05:56.720> taking<00:05:57.530> off<00:05:58.600> so

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
got three chances of it taking off so

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.840 
got three chances of it taking off so
we'll<00:05:59.720> lose<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.080> across<00:06:00.290> there<00:06:00.590> right<00:06:00.850> on

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
we'll lose that across there right on

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.370 
we'll lose that across there right on
with<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.120> wax<00:06:02.830> so<00:06:03.830> I've<00:06:03.919> melted<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.340> in<00:06:04.490> Mateen

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
with the wax so I've melted it in Mateen

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.330 
with the wax so I've melted it in Mateen
I've<00:06:06.380> actually<00:06:06.530> used<00:06:06.680> like<00:06:06.919> a<00:06:06.950> George<00:06:07.280> Foreman

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340
