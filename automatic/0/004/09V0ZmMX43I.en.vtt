00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.160
 playstation 4 or xbox when which 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.320
 console makes the next generation race 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.080
 no question concerns the video players 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.639
 community currently more than this we 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.259
 Therefore do the very sober 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.059
 direct comparison and leave the consoles 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.779
 from microsoft and sony against each other 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.420
 compete 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.000
 based on the king category hardware and 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.429
 Technology controller brought media and 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.019
 online features games as well as prize and 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:31.269
 release date we make the next 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:33.610
 generation check on paper are you 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.320
 the two consoles are very similar both 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.600
 microsoft as well as sony put on 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.420
 processor on 8 cores populate your 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.340
 boxes each with 8 gb of working memory 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.980
 a blu ray drive and a 500 gb 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.289
 hard disk, however, are technology 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.480
 Experts and developers agree on the ps4 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.440
 still has a tick more hardware power 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.850
 that's because in the sony console 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.760
 gddr5 memory is installed 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.550
 which in turn has a bandwidth of 176 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.550
 gigabit per second delivers the xbox 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.379
 crew as only 68 gb as well 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.869
 also the graphics chip of the ps4 with its 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.780
 18 control units theoretically more fixed than 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.580
 his xbox ponto oh yes the hard drive 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.710
 the ps4 can be compared to the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 the xbox one exchange one can the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.600
 expand capacity 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.750
 That's why this point is approaching 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.770
 the ps4 the gamepads of the two 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.390
 upcoming consoles are 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.140
 further development and its famous 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.330
 predecessor 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.470
 microsoft relies on the 360 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.360
 known design 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.700
 However, the school are now with 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 a cool vibration function 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.360
 equipped Sony's dual shock 4 is coming 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.369
 same with several innovations therefore 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.289
 located on the front of the pads 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.789
 a small touch surface on 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.350
 the back side is a lightbar 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.180
 medium of his coloring for example 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.360
 the life energy of your pawn to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.960
 also shows the famous sixaxis 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.490
 Motion sensors are back on with 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.530
 shelf 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.750
 apropos movement kinect is more central 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.850
 ingredient of the xbox one without the camera 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.460
 goes to the microsoft console even 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.140
 not all menus and just as well 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.819
 some games can be done by gestures and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.560
 voice commands are controlled 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.739
 which hopefully works better than 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.660
 still with the xbox 360 sony stops 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.060
 playstation move offers the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.410
 appropriate hardware but optional 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.239
 Finally, the choice is the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.280
 controllers still a matter of taste 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.560
 So we will consider this category as one 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 deserved draw 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.800
 after the pr disaster on the e3 has 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.610
 Microsoft will be online again 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.069
 given up 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.629
 So the xbox does not have to be all 24 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.730
 hours once with the internet 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.500
 be connected and used bought 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.670
 games should now suddenly without 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.099
 be usable fee 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.200
 The same applies to the ps4, too 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.280
 works old fashioned offline 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 but of course you can 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.760
 not all the great internet 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.319
 knickknack use both sony as 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 also microsoft put on an abo 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.090
 service xbox live and playstation bare 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.250
 will cost just under 50 euros a year and 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.959
 in addition to the usual online gaming some 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.519
 offer cool additional functions 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.989
 on both consoles you can 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.700
 for example, your best game scenes 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.739
 Record and share them online with yours 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.599
 friends or the whole world 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.459
 Of course, both consoles blu 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.860
 ray films and music play and 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.660
 show pictures a big difference 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.519
 However, the xbox one is in the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.980
 contrary to ps4 on tv channels 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.910
 streams total end of this category 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.910
 thus with one 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.450
 draw for both next gen 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.329
 Consoles have already been numerous 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.400
 Exclusive games announced during Sony 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.640
 with cheese and shadow of all drive works 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.799
 deep down the order tsx and infirmis 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.180
 Eck wants to score ten points 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.640
 on 5453 scranton break and dead rising 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.620
 3 as the support from the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 publisher and at indie developer 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.609
 Both consoles are equally big 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.709
 and microsoft its regional lock 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.239
 has given up now also ends 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:59.430
 This comparison with a brief but 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:04:00.930
 drew both consoles 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.000
 should world-wide later this year 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.599
 probably in november on the market 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.019
 come 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.970
 however, the ps4 will be 399 euros and 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.519
 100 euros less than the xbox 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.769
 living expenses and also without the 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.200
 Camera still needs to be bought separately 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.700
 this point clearly 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.620
 So the ps4 we summarize 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.870
 the playstation 4 wins in the rubric 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.550
 hardware and technology as well as the price 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.560
 at the controller and the 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.090
 control options and at the 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.010
 play and the multimedia features 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.180
 fights for the xbox want, however 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.830
 a draw 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.720
 Thus , the winner in ours 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.840
 nextgen consoles comparison despite 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.290
 microsoft changed online politics 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.540
 playstation 4 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.580
 Let's see if microsoft this residue 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.330
 until the release of the two consoles yet 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.330
 can catch up
