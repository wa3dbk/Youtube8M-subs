00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
bike my father bought me when I was in

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.009 
bike my father bought me when I was in
high<00:00:08.130> school<00:00:08.189> yes<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.269> was<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.630> high<00:00:09.719> school<00:00:09.750> in

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
high school yes I was in high school in

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.580 
high school yes I was in high school in
87<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.679> actually<00:00:10.800> graduated<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.780> 1990<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.960> year

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
87 I actually graduated in 1990 a year

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.189 
87 I actually graduated in 1990 a year
early<00:00:13.920> though<00:00:14.599> so<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> guess<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:16.080> put

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
early though so I guess that would put

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.250 
early though so I guess that would put
me<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> class<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> 91<00:00:17.039> normally<00:00:18.000> anyway<00:00:18.449> so

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
me in a class of 91 normally anyway so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260 
me in a class of 91 normally anyway so
this<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> bike<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.800> he<00:00:20.130> bought<00:00:20.310> me<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
this is the bike that he bought me I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
this is the bike that he bought me I
remember<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.320> went<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> bike<00:00:22.740> store<00:00:22.949> we

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
remember we went to the bike store we

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
remember we went to the bike store we
paid<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> nose<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
paid out the nose for it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
paid out the nose for it
I<00:00:25.230> remember<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> mail-order<00:00:26.160> catalogs<00:00:26.640> had

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
I remember the mail-order catalogs had

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
I remember the mail-order catalogs had
it<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.330> substantially<00:00:28.019> less<00:00:28.230> than<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.560> money

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it for substantially less than the money

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
it for substantially less than the money
we<00:00:28.859> paid<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.519> paid<00:00:29.760> five

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we paid for it I think we paid five

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
we paid for it I think we paid five
hundred<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.990> fifty<00:00:31.199> dollars<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:32.309> would

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
hundred and fifty dollars which would

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.240 
hundred and fifty dollars which would
probably<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.300> 80<00:00:33.840> model<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.070> mail

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
probably about me 80 model if I had mail

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
probably about me 80 model if I had mail
ordered<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.360> any<00:00:36.510> case<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:36.930> very

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
ordered it but in any case I was very

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
here some citric acid powder which

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.090 
here some citric acid powder which
actually<00:01:25.110> sounds<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.619> ominous<00:01:26.070> than

actually sounds a lot more ominous than

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.590 
actually sounds a lot more ominous than
what<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.939> literally<00:01:27.570> just

what it really is it's literally just

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.249 
what it really is it's literally just
citric<00:01:28.439> acid<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.360> comes<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.540> lemons<00:01:30.990> and

of it for about twenty bucks and this is
non-food<00:01:46.229> grade<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.890> mix<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.579> there

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
non-food grade but you mix it in there

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.639 
non-food grade but you mix it in there
and<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> basically<00:01:48.180> creates<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.899> concentrated

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and it basically creates a concentrated

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
and it basically creates a concentrated
such<00:01:49.890> add<00:01:50.009> acid<00:01:50.369> solution<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.659> then

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
such add acid solution which I'm then

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.450 
such add acid solution which I'm then
gonna<00:01:52.110> put<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.829> may<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:52.979> wondering

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
gonna put in there you may be wondering

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
why I have bricks in there and that's to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.319 
why I have bricks in there and that's to
take<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> volume<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> don't

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
take up some of the volume so I don't

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.389 
take up some of the volume so I don't
have<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.600> use<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> I'm<00:01:59.219> hoping
