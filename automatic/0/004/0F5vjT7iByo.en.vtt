00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.589 
and key point is shown by a dashed line
okay<00:02:19.860> let's<00:02:20.099> redo<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.760> step<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> few

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
okay let's redo that step for a few

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:29.780 
okay let's redo that step for a few
points<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.959> close<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.500> busiest<00:02:28.860> line<00:02:29.190> just

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
points to close the busiest line just

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.910 
points to close the busiest line just
tap<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.329> screen<00:02:30.450> near<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> first<00:02:31.560> point

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.309 

okay<00:02:34.920> nice<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.549> course<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.720> also<00:02:36.989> throw

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
okay nice of course you can also throw

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.860 
okay nice of course you can also throw
hard<00:02:37.680> corns<00:02:38.129> with<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.579> tool<00:02:38.819> just<00:02:39.629> by

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
hard corns with this tool just by

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.009 
hard corns with this tool just by
tabbing<00:02:40.319> in<00:02:40.470> some<00:02:40.680> key<00:02:41.159> points<00:02:41.659> before<00:02:42.659> we

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
tabbing in some key points before we

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.470 
tabbing in some key points before we
come<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.500> next<00:02:43.769> tools<00:02:44.250> let's<00:02:44.790> take<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> look

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
come to the next tools let's take a look

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.949 
come to the next tools let's take a look
inside<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.230> layer<00:02:46.410> manager<00:02:47.060> as<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.420> see<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
inside the layer manager as you see the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.550 
inside the layer manager as you see the
layers<00:02:49.170> are<00:02:49.680> shown<00:02:50.190> inside<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.849> table<00:02:51.239> view

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
layers are shown inside the table view

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.160 
layers are shown inside the table view
you<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.739> four<00:02:53.069> functions<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:53.910> add<00:02:54.780> layer

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you have four functions here add layer

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.819 
you have four functions here add layer
delete<00:02:55.799> layer<00:02:56.250> rename<00:02:56.970> layer<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.840> reorder

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
delete layer rename layer and reorder

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.000 
delete layer rename layer and reorder
layer<00:02:59.239> first<00:03:00.239> let's<00:03:00.629> rename<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.470> count<00:03:01.739> layer

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
layer first let's rename the count layer

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.430 
layer first let's rename the count layer
to<00:03:02.280> spline<00:03:07.909> and<00:03:08.909> now<00:03:09.329> let's<00:03:09.659> add<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> new<00:03:10.200> layer

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
to spline and now let's add a new layer

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.720 
to spline and now let's add a new layer
let's<00:03:10.980> name<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.310> shakes<00:03:16.069> okay<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.310> currently

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
let's name it shakes okay the currently

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.210 
let's name it shakes okay the currently
added<00:03:18.269> layer<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.989> always<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.680> active<00:03:20.040> layer

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
added layer is always the active layer

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.000 
added layer is always the active layer
so<00:03:21.000> let's<00:03:21.209> go<00:03:21.419> back<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> color<00:03:22.319> selector

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
so let's go back to the color selector

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.740 
so let's go back to the color selector
and<00:03:23.220> setup<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:23.880> new<00:03:24.299> column<00:03:29.000> now<00:03:30.000> let's<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:30.480> back

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
and setup a new column now let's go back

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.289 
and setup a new column now let's go back
to<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.109> tool<00:03:31.349> selector<00:03:31.980> let's<00:03:32.819> select<00:03:33.090> the
