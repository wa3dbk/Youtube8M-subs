00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
know if there was a hack available for

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.990 
know if there was a hack available for
this<00:00:33.660> game<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.610> shadow

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
this game so there is we have shadow

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
this game so there is we have shadow
right<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.690> he<00:00:36.899> has<00:00:36.989> new<00:00:37.260> sprites<00:00:37.620> Sonic

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
right here and he has new sprites Sonic

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.080 
right here and he has new sprites Sonic
has<00:00:37.980> new<00:00:38.129> sprites<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.940> thing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.350 
has new sprites and all kind of thing
there<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.719> know<00:00:39.840> shadow<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:41.360> but

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
there are you know shadow is here but

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.479 
there are you know shadow is here but
this<00:00:42.570> hack<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.590> unfinished

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this hack is really unfinished

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.110 
this hack is really unfinished
now<00:00:44.879> when<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> say<00:00:45.510> unfinished<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.920> mean

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
now when I say unfinished I really mean

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.369 
now when I say unfinished I really mean
there<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.510> small<00:00:48.719> things<00:00:49.110> which

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
there was just these small things which

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.900 
there was just these small things which
could<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.010> made<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> hack<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.760> better

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
could have made the hack a little better

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.299 
could have made the hack a little better
for<00:00:51.059> example<00:00:51.449> Sonic's<00:00:52.140> life<00:00:52.320> icon<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:53.010> there

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
for example Sonic's life icon down there

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.490 
for example Sonic's life icon down there
it<00:00:53.460> still<00:00:53.760> says<00:00:54.000> Sonic<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.660> obviously

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it still says Sonic and obviously

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.189 
it still says Sonic and obviously
Sonic's<00:00:55.980> still<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.670> bottom<00:00:57.000> left<00:00:57.120> icon<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
Sonic's still very bottom left icon is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.849 
Sonic's still very bottom left icon is
just<00:00:58.440> gray<00:00:58.680> and<00:01:00.289> for<00:01:01.289> example<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
just gray and for example there are

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
just gray and for example there are
still<00:01:02.129> some<00:01:02.430> Sonic<00:01:02.789> sprites<00:01:03.059> present<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
still some Sonic sprites present in the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.370 
still some Sonic sprites present in the
game<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.710> example<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.229> where

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
game for example you know you know where

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
game for example you know you know where
like<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.650> turn<00:01:07.830> super<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.640> still<00:01:09.090> super

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
like you turn super it's still super

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
like you turn super it's still super
sonic<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.229> reason<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.920> super

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
sonic like for some reason the super

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.660 
sonic like for some reason the super
sonic<00:01:11.580> sprites<00:01:12.270> aren't<00:01:12.540> changed<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> shadow

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
sonic sprites aren't changed to shadow

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
sonic sprites aren't changed to shadow
there<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.659> example<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.080> ice<00:01:16.290> cap

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there are also for example on ice cap

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.429 
there are also for example on ice cap
zone<00:01:16.590> act<00:01:16.950> 1<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.900> shadow<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
zone act 1 you don't see shadow on the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.810 
zone act 1 you don't see shadow on the
board<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> great<00:01:20.189> sonic<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.700> just

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
board it's just a great sonic it's just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.160 
board it's just a great sonic it's just
these<00:01:20.939> things<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.720> could<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:21.930> made

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
these things which just could have made

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
these things which just could have made
the<00:01:22.290> hack<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> little<00:01:22.950> better<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.299> hack

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the hack a little better what this hack

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
the hack a little better what this hack
is<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.170> decent<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> mean<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.100> we

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is it's pretty decent I mean like we

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
is it's pretty decent I mean like we
have<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.090> regular<00:01:30.600> sprites<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.079> mean<00:01:31.200> he's<00:01:31.350> got

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
have the regular sprites I mean he's got

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.289 
have the regular sprites I mean he's got
his<00:01:31.650> jumping<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.759> he's<00:01:32.880> obviously<00:01:33.030> got

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
his jumping you know he's obviously got

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.810 
his jumping you know he's obviously got
his<00:01:33.590> crouching<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.280> looking<00:01:35.549> up

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
his crouching or you know looking up

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
his crouching or you know looking up
he's<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.390> about<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> regular<00:01:37.200> sprites<00:01:37.530> but

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770

which<00:01:39.509> would<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:41.040> would

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
which would have like you know it would

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.740 
which would have like you know it would
have<00:01:41.340> made<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> hack<00:01:42.240> feel<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> little

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
have made this the hack feel a little

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.350 
have made this the hack feel a little
more<00:01:42.899> complete<00:01:43.759> now<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.060> actually

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
more complete now there is actually

more complete now there is actually
another<00:01:45.390> hack<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.259> game<00:01:46.439> which<00:01:46.619> does

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
another hack for this game which does

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
another hack for this game which does

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
description but the hack I can't find
the<00:01:53.100> hack<00:01:53.310> anywhere<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.180> looks<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.630> 10

the hack anywhere and it looks like 10

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
the hack anywhere and it looks like 10
times<00:01:55.470> bad<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> hack<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.490> playing<00:01:56.700> right

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.990 
times bad and the hack I'm playing right
now

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
now

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.380 
now
thing<00:01:58.900> is<00:01:59.050> with<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.290> hack<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.800> like<00:02:00.280> it's<00:02:00.520> it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
thing is with that hack is like it's it

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.740 
thing is with that hack is like it's it
looks<00:02:01.600> complete<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.170> me<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.350> mean<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:03.750> there's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
looks complete to me I mean like there's

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.630 
looks complete to me I mean like there's
more<00:02:04.990> sprites<00:02:05.380> available<00:02:05.860> for<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.400> fact

there's actually super shallow sprites

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.020 
there's actually super shallow sprites
in<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.100> game<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.369> well<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.850> could

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
in the game as well so you could

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.280 
in the game as well so you could
actually<00:02:10.179> go<00:02:10.360> on<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.479> doomsday<00:02:10.929> zone<00:02:11.140> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
actually beat it with shadow that hack

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.350 
actually beat it with shadow that hack
felt<00:02:14.800> really<00:02:15.160> really<00:02:15.520> complete<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.120> mean<00:02:16.270> it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
this hack is just unfinished but you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.770 
this hack is just unfinished but you
know<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.209> way<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.330> see<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:52.060> I'm<00:02:52.270> on<00:02:52.390> also

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
know the way I see it like I'm on also

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.940 
know the way I see it like I'm on also
there's<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.080> no<00:02:53.230> abilities<00:02:53.680> or<00:02:53.800> anything

there's like no abilities or anything
but<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.700> way<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> see<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.290> was

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
but the way I see it is that it was

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.260 
but the way I see it is that it was
pretty<00:02:56.680> much<00:02:56.800> exactly<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.430> same<00:02:57.550> as<00:02:57.970> Sonic

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
pretty much exactly the same as Sonic

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.320 
pretty much exactly the same as Sonic
and<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.450> sangwich<00:02:58.840> 2<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.580> with<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:00.700> hack<00:03:01.000> he

and of sangwich 2 and with this hack he

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.360 
and of sangwich 2 and with this hack he
has<00:03:01.570> no<00:03:01.900> new<00:03:02.140> abilities<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:02.890> not<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.160> he's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
has no new abilities it's not like he's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.220 
has no new abilities it's not like he's
got<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:04.000> chaos<00:03:04.330> control<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:04.840> anything<00:03:04.989> like

got like chaos control or anything like

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.840 
got like chaos control or anything like
that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.410 
that
he's<00:03:06.850> just<00:03:07.060> Sonic<00:03:07.450> really<00:03:08.820> it's<00:03:09.820> not<00:03:10.060> too<00:03:10.239> bad

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
he's just Sonic really it's not too bad

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.699 
he's just Sonic really it's not too bad
I<00:03:10.480> mean<00:03:10.660> if<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.290> desperate<00:03:11.500> to

I mean if you really that desperate to
play<00:03:11.920> shadow<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.610> hack<00:03:12.820> would

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
play shadow then this hack would

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.789 
play shadow then this hack would
probably<00:03:13.420> decent<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.560> know<00:03:14.650> he's

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
probably decent for you you know he's

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.800 
probably decent for you you know he's
got<00:03:14.950> his<00:03:15.040> regular<00:03:15.250> well<00:03:15.580> his<00:03:15.850> some<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
got his regular well his some of the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.240 
got his regular well his some of the
sprite<00:03:17.080> placement<00:03:17.560> could<00:03:17.680> be<00:03:17.739> better<00:03:18.010> for

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
sprite placement could be better for

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.130 
sprite placement could be better for
example<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.700> when<00:03:18.850> he<00:03:18.940> looks<00:03:19.150> up<00:03:19.360> his<00:03:19.660> sprite

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
example like when he looks up his sprite

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.830 
example like when he looks up his sprite
kind<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.470> twitches<00:03:20.980> down<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> little<00:03:21.459> bit<00:03:21.840> it's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
kind of twitches down a little bit it's

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.960 
kind of twitches down a little bit it's
pretty<00:03:23.110> noticeable<00:03:23.519> but<00:03:24.519> if<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:24.820> want

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
pretty noticeable but if you just want

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.920 
pretty noticeable but if you just want
to<00:03:25.030> go<00:03:25.120> through<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.390> game<00:03:25.540> with<00:03:25.690> shadow

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
to go through the game with shadow

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.020 
to go through the game with shadow
sprites<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:26.829> I'm<00:03:27.100> sure<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.549> will<00:03:27.670> be<00:03:27.790> fine

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
sprites then I'm sure this will be fine

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.509 
sprites then I'm sure this will be fine
for<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.329> I<00:03:28.360> mean<00:03:28.600> it's<00:03:29.049> not<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.440> terrible<00:03:30.250> hack

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
for you I mean it's not a terrible hack

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.830 
for you I mean it's not a terrible hack

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
don't get me wrong I mean I wouldn't

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.810 
don't get me wrong I mean I wouldn't
know<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.049> first<00:03:32.260> thing<00:03:32.470> about<00:03:32.530> coding<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.640> hack

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
know the first thing about coding a hack

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.600 
know the first thing about coding a hack
or<00:03:34.000> anything<00:03:34.180> but<00:03:34.450> um<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:35.769> know<00:03:35.799> shadow<00:03:36.430> is

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
or anything but um you know shadow is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.460 
or anything but um you know shadow is
present<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:37.450> all<00:03:37.630> which<00:03:37.780> really

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
present and that's all which really

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.380 
present and that's all which really
matters<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:38.920> guess<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.459> as<00:03:39.850> long<00:03:40.000> as<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.209> kind

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
matters I guess and as long as you kind

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.960 
matters I guess and as long as you kind
of<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:41.019> ignore<00:03:41.470> some<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.920> odd<00:03:42.400> Sonic

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
of like ignore some of the odd Sonic

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.880 
of like ignore some of the odd Sonic
sprites<00:03:43.329> which<00:03:43.510> appear<00:03:43.870> now<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.410> again<00:03:44.620> and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
sprites which appear now and again and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.720 
sprites which appear now and again and
the<00:03:45.370> Sonic<00:03:45.970> icon<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.450> bottom<00:03:46.480> left<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:47.730> mean

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
the Sonic icon on the bottom left I mean

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.770 
the Sonic icon on the bottom left I mean
like<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.910> said<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.269> there's<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.750> little

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
like I said like there's just the little

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.539 
like I said like there's just the little
things<00:03:50.049> could<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.530> made<00:03:50.920> this<00:03:51.070> hack<00:03:51.340> look

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
things could have made this hack look

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.580 
things could have made this hack look
I'm<00:03:51.850> hell<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> lot<00:03:52.480> better<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.410> a

I'm hell of a lot better it's just a

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.289 
I'm hell of a lot better it's just a

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
shame that I can't find out other hack

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.880 
shame that I can't find out other hack
anywhere<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.690> mean<00:03:55.840> if<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.110> could<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> would<00:03:56.680> link

anywhere I mean if I could I would link
you<00:03:57.549> will<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.820> it<00:03:57.940> because<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.180> wouldn't<00:03:58.329> great

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you will do it because it wouldn't great

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.350 
you will do it because it wouldn't great
but<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.070> know<00:04:00.190> if<00:04:00.340> there<00:04:00.519> if<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.910> new<00:04:01.060> shadow

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
but you know if there if a new shadow

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.930 
but you know if there if a new shadow

have made it better but you know if
someone<00:04:19.450> can<00:04:19.570> make<00:04:19.600> an<00:04:19.810> Amy<00:04:20.019> hack<00:04:20.290> for<00:04:20.500> this

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
someone can make an Amy hack for this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.200 
someone can make an Amy hack for this
game<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:21.040> her<00:04:21.130> sprites<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.580> pink<00:04:21.850> then<00:04:22.090> I'm

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
game and her sprites a pink then I'm

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.310 
game and her sprites a pink then I'm
pretty<00:04:22.330> sure<00:04:22.570> someone<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:22.900> make<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.050> shadow

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
pretty sure someone can make a shadow

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.640 
pretty sure someone can make a shadow
hack<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.330> also<00:04:25.330> shadow<00:04:25.630> hacking<00:04:26.050> sonic<00:04:26.350> 1<00:04:26.530> is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
hack and also shadow hacking sonic 1 is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.770 
hack and also shadow hacking sonic 1 is
available<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.790> would<00:04:28.000> be<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:28.420> great<00:04:28.750> to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
available so it would be really great to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.960 
available so it would be really great to
see<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.110> hypersonic<00:04:29.650> through<00:04:29.920> knuckles
