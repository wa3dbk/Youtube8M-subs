sure if you guys have noticed but a
normal<00:03:14.229> tnt<00:03:14.590> would<00:03:14.739> only<00:03:14.889> drop<00:03:15.310> thirty

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
normal tnt would only drop thirty

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.930 
normal tnt would only drop thirty
percent<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.269> destroyed<00:03:16.599> box<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.290> this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
percent of the destroyed box but this

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.080 
percent of the destroyed box but this
you'll<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.180> something<00:03:19.419> different<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.970> will<00:03:21.970> do

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
you'll do something different I will do

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.080 
you'll do something different I will do
something<00:03:22.269> more<00:03:22.599> which<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.409> will<00:03:23.729> drop<00:03:24.729> every

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
something more which it will drop every

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.969 
something more which it will drop every
single<00:03:25.419> block<00:03:25.659> it<00:03:25.840> destroys<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.859> see

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
single block it destroys you can see

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.280 
single block it destroys you can see
