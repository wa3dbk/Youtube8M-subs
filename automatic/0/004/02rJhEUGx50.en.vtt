00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.580
 you imagine swimming among millions of 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.190
 jellyfish to anyone who is 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.980
 come this in your head you will think it is 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.950
 dangerous after all the jellyfish 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.689
 they have a kind of stinging hairs 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.570
 that when making contact with human skin 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.519
 They can cause enough 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.349
 damage and there are even some jellyfish that 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.259
 they can kill that they are very 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.099
 poisonous as is for example the wasp 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.950
 murderous but there is a place in the world 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.800
 concrete there is only one place in the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.890
 which a person can swim by touching the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.670
 jellyfish without it happening absolutely 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.699
 nothing this place is called lake dolphins and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.800
 let's post some pictures of this 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.820
 place for you to see that what I say no 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.430
 it's no invention these jellyfish have 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.160
 lost his poison 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.380
 8 million jellyfish are found in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.180
 this region on the island palms in the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.640
 micronesia region in the ocean 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.590
 pacific and the people that you see 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.020
 then they are people who are 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.320
 swimming between nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.420
 8 million jellyfish is a type of 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.840
 subspecies of jellyfish that has gone 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.750
 losing attack capabilities 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.869
 and defense that would be the sting and that 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.030
 they are practically harmless so they 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.840
 can swim with complete peace of mind 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.149
 the jellyfish and touch the ones that will not 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.729
 practically nothing these photos have been 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.000
 taken by photographer kevin davidson 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.340
 51 years old who joined the brave 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.259
 to capture the beauty of jellyfish 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.259
 in the lake with his camera 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.820
 some people should have and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 get in these places but 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.700
 I already say that these jellyfish are not 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.220
 they have the nematocysts that are the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.950
 charged with injecting that poison into 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.050
 through the stinging hairs and so 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.410
 so there is no danger that a 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.959
 person can get hurt if by the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.850
 otherwise they were dangerous jellyfish and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.020
 a person was swimming between 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.560
 these jellyfish would automatically die 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.090
 because thousands of bites of 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.890
 any jellyfish can finish 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.620
 perfectly with any human being 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.690
 but this is not the case and you can 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.570
 consider these jellyfish as 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.000
 harmless so if you're ever going to 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.670
 travel keep in mind that there is a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.530
 place in the world in which you can 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.530
 to swim among jellyfish
