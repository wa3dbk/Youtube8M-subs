belt<00:00:25.140> yeah<00:00:25.880> it's<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.060> old<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
belt yeah it's pretty old but to do this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.920 
belt yeah it's pretty old but to do this
I<00:00:30.810> need<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.109> take<00:00:31.260> off<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.590> fan<00:00:31.859> belt

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.590 

I<00:00:38.600> think<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:43.160> gonna<00:00:43.760> start<00:00:44.150> with<00:00:44.390> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
I think that gonna start with the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.380 
I think that gonna start with the
battery<00:00:44.960> disconnect<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.620> battery<00:00:46.390> battery

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
battery disconnect the battery battery

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.810 
battery disconnect the battery battery
actually<00:00:47.510> connects<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.110> there<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.830> I'll<00:00:49.610> take

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
actually connects to there so I'll take

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.410 
actually connects to there so I'll take
the<00:00:50.260> hole

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.390 

shroud<00:00:54.200> off<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:57.250> another<00:00:58.250> video<00:00:58.489> shortly

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
shroud off and another video shortly
