00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this today somebody else ecstacy how are

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.030 
this today somebody else ecstacy how are
detangle<00:01:02.309> my<00:01:02.430> hair<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.270> typically<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:04.040> my

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
detangle my hair and I typically use my

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.850 
detangle my hair and I typically use my
Denman<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:08.570> center<00:01:09.570> row<00:01:09.750> Denman<00:01:10.260> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
Denman this is the center row Denman so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
Denman this is the center row Denman so
it<00:01:10.979> looks<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.600> spacious

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it looks like this a bit more spacious

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.800 
it looks like this a bit more spacious
than<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.470> typical<00:01:14.360> Denman<00:01:17.330> that's<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
than the typical Denman that's kind of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460 
than the typical Denman that's kind of
spaced<00:01:19.140> together<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> see

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
spaced together like this so you can see

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.840 
spaced together like this so you can see
the<00:01:22.799> difference<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.009> found<00:01:26.310> my

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the difference and I have now found my

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.920 
the difference and I have now found my
tangle<00:01:27.420> teezer

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
tangle teezer

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.039 
tangle teezer
so<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> am<00:01:29.430> probably<00:01:29.820> gonna<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.720> well

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
so I am probably gonna use that as well

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.670 
so I am probably gonna use that as well
and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.549> am<00:01:33.000> also<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> show<00:01:34.350> how<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and then I am also going to show how I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.240 
and then I am also going to show how I
wash<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.400> hair<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.350> include<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.040> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
wash my hair so that I can include it in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.499 
wash my hair so that I can include it in
my<00:01:38.430> regimen<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:40.040> for<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.189> video<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.090> hair

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
my regimen so for that video this hair

my regimen so for that video this hair
has<00:01:42.840> conditioner<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
just take one section at a time and I've

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.069 
just take one section at a time and I've
pretty<00:02:36.459> much<00:02:36.579> detangle<00:02:37.299> it<00:02:37.329> I<00:02:37.569> mean<00:02:37.780> it's

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
pretty much detangle it I mean it's
