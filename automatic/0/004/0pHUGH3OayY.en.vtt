00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
were weak where where are you weak well

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600

I<00:00:25.630> did<00:00:25.990> we're<00:00:26.740> very<00:00:26.920> weak<00:00:27.130> at<00:00:27.280> the<00:00:27.310> five<00:00:27.580> spot

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
I did we're very weak at the five spot

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.400 
I did we're very weak at the five spot
right<00:00:28.119> now<00:00:28.330> we're<00:00:28.540> very<00:00:28.570> weak<00:00:28.930> at<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.110> three

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
right now we're very weak at the three

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.320 
right now we're very weak at the three
spot<00:00:29.680> we're<00:00:30.310> not<00:00:30.430> getting<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.790> whole<00:00:30.910> lot<00:00:30.970> we're

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
spot we're not getting a whole lot we're

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.400 
spot we're not getting a whole lot we're
not<00:00:31.450> getting<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.779> whole<00:00:31.869> lot<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.080> out<00:00:32.260> of<00:00:32.290> a

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
not getting a whole lot of out of a

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.520 
not getting a whole lot of out of a
front<00:00:32.680> court<00:00:32.890> right<00:00:33.100> now<00:00:33.900> in<00:00:34.900> our<00:00:35.020> back<00:00:35.260> court

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
front court right now in our back court

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.060 
front court right now in our back court
has<00:00:35.710> got<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:35.920> create<00:00:36.190> more<00:00:36.370> assists<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.860> get

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
has got to create more assists to get

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.400 
has got to create more assists to get
them<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:40.270> play<00:00:40.420> better<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:43.750> think<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:44.350> is

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
them to play better but I think this is

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.390 
them to play better but I think this is
a<00:00:44.590> very<00:00:45.420> inexperienced<00:00:46.420> team<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:48.220> will

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
a very inexperienced team that will

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.740 
a very inexperienced team that will
learn<00:00:48.640> an<00:00:48.790> awful<00:00:48.879> lot<00:00:49.150> I<00:00:49.210> think<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:49.540> was<00:00:49.720> a

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
learn an awful lot I think this was a

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.930 
learn an awful lot I think this was a
very<00:00:50.020> good<00:00:50.320> lesson<00:00:50.710> for<00:00:50.860> them<00:00:51.040> because<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:51.790> won

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
very good lesson for them because we won

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.009 
very good lesson for them because we won
last<00:00:52.180> year<00:00:52.510> we're<00:00:52.629> national<00:00:52.840> champions

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
last year we're national champions

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.869 
last year we're national champions
because<00:00:53.589> our<00:00:53.830> defense<00:00:54.220> was<00:00:54.400> tops<00:00:54.699> in<00:00:54.820> the

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
because our defense was tops in the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.299 
because our defense was tops in the
nation<00:00:55.269> and<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:56.500> quite<00:00:56.680> evident<00:00:56.830> tonight

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
nation and it's quite evident tonight

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.829 
nation and it's quite evident tonight
that<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.030> not<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.390> same<00:00:58.420> team

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
that this is not the same team

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.979 
that this is not the same team
defensively<00:00:59.790> as<00:01:00.790> we<00:01:01.030> had<00:01:01.150> last<00:01:01.300> year<00:01:01.479> so<00:01:01.750> we

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
defensively as we had last year so we

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.840 
defensively as we had last year so we
miss<00:01:02.199> Corky<00:01:02.559> Shang's<00:01:02.830> present<00:01:03.339> presence

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
miss Corky Shang's present presence

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.260 
miss Corky Shang's present presence
inside<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:06.010> certainly<00:01:06.250> are<00:01:06.820> not<00:01:06.880> very

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
inside and we certainly are not very

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.880 
inside and we certainly are not very
good<00:01:07.630> defensively<00:01:08.140> at<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.409> three<00:01:08.620> four<00:01:08.860> and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
good defensively at the three four and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190 
good defensively at the three four and
five<00:01:09.159> spot<00:01:09.720> looked<00:01:10.720> like<00:01:10.870> you<00:01:11.020> might<00:01:11.170> have

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
five spot looked like you might have

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.260 
five spot looked like you might have
tried<00:01:11.440> a<00:01:11.500> little<00:01:11.680> zone<00:01:12.040> or<00:01:12.460> more<00:01:12.790> of<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.000> look

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
tried a little zone or more of that look

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.960 
tried a little zone or more of that look
than<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.570> saw<00:01:13.750> all<00:01:13.900> year<00:01:14.200> how<00:01:14.860> did<00:01:15.040> that<00:01:15.190> go<00:01:15.370> and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
than we saw all year how did that go and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.880 
than we saw all year how did that go and
you<00:01:16.270> know<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.750> really<00:01:16.930> didn't<00:01:17.290> hurt<00:01:17.470> whether

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
you know it really didn't hurt whether

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.590 
you know it really didn't hurt whether
it<00:01:18.010> was<00:01:18.130> owned<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.370> man<00:01:18.729> we<00:01:18.909> kept<00:01:19.150> getting<00:01:19.240> beat

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
it was owned a man we kept getting beat

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.620 
it was owned a man we kept getting beat
off<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.780> dribble<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.760> can't<00:01:22.240> do<00:01:22.420> that

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
off the dribble and you can't do that

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.780 
off the dribble and you can't do that
and<00:01:22.840> then<00:01:23.380> when<00:01:23.740> you're<00:01:23.890> forced<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.340> rotate

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
and then when you're forced to rotate

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.570 
and then when you're forced to rotate
the<00:01:25.240> new<00:01:25.390> rules<00:01:25.770> make<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.920> rotate<00:01:27.340> quite<00:01:27.550> a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
the new rules make you rotate quite a

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.940 
the new rules make you rotate quite a
bit<00:01:27.790> so<00:01:28.720> you've<00:01:28.990> got<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.290> have<00:01:29.410> people<00:01:29.710> from

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
bit so you've got to have people from

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.560 
bit so you've got to have people from
the<00:01:30.100> weak<00:01:30.250> side<00:01:30.280> rebound<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:31.000> ball<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.450> we're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
the weak side rebound the ball and we're

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.650 
the weak side rebound the ball and we're
not<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.960> know<00:01:31.990> we<00:01:32.980> had<00:01:33.190> not<00:01:34.090> starting<00:01:34.540> three

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
not you know we had not starting three

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.390 
not you know we had not starting three
and<00:01:34.870> five<00:01:35.080> grip<00:01:35.380> two<00:01:35.590> rebounds<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.160> major

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
and five grip two rebounds in major

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.150 
and five grip two rebounds in major
minutes<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.120> actually<00:01:37.630> mango<00:01:38.590> didn't<00:01:38.950> grab<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
minutes and actually mango didn't grab a

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.580 
minutes and actually mango didn't grab a
defensive<00:01:39.760> rebound<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:41.200> hurts<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:41.560> a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
defensive rebound so it hurts you a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.810 
defensive rebound so it hurts you a
little<00:01:41.800> bit<00:01:41.890> when<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.070> have<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.280> rotate<00:01:42.640> so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
little bit when you have to rotate so

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.030 
little bit when you have to rotate so
much<00:01:42.970> enough<00:01:43.270> fouling<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.840> with<00:01:44.710> pressing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
much enough fouling and with pressing

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.770 
much enough fouling and with pressing
them<00:01:45.340> it's<00:01:45.550> always<00:01:45.820> tough<00:01:46.030> with<00:01:46.270> their<00:01:46.420> guards

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
it showed me tonight that Kevin's not

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.240 
it showed me tonight that Kevin's not
back<00:03:47.350> because<00:03:47.560> he<00:03:47.650> would<00:03:47.769> have<00:03:47.799> dunked<00:03:48.130> that

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
back because he would have dunked that

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.280 
back because he would have dunked that
ball<00:03:48.459> easily<00:03:49.120> he<00:03:49.329> had<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.480> wide-open<00:03:49.690> layup<00:03:50.079> so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
ball easily he had a wide-open layup so

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.140 
ball easily he had a wide-open layup so
you<00:03:50.859> know<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:50.980> don't<00:03:51.100> agree<00:03:51.400> with<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.760> offense

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
you know I don't agree with the offense

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.759 
you know I don't agree with the offense
because<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:52.420> think<00:03:52.480> we<00:03:52.720> missed<00:03:52.870> 10<00:03:53.140> layups<00:03:53.500> and

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
because I think we missed 10 layups and

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.440 
because I think we missed 10 layups and
anytime<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:54.640> can<00:03:54.760> get<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.090> front<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
anytime you can get to the front of the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.840 
anytime you can get to the front of the
rim<00:03:55.630> with<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.810> layup<00:03:56.079> that's<00:03:56.340> pretty<00:03:57.340> good<00:03:57.549> I

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
rim with a layup that's pretty good I

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.449 
rim with a layup that's pretty good I
think<00:03:58.420> if<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.600> put<00:03:58.750> ten<00:03:59.739> layups<00:04:00.100> into<00:04:00.340> this

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
think if you put ten layups into this

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.830 
think if you put ten layups into this
style<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.850> think<00:04:01.060> you'd<00:04:01.150> see<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.299> different<00:04:01.660> team

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
style I think you'd see a different team

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.990 
style I think you'd see a different team
so<00:04:02.079> i<00:04:02.290> don't<00:04:02.590> i<00:04:02.709> think<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.160> was<00:04:03.250> told<00:04:03.489> totally

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
so i don't i think it was told totally

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.280 
so i don't i think it was told totally
to<00:04:04.120> defense<00:04:04.450> don't<00:04:04.660> they<00:04:04.750> had<00:04:04.870> anything<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.230> do

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
to defense don't they had anything to do

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.799 
to defense don't they had anything to do
with<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.470> offense
