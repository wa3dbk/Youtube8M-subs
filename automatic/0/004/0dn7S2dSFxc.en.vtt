right<00:00:28.140> exactly<00:00:28.849> when<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.029> trained<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
right exactly when you trained for this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.110 
right exactly when you trained for this
competition<00:00:31.289> obviously<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.520> had<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> train

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
competition obviously you had to train

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
competition obviously you had to train
heavy<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.690> you've<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.110> thick

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
heavy because you've got a very thick

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
heavy because you've got a very thick
and<00:00:34.829> dense<00:00:34.920> physique<00:00:35.660> did<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.140> mind

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and dense physique did you have in mind

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
and dense physique did you have in mind
a<00:00:37.559> certain<00:00:37.710> look<00:00:38.070> when<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> were<00:00:39.149> training

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
a certain look when you were training

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
a certain look when you were training
for<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.780> show<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.379> did<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:40.980> want<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
for this show or did you just want to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
for this show or did you just want to
maximize<00:00:41.760> whatever<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.899> could

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
maximize whatever it was that you could

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.389 
maximize whatever it was that you could
possibly<00:00:43.290> build<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.070> physique

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
possibly build on your physique

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.340 
possibly build on your physique
basically<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.539> try<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> put<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.200> much

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
basically just try to put on as much

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
basically just try to put on as much
muscle<00:00:46.590> mass<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> offseason<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.030> try<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
muscle mass in the offseason and try to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
muscle mass in the offseason and try to
make<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> comparable<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.829> being<00:00:50.100> hard<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
make it comparable with being hard and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
make it comparable with being hard and
sharp<00:00:50.820> during<00:00:51.480> contest<00:00:52.050> preparation<00:00:52.649> time

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
sharp during contest preparation time

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
sharp during contest preparation time
and<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.579> putting<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> sighs<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and now putting on the sighs I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
and now putting on the sighs I
understand<00:00:55.559> includes<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.250> occasional<00:00:56.760> pizza

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.250 
understand includes an occasional pizza
once<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> while<00:00:57.539> does<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> help<00:00:57.989> put<00:00:58.140> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
once in a while does that help put on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
once in a while does that help put on
some<00:00:58.440> signs<00:00:58.680> oh<00:00:58.920> yeah<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.910> keeps<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.359> mind

very good for morale before training I
think<00:01:10.290> exactly<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> things

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
think exactly but the one of the things

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
think exactly but the one of the things
that<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.810> were<00:01:12.869> interested<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.350> seeing<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that we were interested in seeing is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
that we were interested in seeing is
that<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.240> train<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that you when you train for the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.149 
that you when you train for the
competition

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
competition

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 
competition
you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> particular<00:01:18.150> favorite<00:01:18.540> food

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
which is not typical of bodybuilders and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.520 
which is not typical of bodybuilders and
I<00:01:20.970> realize<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.420> didn't<00:01:21.659> necessarily<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:22.409> us

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
if you wouldn't mind telling us because

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.999 
if you wouldn't mind telling us because
it<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.759> unique<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.479> favorite
