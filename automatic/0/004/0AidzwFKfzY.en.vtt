really good bonus effect effect is that

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.459 
really good bonus effect effect is that
every<00:00:11.639> other<00:00:11.790> basic<00:00:12.300> attack<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.870> trigger<00:00:13.110> on

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
every other basic attack will trigger on

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.220 
every other basic attack will trigger on
it<00:00:13.500> effects<00:00:14.219> twice<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:15.210> example<00:00:15.780> if<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.199> have

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it effects twice for example if you have

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.460 
it effects twice for example if you have
it<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.710> vein<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.730> valor<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> 30<00:00:19.020> stacks

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
it on vein and the valor is a 30 stacks

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
it on vein and the valor is a 30 stacks
your<00:00:19.890> repiy<00:00:20.279> acid<00:00:20.640> will<00:00:20.789> activate<00:00:21.300> every

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
your repiy acid will activate every

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.840 
your repiy acid will activate every
second<00:00:22.140> attack<00:00:22.500> instead<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.220> every<00:00:23.580> third

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
second attack instead of every third

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210 
second attack instead of every third
attack<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.260> item<00:00:25.680> might<00:00:25.949> even

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
attack so I think this item might even

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.060 
attack so I think this item might even
open<00:00:26.699> more<00:00:27.090> champions<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.900> jungle<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.500> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
open more champions for jungle and I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.669
