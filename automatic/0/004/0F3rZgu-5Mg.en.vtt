00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.270
 long been led but clearly knew 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.600
 to wake up to overcome him 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.370
 baby 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 the asm evolving without its internationals 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.570
 mobilized for the tournament in the image of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.549
 camille lopez makes up for the opening by 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 mike delany the neo zelander turns on the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.920
 first strand of the match behind 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.810

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 converted by its opening half 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.080
 the Auvergnats also show a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.730
 discipline like here in melee where clement 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 Ric is punished for losing his 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.480

 lionel beauis replica to his vis-à-vis 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.090
 clermont is trying to send sequences 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 but like and a lot of clumsiness 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 bordeaux-bègles recovers a lot of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
 balloons on in-front clermont all 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.620
 like here with a good counter-touch 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 of the game with his baby 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.809
 of his recovery balloons and tent 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 to dismiss them 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.340
 with in addition a bit of success you have 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 balls to whom all at the foot attention 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 to pentagon under pressure series but 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 fertile and burgundy feeds on 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 faults Clermont 1 against in touch 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.809

 in top 14 with a test even in 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.870
 inferiority following the yellow card of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 botha him baby is holding up the shock and that's 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.129
 take the points with a drop of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.990
 first beauties 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.719
 then a mammoth penalty 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.130
 registered over 55 meters by beyer 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.119
 which was also the first 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.979
 with the Girondin jersey 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.780
 but eventually clermont ended up 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.159
 raise your level of play with 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.009
 sequences that sweeps all the terrain 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.270
 bordeaux bègles is at the breaker 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.979
 it's a hard time for the benches 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.630
 data that seem to be breaking point 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.630
 with a new attempt 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.760
 like 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.110
 symbolizes the dream what an alarm clock that 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.550
 hurts with no less than three 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.650
 Bordeaux defenders on the buttocks 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.270
 clermont takes over the hand james brock 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 enters the place of del annie even passes 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.150
 two penalties for taking him out of the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.890
 defensive bonus 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.500
 bordeaux missing points by 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.780
 beauties is here br clearly it puts me 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.940
 31-23 and takes alone the orders of the top 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.590
 14 for bordeaux begles it is a 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.550
 defeat at zero point seriously blow of 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.890
