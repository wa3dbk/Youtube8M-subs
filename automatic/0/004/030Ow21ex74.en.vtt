00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.439
 Many people ask me 

00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:05.701
 How to arrange music on the guitar 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.940
 Today I will explain how to do it. 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.900
 First write the melody 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.420
 The example I use is C major. 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.220
 Most of the songs, beginning and ending chords 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.240
 Are "main chords" 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.880
 In this example is the C chord 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 a chord before the end 

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:38.641
 Usually "genus chords" 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.960
 That is the fifth chord of the tone. 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.680
 In this case is the G chord 

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:51.383
 Now we have successfully found three chords 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.820
 Most melody can be matched with "main chords" or "chords" 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.620
 This is good news 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.080
 Because it makes the introduction of the arranger simple 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.260
 The composition of the main chord is 1, 3, 5 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.400
 The composition of the chords is 5, 7, and 2. 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.920
 Choose the right chord for each measure 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.260
 We usually turn chords at the beginning of each section. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.640
 The next step is to fill in the bass 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.800
 Generally speaking, the bass of the chord is correct. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.280
 For example, the C chord is the C bass. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.300
 The G chord is the G bass. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.520
 And so on 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.820
 Now listen to the finished product. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 Simpler, I only play melody and bass. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.620
 When your skills are better, you can add other sounds. 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.760
 Ok, now go pick a music you like. 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.503
 Try a simple arrangement 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.960
 Have Fun ;)
