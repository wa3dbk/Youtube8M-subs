00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.390
 mediatek one of the world's leading 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.700
 chipset developers for smartphones and 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.450
 Internet tablets and devices 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.780
 of things 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.780
 sponsor reporting by mobile has an w7 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.109
 hello friends and andrew nightingales we 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.870
 in barcelona mobile congress 2015 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.449
 the year is a small and cozy stand 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.430
 companies asustek where us first 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.840
 all interested in new smartphones 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.360
 zenfone 2 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.790
 either devices got the screen with 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.730
 diagonal of 5 and a half inches only 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.199
 a little different stuffing model 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.269
 z550i are called z not 551 m. 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.860
 let's start with the fact that all the taps of these 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.159
 devices despite the same 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.769
 diagonal differ resolution and on 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:05.439
 yours so to speak 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.560
 used hd resolution 720p 1280 on 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.689
 720 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 if you do not take into account not very 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.400
 high detail is used 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 here is a very high - quality ips-matrix with 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 brilliant brightness 4 will be covered up 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.810
 this screen is gorilla glass 3 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.970
 generations now we are talking about 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 the designs of which she zenfone 2 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.900
 fundamentally different body has 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.270
 rounded shape 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.579
 and the thickness of 10 millimeters in the center 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 tapers to about four millimeters 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.069
 along the edges of the design of controls 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.390
 very much like that year 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.429
 company and loggia 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.590
 but probably not to asus 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.479
 reproached plagiarism here under 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.700
 the main camera lens is located 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.770
 just swinging the volume and button 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.159
 Inclusion is located in the center of the upper 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.630
 panels 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.060
 the decision is in my opinion enough 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.909
 controversial because given the long 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.920
 cases of 152 millimeters every time 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.530
 stretch to the power button on the top 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.959
 the end is not so convenient nail 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.469
 programs is the processor on which 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.450
 does this device work the thing is that 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.400
 550 younger model is already in use 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.379
 64-bit quad core intel atom z 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.099
 3530 operating at frequency 1 and 3 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.280
 gigahertz 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.730
 besides this, atom z will be available 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.700
 35-60 whose frequency is already 1 and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 8 gigahertz both have graphics 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.209
 power vr 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.739
 the sixth generation depending on 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.200
 version will be the difference and the amount of operational 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.220
 memory can be either one gigabyte 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.519
 either 2 permanent three options 8 16 and 32 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.680
 also nice that the cover here is removable and 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.660
 there is a card slot under it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.920
 micro sd 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.620
 devices will support the installation of two 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.950
 SIM cards and lte network supported 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.319
 and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.410
 and the built-in battery has a capacity of 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.269
 3000 milliampere hours on used 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.370
 here I offer cameras to become 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.090
 a little late because there is 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.810
 what to show and now we turn 551 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.560
 models 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.870
 here is this model of the back 551 MK toraya 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.300
 external looks almost the same but 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.520
 the filling is quite serious 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.500
 with the same diagonal here used 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.950
 already in full hd resolution with density 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.040
 403 points on the 1st play the matrix is ​​the same 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.760
 the most bright 4 will become and glass gorilla 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.800
 glass 3 generations on 551 models too 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.200
 two types of processors are used and 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.959
 if so you can put it younger for 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 she is senior to the previous one 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.299
 Models it is 35-60 working at frequency 1 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.220
 and 8 gigahertz 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.799
 in this configuration the number 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.670
 RAM memory relies 2 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.549
 gigabyte 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.510
 but asus is still quite flagship 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:55.030
 version it uses intel atom z 3580 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.900
 which is already running at frequency 2 and 3 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.690
 nivea hertz 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.910
 And here with this processor goes already four 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.410
 gigabytes of ram and yet 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.569
 I have not seen a single smartphone 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.460
 which would carry so much RAM on 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.710
 board 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.590
 This model is also able to take 2 sim 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.700
 maps and of course there is lte support 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.350
 and the battery capacity is the same as 550 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.240
 makes 3000 milliampere hours and 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.400
 by the way the battery is rotten dark 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.440
 lithium polymer wireless modules and 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.690
 there and there are seen see 3 ranges 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.450
 In the module Wi-Fi and bluetooth and 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.770
 combined gps glonass true older 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.080
 model 551 still relies and nfc and now 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.340
 let's talk about cameras front has 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.770
 5 megapixel resolution aperture 2.0 and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.780
 85 degrees wide enough angle 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.790
 very good for selfies 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.370
 rear camera can not boast 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.370
 super high resolution she is here 13 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.780
 megapixels but there is a two-color 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.570
 LED flash 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.300
 as well as proprietary technology asus pixel 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.700
 master in the company itself say that this 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.740
 the sensor can take four times 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.960
 more light than ordinary sensor 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.940
 smartphone and for demonstration here 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.640
 installed even special god seki in 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.590
 which is worth a new zenfone 2 and here 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.810
 invited to put your own 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.030
 a smartphone that I actually now 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.840
 will do and as an experimental will 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.980
 none other than sony xperia z3 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.900
 despite the fact that the picture is in 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.560
 viewfinder do not differ high 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.639
 quality 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.689
 if we shoot 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.689
 this is the final version 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.070
 will be fundamentally different in general 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.430
 the focus in the chamber is on working out 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.810
 automatic modes are therefore always on 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.330
 the screen is on fire 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.090
 auto but as soon as the camera determines what 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.550
 you can change the scene for example filming 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.200
 poor lighting conditions and either hdr 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.030
 how in this case lights up 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.550
 corresponding icon and suggested 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.710
 users select the desired option and 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.170
 despite the fact that asus says that 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.590
 use sensors from their devices 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.360
 sony 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.270
 I don't know why, but the result is here. 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.340
 it turns out more interesting everything is possible 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.980
 it's just fine tuning and software 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.530
 settings new zenfone is already working 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.170
 running android 50 lollipop 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.540
 there are convenient icons with large 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.250
 switching icons of various functions 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.350
 as a software shell 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.810
 the proprietary ground interface is used 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.210
 oh and in the settings there is even a special 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.000
 item to update items only 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.640
 fill the whole interface of course very 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.950
 fast and the shell just flies though 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.020
 nothing else from such a processor and 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.960
 this amount of RAM, of course, I and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.930
 did not expect it remains to add that line 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.330
 zenfone 2 is perceived by asus as more 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.850
 higher compared to the first and zenfone 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.120
 it means that the price is likely to be 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.770
 taller though the developers assure us 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.110
 that will do everything possible 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.740
 to stay exactly within 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.450
 no high price gadgets on this today 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.100
 all i thank you for watching 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.100
 Mobile X-bye
