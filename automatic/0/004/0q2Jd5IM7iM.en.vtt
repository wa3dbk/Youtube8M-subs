um say the proto pads and the die pads

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.570 
um say the proto pads and the die pads
they're<00:02:40.260> both<00:02:40.410> more<00:02:40.800> expensive<00:02:41.250> than<00:02:41.370> these

are<00:02:41.820> eclipsed<00:02:42.330> pads<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:44.150> if<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.360> actually<00:02:45.540> go

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
are eclipsed pads and if I actually go

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.470 
are eclipsed pads and if I actually go
and<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.560> more<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.890> features<00:02:47.480> but

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and look at more of the features but

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.570 
and look at more of the features but
it's<00:02:48.930> paden<00:02:49.380> goes<00:02:49.740> all<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.040> way<00:02:50.220> up<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.340> your

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
it's paden goes all the way up to your

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
elbow so you can see where it bends here

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.680 
elbow so you can see where it bends here
this<00:02:53.100> will<00:02:53.280> protect<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.670> elbow<00:02:54.060> most<00:02:54.390> pads

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
about this on the spa probably give it

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.100 
about this on the spa probably give it
an<00:04:25.650> eight<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:27.180> die<00:04:27.330> pads<00:04:27.660> would<00:04:27.780> probably

an eight the die pads would probably

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.779 
an eight the die pads would probably

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
be about the same rating because

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.790 
be about the same rating because
although<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.389> die<00:04:30.629> pads<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.469> might<00:04:31.650> be<00:04:31.770> a
