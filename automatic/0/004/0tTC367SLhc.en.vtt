00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
challenge to try and stop them in pickup

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.390 
challenge to try and stop them in pickup
and<00:01:58.250> burn<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.490> senior<00:01:59.850> at<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.060> time<00:02:01.130> just<00:02:02.130> he

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
and burn the senior at the time just he

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.100 
and burn the senior at the time just he
would<00:02:02.550> talk<00:02:02.730> about<00:02:02.760> me<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.300> say<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.660> had

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
would talk about me and say that I had

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.110 
would talk about me and say that I had
clamps<00:02:04.590> how<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:04.890> lock<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.820> defense

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
clamps how I would lock up on defense

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.780 
clamps how I would lock up on defense
and<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.260> became<00:02:07.580> my<00:02:08.580> identity

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
and so that kind of became my identity

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.120 
and so that kind of became my identity
throughout<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> team<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.500> carried<00:02:11.100> that
