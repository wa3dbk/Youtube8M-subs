00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
so the two shapes we're going to use our

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.810 
so the two shapes we're going to use our
circle<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.989> horizontal<00:00:44.580> figure<00:00:45.580> eight

circle and a horizontal figure eight
going<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.870> back<00:00:47.019> so<00:00:47.350> let's<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.100> clarify

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400

going to the back so let's just clarify
what<00:00:48.790> i<00:00:48.820> mean<00:00:49.059> by<00:00:49.210> these<00:00:49.360> two<00:00:49.570> things<00:00:49.780> so

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
what i mean by these two things so

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.590 
what i mean by these two things so
starting<00:00:51.010> your<00:00:51.280> basic<00:00:51.580> dance<00:00:51.820> posture<00:00:52.360> we're

starting your basic dance posture we're
just<00:00:52.720> going<00:00:52.900> to<00:00:53.019> use<00:00:53.199> a<00:00:53.409> flat<00:00:53.830> exterior<00:00:54.820> hip

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
just going to use a flat exterior hip

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.790 
just going to use a flat exterior hip
circles<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:55.900> I'm<00:00:56.050> going<00:00:56.110> straight<00:00:56.409> out<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.769> the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
circles so I'm going straight out to the

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.130 
circles so I'm going straight out to the
side<00:00:56.920> I'm<00:00:57.489> going<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.760> go<00:00:57.879> around<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:58.930> front

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
side I'm going to go around to the front

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.829 
side I'm going to go around to the front
up<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.250> other<00:01:00.430> side<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.089> then<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.720> the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
up to the other side and then to the

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.350 
up to the other side and then to the
back<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.320> then<00:01:02.920> out<00:01:03.250> back<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.000> side<00:01:04.210> I've

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
back and then out back to the side I've

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.719 
back and then out back to the side I've
started<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.870> so<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:05.950> can<00:01:06.159> be<00:01:06.190> kind<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.640> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
started on so this can be kind of a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.850 
started on so this can be kind of a
larger<00:01:07.450> side<00:01:07.930> for<00:01:08.380> something<00:01:08.710> like<00:01:08.799> this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
larger side for something like this

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.530 
larger side for something like this
especially<00:01:09.159> if<00:01:09.610> you're<00:01:09.700> using<00:01:09.729> before<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.270> top

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
especially if you're using before a top

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.450 
especially if you're using before a top
seen<00:01:10.810> maybe<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.290> want<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.560> make<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.010> little

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
seen maybe you want to make it a little

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.090 
seen maybe you want to make it a little
bigger<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.240> more<00:01:13.450> expressive<00:01:13.899> going<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:14.979> the

other way little bit of upper body lean
with<00:01:18.430> dead<00:01:18.640> depending<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.329> what<00:01:19.420> your<00:01:19.570> music

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
is telling you so as far as the figure

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.149 
is telling you so as far as the figure
eight<00:01:22.869> those<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.560> figure-eight<00:01:24.130> that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
eight those this is a figure-eight that

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.279 
eight those this is a figure-eight that
is<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.670> horizontal<00:01:25.030> figure<00:01:25.719> eight<00:01:25.899> meaning

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
is the horizontal figure eight meaning

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.849 
is the horizontal figure eight meaning
that<00:01:26.469> it's<00:01:26.710> all<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.219> this<00:01:27.640> plane<00:01:28.329> here<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.469> when

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
that it's all on this plane here so when

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.010 
that it's all on this plane here so when
I<00:01:29.890> say<00:01:30.250> figure<00:01:30.579> e<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.909> back<00:01:31.240> what<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.630> mean

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
I say figure e to the back what I mean

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.020 
I say figure e to the back what I mean
is<00:01:32.259> that<00:01:32.289> when<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.680> take<00:01:32.890> my<00:01:32.920> gifts<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.789> take

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the curve to the front and then come

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.429 
the curve to the front and then come
through<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.000> middle<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.259> other

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
through the middle and that to the other

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.639 
through the middle and that to the other
side<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.600> I'm<00:01:46.899> saying<00:01:47.350> when<00:01:47.619> I

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
side so this is what I'm saying when I

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.190 
side so this is what I'm saying when I
say<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.219> horizontal<00:01:49.090> figure<00:01:49.450> eight<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
say a horizontal figure eight to the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.499 
say a horizontal figure eight to the
back<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.710> course<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.490> or<00:01:51.729> your<00:01:51.880> instructor

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
back of course you or your instructor

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.990 
back of course you or your instructor
may<00:01:52.539> call<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.020> differently

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
may call it differently

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.080 
may call it differently
just<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> clarify<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.230> what<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.470> mean<00:01:56.090> now

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
just to clarify this is what I mean now

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.920 
just to clarify this is what I mean now
we're<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> put<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.720> two<00:01:57.900> things

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
we're going to put those two things

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
we're going to put those two things
together<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.700> about<00:01:59.910> how

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
together now you have to think about how

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
together now you have to think about how
these<00:02:00.780> two<00:02:01.050> shapes<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.010> overlay<00:02:02.550> them

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
these two shapes if you overlay them

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420 
these two shapes if you overlay them
where<00:02:03.270> they<00:02:03.540> would<00:02:03.750> line<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:05.190> these

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
where they would line up and on these

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.250 
where they would line up and on these
two<00:02:05.670> shapes<00:02:05.910> they<00:02:06.300> are<00:02:06.479> both<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
two shapes they are both on this

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.109 
two shapes they are both on this
horizontal<00:02:07.890> plane<00:02:08.100> here<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.000> place

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
horizontal plane here and the place

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.240 
horizontal plane here and the place
where<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:10.140> come<00:02:10.470> together<00:02:10.709> would<00:02:11.220> be

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
where they would come together would be

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.130 
where they would come together would be
on<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> sides<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> side<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
on the sides out here on the side of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.870 
on the sides out here on the side of
your<00:02:13.290> circle<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.400> what<00:02:14.580> I'm<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
your circle so that's what I'm going to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.300 
your circle so that's what I'm going to
do<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.480> put<00:02:15.720> these<00:02:15.900> two<00:02:16.170> together<00:02:16.380> I'll<00:02:16.830> do

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
do to put these two together I'll do

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
do to put these two together I'll do
this<00:02:17.430> based<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.970> first<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:18.570> I'm

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
this based on you first and then I'm

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.330 
this based on you first and then I'm
going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.959> go<00:02:19.080> ahead<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.290> turn<00:02:19.500> around<00:02:19.650> case

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
going to go ahead and turn around case

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.730 
going to go ahead and turn around case
any<00:02:20.580> easier<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> understand<00:02:21.959> so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
any easier for you to understand so

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.530 
any easier for you to understand so
we're<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> start<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.820> I'm<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.480> go

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
we're going to start out I'm going to go

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.330 
we're going to start out I'm going to go
out<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:25.110> right<00:02:25.350> I'm<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.070> go<00:02:26.190> across

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
out to my right I'm going to go across

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.000 
out to my right I'm going to go across
the<00:02:26.940> front<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.450> my<00:02:27.600> circle<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:28.770> left

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the front of my circle out to my left

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.400 
the front of my circle out to my left
I'm<00:02:29.400> going<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> back<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:30.810> circle

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I'm going to go to the back of my circle

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.229 
I'm going to go to the back of my circle
when<00:02:31.920> i<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.430> right<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.120> go

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
when i get to the right I'm going to go

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.170 
when i get to the right I'm going to go
slightly<00:02:33.720> past<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.620> point<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.640> side<00:02:35.880> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
slightly past the point of the side and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.410 
slightly past the point of the side and
now<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> take<00:02:37.590> my<00:02:37.800> left<00:02:38.130> hip

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
now I'm going to take my left hip

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.449 
now I'm going to take my left hip
backwards<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.720> bring<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.890> around<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.430> then

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
backwards and bring it around and then

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.949 
backwards and bring it around and then
I'm<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.239> take<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.510> right<00:02:42.720> hip

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
I'm going to take the right hip

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.870 
I'm going to take the right hip
backwards<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.709> then<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.370> left<00:02:44.580> it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
backwards and then they left it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.790 
backwards and then they left it
backwards<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.600> now<00:02:45.780> before<00:02:46.260> i<00:02:46.320> come<00:02:46.620> back

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
backwards and now before i come back

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.620 
backwards and now before i come back
around<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.310> finish<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.790> ate<00:02:48.030> any<00:02:48.300> further

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
around to finish that ate any further

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.630 
around to finish that ate any further
i'm<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.560> go<00:02:49.680> ahead<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.920> turn<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.370> into<00:02:50.489> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
i'm going to go ahead and turn it into a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.729 
i'm going to go ahead and turn it into a
circle<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.270> come<00:02:51.750> across<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.260> front<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
circle and come across the front and

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.840 
circle and come across the front and
come<00:02:53.580> back<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> left<00:02:54.780> side<00:02:55.370> from<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
come back to the left side from here a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.750 
come back to the left side from here a
head<00:02:57.150> back<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
head back on the right I had that on the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.270 
head back on the right I had that on the
left<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.510> had

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
left I had

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.970 
left I had
right<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:02.959> go<00:03:03.140> across<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.740> front

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
right and then I go across the front

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.530 
right and then I go across the front
again<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:04.970> I'll<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.480> from<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.990> back<00:03:07.540> so

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
again so I'll do this from the back so

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.949 
again so I'll do this from the back so
here<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> am<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.760> then<00:03:11.030> take<00:03:11.209> my<00:03:11.330> head<00:03:11.540> out<00:03:11.720> to

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
here I am and then take my head out to

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.040 
here I am and then take my head out to
the<00:03:11.990> right<00:03:12.700> across<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.940> front<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.660> side

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
the right across the front to the side

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.670 
the right across the front to the side
to<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.709> back<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.819> side<00:03:17.120> head<00:03:17.870> back<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
to the back to the side head back on the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.360 
to the back to the side head back on the
left<00:03:18.880> back<00:03:19.880> on<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.330> right<00:03:20.709> back<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.010> left

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
left back on the right back on the left

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.430 
left back on the right back on the left
and<00:03:22.700> they'll<00:03:22.850> turn<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.300> back<00:03:23.510> into<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.930> circle

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440
