so a couple people have asked me about

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.690 
so a couple people have asked me about
the<00:00:04.549> hydrogen<00:00:05.549> 410<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:07.200> have<00:00:08.069> now<00:00:08.280> got<00:00:08.550> it

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the hydrogen 410 to have now got it

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.839 
the hydrogen 410 to have now got it
powered<00:00:09.120> by<00:00:09.380> two<00:00:10.380> thousand<00:00:10.800> one<00:00:10.950> power<00:00:11.460> supply

from<00:00:12.500> progressive<00:00:13.500> RC<00:00:13.830> mean<00:00:14.280> well<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:15.389> see

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
from progressive RC mean well you see

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.970 
from progressive RC mean well you see
it's<00:00:15.660> got<00:00:15.780> really<00:00:15.960> good<00:00:17.630> power<00:00:18.630> leads<00:00:18.980> which

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's got really good power leads which

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.050 
it's got really good power leads which

you can put this in auto mode I you man

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.339 
you can put this in auto mode I you man
we<00:02:07.870> do<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.170> smells<00:02:08.680> good<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.340> us<00:02:09.520> again

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.229 

churches<00:02:15.219> something<00:02:15.519> like<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.790> point<00:02:16.030> for

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
churches something like that point for

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.300 
churches something like that point for
you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.979 
you
check<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.090> batteries<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.630> note<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
check your batteries that you note the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.160 
check your batteries that you note the
Syrians<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.160> what<00:02:20.310> you're<00:02:21.170> not

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
Syrians are so we know what you're not

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.250 
Syrians are so we know what you're not
Georgian<00:02:22.680> averages

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.150 

there<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.740> we've<00:02:30.860> got<00:02:30.980> these<00:02:31.100> two

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
there we go so we've got these two

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.280 
there we go so we've got these two
charges<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.850> on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
charges going on

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.410 
charges going on
you<00:02:33.290> know<00:02:33.500> 1c<00:02:33.890> rating<00:02:34.190> should<00:02:35.150> take<00:02:37.420> not

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
you know 1c rating should take not

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.940 
you know 1c rating should take not
roughly<00:02:38.720> an<00:02:38.780> hour<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.110> 5000<00:02:39.740> we<00:02:39.830> have

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
roughly an hour the 5000 we have

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.880 
roughly an hour the 5000 we have
different<00:02:40.340> hours<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.320> Sun<00:02:42.320> point<00:02:42.530> warble

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
different hours but the Sun point warble

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.510 
different hours but the Sun point warble
-<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.180> those

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.290
