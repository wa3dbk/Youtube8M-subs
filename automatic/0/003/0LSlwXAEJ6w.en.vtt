really cool colonel this elemental ex
colonel<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:14.610> hasn't<00:04:15.180> been<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.540> best<00:04:15.570> on

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
colonel it hasn't been the best on

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.330 
colonel it hasn't been the best on
battery<00:04:16.350> life<00:04:16.500> but<00:04:16.680> then<00:04:16.799> again<00:04:16.890> like<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.310> said

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
battery life but then again like I said

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.190 
battery life but then again like I said
I<00:04:17.519> have<00:04:17.820> overclock<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.359> CPU<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.019> have

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
I have overclock the CPU and I have

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.590 
I have overclock the CPU and I have
overclocked<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.830> GPU<00:04:20.459> some<00:04:21.000> really<00:04:21.479> really

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
overclocked the GPU some really really

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.570 
overclocked the GPU some really really
customizable<00:04:22.200> settings<00:04:22.620> within<00:04:23.370> that

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
customizable settings within that

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.980 
customizable settings within that
Colonel<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.120> recommend<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.660> check<00:04:24.840> that

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
Colonel so I recommend you check that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.850 
Colonel so I recommend you check that
out<00:04:25.020> as<00:04:25.169> well<00:04:25.289> I'll<00:04:25.500> even

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
out as well I'll even

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.499 
out as well I'll even
post<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.069> link<00:04:26.219> in<00:04:26.400> description<00:04:26.789> below<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
post a link in description below to the

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.420 
post a link in description below to the
elemental<00:04:27.990> x<00:04:28.169> kernel<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.620> i<00:04:28.680> definitely

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
elemental x kernel that i definitely

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.939 
elemental x kernel that i definitely
recommend<00:04:29.550> I've<00:04:29.939> been<00:04:30.090> used<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:31.319> team<00:04:31.560> 7

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
recommend I've been used to the team 7

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.469 
recommend I've been used to the team 7
kernel<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.610> was<00:04:32.759> really<00:04:33.000> great<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.330> it

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
kernel and that was really great but it

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.409 
kernel and that was really great but it
is<00:04:33.629> sort<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:33.990> lacking<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.800> lot<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.240> features

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
is sort of lacking a lot of the features

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.689 
is sort of lacking a lot of the features
that<00:04:36.599> elemental<00:04:37.050> X<00:04:37.229> comes<00:04:37.500> with<00:04:37.740> on<00:04:37.979> however

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
that elemental X comes with on however

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.670 
that elemental X comes with on however
I'd<00:04:38.969> like<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.270> think<00:04:39.539> that<00:04:39.599> I<00:04:39.719> had<00:04:40.050> actually

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
I'd like to think that I had actually

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.939 
I'd like to think that I had actually
better<00:04:41.539> battery<00:04:42.539> performance<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.259> team<00:04:43.469> 7

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
better battery performance on the team 7

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.890 
better battery performance on the team 7
colonel<00:04:44.490> even<00:04:45.180> though<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.360> was<00:04:45.449> overclocked

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
colonel even though it was overclocked

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.050 
colonel even though it was overclocked
to<00:04:45.960> about<00:04:46.169> 1900<00:04:46.800> megahertz<00:04:46.949> anyways<00:04:47.909> guys

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
to about 1900 megahertz anyways guys

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.059 
to about 1900 megahertz anyways guys
that's<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.750> thanks<00:04:49.110> so<00:04:49.229> much<00:04:49.409> for<00:04:49.620> watching<00:04:49.650> as
