00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.900 

it's<00:00:18.810> certainly<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> goal<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.859> qualify<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's certainly a goal to qualify and and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
it's certainly a goal to qualify and and
that's<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.600> them<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.560> big<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.430> us

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that's one of them it's a big one for us

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.340 
that's one of them it's a big one for us
is<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> continue<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.300> develop<00:00:24.539> these<00:00:25.050> players

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
is to continue to develop these players

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.000 
is to continue to develop these players
I<00:00:26.180> think<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> decent<00:00:27.750> job<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
I think we do a decent job of that and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.759 
I think we do a decent job of that and
no<00:00:29.220> question<00:00:29.670> part<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.900> finding<00:00:31.320> ways

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
no question part of it is finding ways

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.610 
no question part of it is finding ways
to<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:32.250> effective<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> win<00:00:33.239> games<00:00:33.620> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to be effective in to win games I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.290 
to be effective in to win games I
wouldn't<00:00:35.130> say<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.670> end<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.270> all

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
wouldn't say that's the end all be all

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
wouldn't say that's the end all be all
but<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.050> anytime<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.610> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
but you know anytime that you can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240 
but you know anytime that you can
achieve<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.629> goal<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.930> hopefully<00:00:40.920> trying

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
achieve that goal and hopefully trying

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.639

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to do it the right way that's that's the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
to do it the right way that's that's the

with<00:00:51.090> MLS<00:00:51.570> teams<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.050> feel<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.129> create

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
with MLS teams I feel like if we create

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
with MLS teams I feel like if we create
that<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> club<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:55.140> environment<00:00:55.680> and

a good setting kids want to come and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
a good setting kids want to come and
they<00:00:59.579> look<00:01:00.149> forward<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.079> next<00:01:01.620> week

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
which is the next training or to the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.679 
which is the next training or to the
next<00:01:03.270> event<00:01:04.700> no<00:01:05.700> question<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.270> long<00:01:06.510> but

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
next event no question it's long but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840 
next event no question it's long but
that's<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.409> football<00:01:07.590> requires<00:01:08.430> and

toughest
toughest<00:02:12.370> challenge<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.090> think<00:02:13.300> that's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
toughest challenge I think that's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.589 
toughest challenge I think that's
something<00:02:14.530> that's<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:16.090> cool<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.480> we're

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
something that's really cool that we're

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.600 
something that's really cool that we're
able<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.930> play<00:02:17.739> at<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.980> level<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.430> play

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
able to play at that level and play

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.370 
able to play at that level and play
against<00:02:18.849> those<00:02:19.060> kids<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.200> type<00:02:20.349> of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
against those kids and that type of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.290 
against those kids and that type of
talent<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.890> still<00:02:21.099> come<00:02:21.310> out<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.550> top<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.940> think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
talent and still come out on top I think

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.150 
talent and still come out on top I think
that<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.780> ultimately<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> best<00:02:23.890> thing<00:02:24.130> for

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
that it's ultimately the best thing for

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.460 
that it's ultimately the best thing for
our<00:02:24.370> players<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:25.599> get<00:02:25.840> gaming<00:02:26.349> and
