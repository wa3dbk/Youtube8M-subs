portion you can still see that the
pattern<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.500> patina<00:02:22.830> what<00:02:23.070> was<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.520> right

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
pattern of patina what was there right

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.170 
pattern of patina what was there right
but<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:24.990> actually<00:02:25.850> embedded<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
but that's actually embedded in the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.090 
but that's actually embedded in the
metal<00:02:27.480> itself<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:28.890> that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
metal itself it's like you can see that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.240 
metal itself it's like you can see that
those<00:02:29.820> acids<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:31.170> actually<00:02:31.650> etch<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
those acids they actually etch the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.910 
those acids they actually etch the
pattern<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.209> metal<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.930> know<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.709> not

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
pattern in the metal you know that's not

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.280 
pattern in the metal you know that's not
color<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.820> see<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.390> pattern<00:02:36.810> that's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
color what you see the pattern that's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.830 
color what you see the pattern that's
actually<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.070> 3d<00:02:38.820> kind<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
actually like 3d kind of like you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.350 
actually like 3d kind of like you
wouldn't<00:02:40.170> imagine<00:02:40.470> CNC<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.520> into<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> metal

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
wouldn't imagine CNC it into the metal

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.010 
wouldn't imagine CNC it into the metal
which<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.350> little<00:02:43.590> microscopic

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
which is with little microscopic

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.720 
which is with little microscopic
dimensions<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.890> what<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.520> see

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
dimensions but that's what it is you see

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.949 
dimensions but that's what it is you see
there<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.830> look<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.520> not<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.959> color

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
there if you look it's not the color

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.190 
there if you look it's not the color
differences<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.739> actually<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.520> see<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.000> h<00:02:54.480> in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
differences is actually you see it h in

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.430 
differences is actually you see it h in
the<00:02:55.350> metal<00:02:55.620> which<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.040> pretty<00:02:56.400> cool<00:02:57.290> see<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
the metal which is pretty cool see the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520 
the metal which is pretty cool see the
mirror<00:02:58.680> polish<00:02:59.160> but<00:03:00.090> still<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.630> pattern<00:03:01.380> in

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
mirror polish but still the pattern in

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.250 
mirror polish but still the pattern in
there<00:03:01.739> really<00:03:02.730> liked<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.180> very<00:03:03.480> happy<00:03:04.140> with

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
there really liked it very happy with

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.320 
there really liked it very happy with
this<00:03:04.380> one<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.770> was<00:03:04.890> again<00:03:05.190> funny<00:03:05.520> project<00:03:06.090> I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
have one more ready to go that one will

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.920 
have one more ready to go that one will
be<00:03:09.630> probably<00:03:10.110> g10<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:12.450> really<00:03:12.690> like<00:03:12.810> this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
be probably g10 and I really like this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.170 
be probably g10 and I really like this
the<00:03:13.350> waist<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:13.980> next<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.880> nothing

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
the waist really next to nothing
