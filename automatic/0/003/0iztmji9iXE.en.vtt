00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
a little bit so that you know you can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880 
a little bit so that you know you can
achieve<00:02:09.119> balance<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:09.959> easily<00:02:10.289> when<00:02:10.709> you're

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
achieve balance very easily when you're

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
achieve balance very easily when you're
doing<00:02:11.160> coming<00:02:12.080> especially<00:02:13.080> at<00:02:13.379> slow<00:02:13.590> speed

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
doing coming especially at slow speed

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.759 
doing coming especially at slow speed
so<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.290> feel<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.430> very<00:02:17.200> comparable<00:02:18.200> to

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
so I feel that it is very comparable to

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.360 
so I feel that it is very comparable to
go<00:02:19.280> away<00:02:19.459> actually<00:02:19.719> the<00:02:20.719> speedy<00:02:20.959> 35<00:02:21.319> km/h<00:02:21.920> is

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
go away actually the speedy 35 km/h is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.390 
go away actually the speedy 35 km/h is
actually<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:23.000> nice<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.659> the<00:02:24.650> comfortable

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
actually just nice and the comfortable

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.899 
actually just nice and the comfortable
level<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:25.969> going<00:02:26.659> slow<00:02:27.230> speed<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.890> also<00:02:28.609> very

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
level of going slow speed is also very

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.110 
level of going slow speed is also very
very<00:02:29.269> nice<00:02:29.469> it's<00:02:30.469> not<00:02:30.620> as<00:02:30.769> stable<00:02:31.159> as<00:02:31.670> smooth

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
very nice it's not as stable as smooth

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.949 
very nice it's not as stable as smooth
as<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.780> wheel<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.519> know<00:02:34.639> if<00:02:34.939> you<00:02:35.359> are<00:02:35.659> used

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
as a wheel but you know if you are used

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.330 
as a wheel but you know if you are used
to<00:02:36.109> it<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.530> know<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:36.829> very<00:02:36.920> very

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
to it you know it's very very

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.509 
to it you know it's very very
comfortable<00:02:38.000> okay<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.290> downside<00:02:39.859> of<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.280> is

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
comfortable okay the downside of it is

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.729 
comfortable okay the downside of it is
the<00:02:41.030> wear<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.329> tear<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:42.230> know<00:02:42.319> one<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
the wear and tear you know one of the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.649 
the wear and tear you know one of the
LED<00:02:43.129> lights<00:02:43.579> of<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.000> power<00:02:44.420> indicator

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
LED lights of the power indicator

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.379 
LED lights of the power indicator
actually<00:02:45.430> support<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.639> cannot<00:02:46.939> fire<00:02:47.120> weather

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
actually support I cannot fire weather

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.399 
actually support I cannot fire weather
is<00:02:47.599> half<00:02:47.900> full<00:02:48.139> or<00:02:49.419> you're<00:02:50.419> going<00:02:50.659> to<00:02:50.900> rent<00:02:51.260> our

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
is half full or you're going to rent our

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.259 
is half full or you're going to rent our
factory<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.400> will<00:02:52.669> get<00:02:52.879> back<00:02:52.909> to<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
factory so that I will get back to the

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.879 
factory so that I will get back to the
manufacturer<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:53.810> see<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.799> be

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
manufacturer and see if you can be

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.390 
manufacturer and see if you can be
repaired<00:02:55.189> the<00:02:55.639> power<00:02:56.000> charger<00:02:56.930> cap<00:02:57.200> area<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
repaired the power charger cap area the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.879 
repaired the power charger cap area the
the<00:02:58.700> rubbery<00:02:59.299> cap<00:02:59.659> you<00:02:59.959> can<00:03:00.139> she<00:03:00.290> take<00:03:00.560> out<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
the rubbery cap you can she take out the

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.000 
the rubbery cap you can she take out the
cat<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.569> actually<00:03:02.689> lose<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.799> very

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
cat and you can actually lose it very

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.059 
cat and you can actually lose it very
easily<00:03:04.189> so<00:03:04.430> it's<00:03:05.269> not<00:03:05.389> very<00:03:05.540> optimum<00:03:05.989> most<00:03:06.950> of

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
easily so it's not very optimum most of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.399 
easily so it's not very optimum most of
the<00:03:07.189> election<00:03:08.000> cycle<00:03:08.480> I've<00:03:08.569> seen<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:08.989> the

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
the election cycle I've seen that the

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.709 
the election cycle I've seen that the
rubbery<00:03:09.709> cap<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.189> actually<00:03:10.609> attached<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.419> the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
rubbery cap is actually attached to the

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.679 
rubbery cap is actually attached to the
part<00:03:12.590> itself<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.609> you<00:03:13.849> do<00:03:13.909> not<00:03:13.939> get<00:03:14.329> lost

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
part itself so that you do not get lost

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.890 
part itself so that you do not get lost
easily<00:03:15.019> so<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.340> think<00:03:16.639> they<00:03:17.510> have<00:03:17.540> to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
easily so this I think they have to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.219 
easily so this I think they have to
resolve<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.949> the<00:03:19.040> future<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:20.150> padding<00:03:20.569> at<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
resolve in the future the padding at the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.830 
resolve in the future the padding at the
site<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.040> wind<00:03:22.459> rider<00:03:22.699> is<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.479> little<00:03:23.750> bit

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
site of the wind rider is a little bit

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.750 
site of the wind rider is a little bit
loose<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.349> flappy<00:03:24.829> right<00:03:25.010> now<00:03:25.159> because<00:03:25.519> it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
loose is flappy right now because it's

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.360 
loose is flappy right now because it's
not<00:03:25.879> stick<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.389> properly<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.979> is<00:03:28.129> not

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
not stick on properly but in it is not

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.420 
not stick on properly but in it is not
really<00:03:28.609> a<00:03:28.879> problem<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.629> me<00:03:29.750> uh<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.530> don't<00:03:31.129> really

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
really a problem to me uh I don't really

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.399 
really a problem to me uh I don't really
touch<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.120> much<00:03:32.359> so<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:33.019> can<00:03:33.290> easily

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
touch it that much so I can easily

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.250 
touch it that much so I can easily
double<00:03:33.829> take<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.370> or<00:03:34.579> grew<00:03:34.819> it<00:03:34.939> myself<00:03:35.019> no<00:03:36.019> do

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
double take it or grew it myself no do

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.189 
double take it or grew it myself no do
it<00:03:36.290> back<00:03:36.620> myself<00:03:36.889> if<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.519> want<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:38.019> as<00:03:39.019> I

header<00:03:56.870> bar<00:03:57.109> so<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:58.009> is<00:03:58.370> very<00:03:58.549> very

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
header bar so it is very very

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.879 
header bar so it is very very
comfortable<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.900> don't<00:04:00.079> do<00:04:00.500> not<00:04:00.680> need<00:04:00.859> to

actually<00:04:01.159> carry<00:04:01.549> around<00:04:01.819> anymore<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:03.139> I

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
actually carry around anymore and I

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.219 
actually carry around anymore and I
could<00:04:03.500> think<00:04:03.620> about<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:04.189> wind<00:04:04.819> rider<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.509> it

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
could think about the wind rider is it
