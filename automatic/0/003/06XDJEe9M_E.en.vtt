 lockscreen the left of the camera 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.199
 activates the and spa process on the right 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.090

 view with a weather widget gallery 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.219

 google search the main one yourself 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.180
 We would like to define below 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.469
 at july launcher a homescreen the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.539
 through all installed applications 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.520
 Scroll through and none 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.940
 Whole where you just go down the top 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.219
 we scroll to this beautiful one 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.879
 beautiful effect can be seen here 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.960
 it nice surprises the addition 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.770
 you can get to the country in the country 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.929
 homescreen still carries the transitions 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.310
 there you can then on perspective 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.000
 switch as seen for example now 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.380
 was or because the box for example then 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.929
 is like a small room why a 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.929
 small cube 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.880
 I personally like that cylinder 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:30.890
 very good if that helps 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.179
 here so the homescreens wipes otherwise 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.479
 you can push through just as long 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.410
 also on the widgets reach the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.840
 Clients can scroll through here above 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.869
 you can set the homescreens then

 you look for any one out 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.060
 triplan on it and divorced on the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.160
 respective homescreen where you have them 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.170
 I would like to be back now 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.220
 next to different european countries 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.679
 you have just seen and so 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.000
 continue everything possible that there are more 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.099
 order that we can create can be seen 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.050
 here, for example, you can of course 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.420
 also rename 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.259
 just move in michael's life 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.410
 then a new one is added 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.200
 whole surface for the whole euro 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.860
 So deserve the designs here 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.239
 can choose 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 those already pre-installed in psychology 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.989
 Currently I have this text in gray 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.879
 fits perfectly with the ordered hello 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.019

 You also have to word so here 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.860
 now have new look you can see very much 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.250
 beautifully adapted to the whole widgets 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.940
 become 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.069
 the background is adjusted to the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.050
 Screen is also adapted to each 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.030
 after what you have installed now 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.410
 not me at the same time in the one on 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.870
 design then goes current design 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.750
 You can also customize the style of the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 set screen relaxation 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.970
 currently we have the left camera 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.160
 relaxed right 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.310
 we can see the boy as well 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.860
 say from which also apply 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.060
 that goes right then stock picks like that 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.329
 which is already activated 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.829
 the guests off and again others have 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.060
 now a lock screen where to get the 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.989
 Camera, however, parts down 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.310
 relax and right the sms has eg one 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.620
 Of course, everything about the designs is possible 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.500
 others like the background of the screen 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.569
 can especially background on paper poses 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.760
 set the symbols etc everything 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.410
 Address really has everything possible 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.019
 really nice also really reminds a lot 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.310
 strong bioly what our not disturbing 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.620
 it makes a difference in any case 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.209
 so much to the designs will have now 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.859
 we also had the above up here 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.660
 We will refill the crown here 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.850
 there is the notification card for 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.220
 do not scroll insult 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.859
 statement energy control which through 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.660
 may have suppressed adapted to more 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.920
 So you can practically anyone who still 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.500
 add more icons or 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.430
 move or the like 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.380
 we also get over the same 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.670
 point in the settings purely there 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.720
 there's a fast on general 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.329
 Overview of the main points 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.720
 font font size brightness wlan 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.030
 etc 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.459
 if you go to all you see the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.840
 all the rest of the normal menu item 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.750
 Let's start at the bottom 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.019
 over the phone we have two gigabytes 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.430
 R.A.M 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:11.420
 here can 15 cpu resolution 720 1280 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.829
 android is wrong so the whole thing is here now 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.609
 the careful story i know 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.810
 not if that is the current firmware 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.590
 stays out then comes out 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.209
 so far as well as we have a small one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.700
 fire in beside the notification 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.780
 area configures that is the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.410
 Notification makes them down 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.180
 is pulled 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.400
 keeps telling messages 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.680
 various apps that one can 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.150
 would that be about this story 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.710
 always new is the fact 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.139
 will bring even appear to 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.539
 the fire brigade is allowed to use the program 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.430
 is that the program is and so on 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.620
 display will then appear itself 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.880
 The little celebration wanted in there 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.380
 then there is a globe mode glove 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.330
 mode to turn on then that should 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.460
 display significantly more sensitive 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.340
 react 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.430
 we have what else we have one 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.630
 energy management the show as above 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.889
 arrived the battery should still hold 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.870
 I can set it to normal 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.639
 intelligent and supreme now 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.830
 difference from nine hours to four 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.479
 hours 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.160
 you can also display a time 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.910
 leave what is currently available for 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.850
 Talk for the first time under the same 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.260
 pretty pretty all that 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.789
 memory has already seen that I show 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.310
 then again I have relationships 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.580
 as a trial also sd cards with 64 gigabytes 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.340
 was no problem at all 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.320
 and again as far as they say 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.539
 device of the surface we have that 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.919
 seen the effects the folders should be 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.440
 have been if you want you can 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.639
 Once again the device looks like this 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.460
 we have the same here on the side 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.099
 two slots for micro sd and micro sim 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.470
 map loudness power button above this 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.260
 rounded rounded story the 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.840
 really really reminds of iphone 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:53.220
 on the top down here, there is one 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:57.360
 micro usb I try it not quite 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.250
 but micro usb and microphone on the 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.260
 website is just series around but it just 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.539
 as I said in advance is the device 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.070
 to find jack plug 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.990
 with this look you the one behind it 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.639
 Hidden is on one side 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.710
 practically the ink plug in front of dust 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.159
 is now whether she is in with the protection 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.990
 city ​​but make the two slots on 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.550
 can 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.460
 The underside of the device is rounded 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.490
 on the back we have speakers 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.919
 and camera with led lightning on the 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.159
 front there is a 5 megapixel 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.870
 camera and we may still have to 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.190
 It's just a wonderful thing to talk about 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.159
 even if you look at it 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.080
 It is quite difficult to see here and with light 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.300
 it is still very easy to read 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.110
 this plus display definitely makes 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.280
 what's up 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:47.780
 so far from me to usc six and more 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.780
 then im promises
