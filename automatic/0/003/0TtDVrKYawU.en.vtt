00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.220
 how you want to be sure there is 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.109
 for the iphone regular updates that 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 beautiful is that apple not only always 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.980
 the latest generation with new updates 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 supplied if just the older ones 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.450
 that's why this tip applies, of course 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.520
 just for the iphone 4s iphone 4 and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 sometimes even for the iphone 3g s 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.570
 if you have an update from your iphone 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 then want to make that many 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.380
 Of you certainly about it 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 by connecting a cable and then 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 the iphone directly to your computer 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.449
 connects and then via itunes the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 update 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 but that works for some versions 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 also directly on the iphone 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 and so you only have to open once 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.500
 go settings and then goes up 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.500
 the point in general and then too 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 Software update should be a new one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.969
 update disposal is available here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 displayed as you can see here 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.960
 currently the ios version 6.0 21 of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.910
 1 50 4 megabytes available now one 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 what I would do then I recommend 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.859
 you are in the wifi because easy 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.619
 pretty much work on gsm network load 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.479
 Of course, it's pretty big 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.320
 once charging and installing click 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.430
 accept the terms and conditions 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.780
 then he says again to safety and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 to save battery power close that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.479
 iphone upload hid of updates 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 a socket 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.229
 I still have 96 percent 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.119
 That's why I do it that way 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.619
 continue 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.689
 and then it will start here 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.710
 the update of the apple servers 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.360
 download 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.520
 I have relatively fast connections 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.820
 that's why it really works 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.070
 very fast here and see the whole 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.070
 works without my big grief 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 as soon as the update is complete 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.479
 the mobile phone is downloaded 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 turn off once and the update will be 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 then you will be missing then 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.689
 probably just a bar 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.869
 and then can get the iphone then 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.219
 start up again relatively quickly 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.630
 I'll just wait and see 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.630
 to see how fast the whole thing is 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 the installation of ios 6.02 starts in 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.479
 seven seconds connect the iphone 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.530
 I can restart directly on 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.390
 click install because I longer 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.950
 wait to check again that 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.050
 update and look for if because the file 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.630
 downloaded as far as okay 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.240
 It takes a moment and then it will 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:33.209
 completely restart the iphone and that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:35.730
 update install the iphone starts 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.200
 new now and maybe now from 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.750
 Previous updates are now known 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.830
 equally likely the exact same 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.830
 see progress banks 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.600
 that's it for now is my cell phone 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.209
 ready again the latest update is 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.140
 installed and we are ready to go again 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.140
 go and try it
