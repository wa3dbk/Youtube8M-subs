00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.140
 miracle has just launched this new 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.390
 campaign called milan and iniesta 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.430
 in magazines in the USA as the magazine 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.590
 cosmos in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.410
 show the cost of the perfect that there is with 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.240
 Red lips after applying a base 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.520
 of shadow without using this shadow on 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.010
 pink pearl tone down my eyebrows 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.869
 to illuminate from this those who let 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.690
 It is also ideal to make some of 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.030
 Makeup then place the brown tone 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.279
 clear in my almond the eye to the 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.660
 nonsense and with the same brooch 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.660
 blur in the marked line 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.510
 take this shadow pearls with sparkles and 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.850
 I'll apply on the eyelid but only 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.850
 a little bit and once I'll be blurring 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 now I'm going to delineate my eyes use 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 one liquid eyeliner and another pencil 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.730
 As those who are watching I will begin to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.729
 make a thick line in between until the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.130
 outside corner and then on the animal 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.530
 I'll make another line but this time more 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.530
 thin and put the two girls together 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.550
 I 'm laughing from the bottom line the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.920
 of my eye following her to do the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.920
 karai filling the triangle that I formed 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.840
 I will be brushing my eyebrows and I will 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.409
 fill them with the click that I showed them 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.409
 at first 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.229
 i 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.040
 now I will be using a wax and a 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.170
 illuminator the wax helps you 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.020
 hairs on my eyebrows do not move 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.820
 keep in place all day 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.830
 it illuminated down below my eyebrows this ray 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.799
 we can also use it for 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.090
 illuminate in the animal to create a 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.090
 more open look 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.680
 on my cheeks I will be using this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.290
 rumor a 20 for blogs in tone 02 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.610
 and golden hands is a coral color tone 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.610
 with golden flashes 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.350
 rizzo my eyelashes and I'm applying 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.900
 a few layers of sterri men that I 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.880
 will help to give instant volume and 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.070
 throughout the day and I really like it 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.840
 because it does not run and we do not leave 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.840
 I really recommend them girls 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.080
 almost to finish delineate in my 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.330
 lips with this transparent latex that 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.000
 It is still as yet is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.880
 you can use in two ways in all 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.440
 the lips or just delineating the lips 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.200
 as I am showing it at this moment 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.260
 this will also help them not to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.260
 run from lear and also be more peace at 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.660
 apply it and finally to trico labial 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.270
 Here I show you four different shades 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.060
 the darkest are the last ones below 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.190
 here look something similar but already a 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.040
 Once on the lips, you can see the difference 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.040
 and apply the sleep tone 07 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.209
 and 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.620
 that has been all the products of Milan 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.390

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.430
