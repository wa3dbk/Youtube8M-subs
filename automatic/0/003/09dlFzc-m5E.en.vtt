to a true cause

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.200 
to a true cause
it<00:02:08.070> could<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.580> something<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.150> with

it could be something to do with

is watch you're out there watching us
we've<00:02:17.670> proven<00:02:17.940> potentially<00:02:18.450> why<00:02:18.600> not

we've proven potentially why not

we've proven potentially why not
dedicate<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.350> true<00:02:19.470> cause<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.890> should<00:02:20.070> turn

recruit<00:02:20.490> someone<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:22.560> initiatives<00:02:22.920> program

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
recruit someone the initiatives program

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.770 
recruit someone the initiatives program
so<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.580> could<00:02:23.790> be<00:02:23.820> something<00:02:24.210> from<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.570> rocks

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
so it could be something from what rocks

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.330 
so it could be something from what rocks
but<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:24.990> really<00:02:25.350> hope<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.040> really

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
but I really hope it is and I really

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.620 
but I really hope it is and I really
hope<00:02:26.460> they<00:02:26.550> don't<00:02:26.700> do<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:26.940> huge<00:02:27.270> lakes<00:02:27.510> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
hope they don't do that huge lakes of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.850 
hope they don't do that huge lakes of
integration<00:02:28.080> like<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> little<00:02:28.470> Easter<00:02:28.710> eggs

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
integration like the little Easter eggs

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.620 
integration like the little Easter eggs
like<00:02:28.950> little<00:02:29.250> nods<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.700> both<00:02:29.820> franchises<00:02:30.090> good

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
like little nods to both franchises good

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.790 
like little nods to both franchises good
they're<00:02:30.810> both<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> same<00:02:31.170> universe<00:02:31.620> that's

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
they're both in the same universe that's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.500 
they're both in the same universe that's
kind<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.040> cool<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.330> know

that could be kind of cool if they did

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.210 
that could be kind of cool if they did
it<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.050> way<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.740> obviously<00:02:49.830> if<00:02:50.100> they're

couple<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.950> them<00:02:56.070> now<00:02:56.190> they<00:02:56.640> want<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.910> really

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
couple of them now they want to really

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.360 
couple of them now they want to really
go<00:02:57.330> full<00:02:57.570> force<00:02:57.870> against<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.500> Abstergo<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
go full force against like Abstergo and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.070 
go full force against like Abstergo and
against<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> Templars<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.540> really<00:03:00.930> sort<00:03:01.050> of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
against the Templars and really sort of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900 
against the Templars and really sort of
take<00:03:01.260> them<00:03:01.470> head-on<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.400> I've<00:03:02.490> always<00:03:02.700> said

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
take them head-on so I've always said

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.010 
take them head-on so I've always said
this<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.330> initiative<00:03:03.690> program<00:03:03.900> is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
this is what the initiative program is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.180 
this is what the initiative program is
if<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.140> don't<00:03:04.260> know<00:03:04.320> what<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:05.040> like

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
if you don't know what it is it's like

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
if you don't know what it is it's like
if<00:03:05.280> remember<00:03:05.490> back<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.670> Brotherhood<00:03:06.060> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
if remember back in Brotherhood and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.810 
if remember back in Brotherhood and
revelations<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.650> well<00:03:07.830> when<00:03:08.220> Abstergo<00:03:08.700> was

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
revelations as well when Abstergo was

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.880 
revelations as well when Abstergo was
training<00:03:09.180> their<00:03:09.270> operatives<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.320> very

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
training their operatives it's very

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.410 
training their operatives it's very
similar<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.790> assassins<00:03:12.300> are

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
similar to that but the assassins are

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.880 
similar to that but the assassins are
doing<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:12.840> using<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> animus<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> train

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
doing and now using the animus to train

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.970 
doing and now using the animus to train
people<00:03:14.070> train<00:03:14.580> their<00:03:14.610> initiates<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:16.709> fight

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
people train their initiates to fight

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.280 
people train their initiates to fight
against<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> Templars<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.230> is

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
against the Templars so this this is

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.449 
against the Templars so this this is
most<00:03:19.860> likely<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.180> mostly<00:03:22.170> about<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
most likely now like mostly about the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.100 
most likely now like mostly about the
assassins<00:03:23.940> versus<00:03:24.239> temple<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.630> think<00:03:24.840> Juno

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
assassins versus temple I think Juno

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.170 
assassins versus temple I think Juno
obviously<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> big<00:03:25.650> part<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.130> still<00:03:26.220> but

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
obviously is a big part of it still but

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.759 
obviously is a big part of it still but
the<00:03:27.420> Assassin's<00:03:27.900> versus<00:03:28.200> template<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.560> very

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the Assassin's versus template is very

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.259 
the Assassin's versus template is very
prominent<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.459> game<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> think<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
prominent in this game I think for the

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.570 
prominent in this game I think for the
modern<00:03:30.510> day<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> historical<00:03:32.190> aspect

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
modern day and for the historical aspect

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.030 
modern day and for the historical aspect
so<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.630> seems<00:03:34.140> really<00:03:34.350> really<00:03:34.530> cool

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
so that seems really really cool

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.830 
so that seems really really cool
so<00:03:35.430> maybe<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.150> modern<00:03:36.480> day<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:38.660> I'm<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.780> sure

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
so maybe the modern day is I'm not sure

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.870 
so maybe the modern day is I'm not sure
because<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.160> interviews<00:03:41.489> Alex<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.790> one

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
because in the interviews Alex and one

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.570 
because in the interviews Alex and one
CEO<00:03:42.060> he<00:03:42.209> did<00:03:42.390> actually<00:03:42.540> say<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.830> are<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
CEO he did actually say that you are the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.280 
CEO he did actually say that you are the
like<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.480> main<00:03:45.660> character<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.080> modern

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
like the main character in the modern

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.310 
like the main character in the modern
day<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.660> protagonist<00:03:48.959> not

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
day so not not you the protagonist not

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.400 
day so not not you the protagonist not
you<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:50.000> Abstergo<00:03:51.000> employee<00:03:51.330> literally<00:03:52.080> you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
you the Abstergo employee literally you

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.009 
you the Abstergo employee literally you
playing<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.100> game<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:54.030> does<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.300> mean<00:03:54.630> the

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
playing the game so does that mean the

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.540 
playing the game so does that mean the
we're<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:55.500> gonna<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.860> modern<00:03:56.160> day<00:03:56.310> part

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
we're not gonna have a modern day part

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.710 
we're not gonna have a modern day part
of<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.730> game<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:57.300> we're<00:03:57.390> gonna<00:03:57.450> have<00:03:57.600> to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
of the game and what we're gonna have to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.540 
of the game and what we're gonna have to
do<00:03:57.870> instead<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.530> find<00:03:58.920> things<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
do instead is just find things in the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.270 
do instead is just find things in the
Animas<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.870> us<00:04:01.110> as<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.590> we're<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.860> person

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
Animas for us as if we're the person

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.560 
Animas for us as if we're the person
using<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.550> animus<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.880> find<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> glyphs<00:04:03.420> and

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
using the animus I find the glyphs and

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.699 
using the animus I find the glyphs and
things<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.230> literally<00:04:04.440> can't

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
things like that so we literally can't

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.890 
things like that so we literally can't
exit<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.100> animus<00:04:05.400> or<00:04:05.489> what<00:04:06.360> does<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.570> mean

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
exit the animus or what does that mean

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.949 
exit the animus or what does that mean
like<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.290> don't<00:04:07.709> know<00:04:07.920> because<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.959> don't

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
like I don't know because I don't

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.449 
like I don't know because I don't
