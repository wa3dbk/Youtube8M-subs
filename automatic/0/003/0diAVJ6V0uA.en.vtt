hectic and some hard racing I think with

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.370 
hectic and some hard racing I think with
the<00:02:19.800> double-file<00:02:20.250> restarts<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.380> I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
the double-file restarts and so on so I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.770 
the double-file restarts and so on so I
think<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> fans<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.850> guess<00:02:24.060> most<00:02:24.630> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
think all the fans and I guess most of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.920 
think all the fans and I guess most of
drivers<00:02:25.110> are<00:02:25.200> looking<00:02:25.410> forward<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.769> it
