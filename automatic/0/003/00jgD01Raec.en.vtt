00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
over yes those are really my pictures

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.740 
over yes those are really my pictures
that's<00:03:32.030> incredible

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
that's incredible

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.200 
that's incredible
I<00:03:33.840> had<00:03:34.200> no<00:03:34.500> idea<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:35.370> they<00:03:35.490> were<00:03:35.520> really<00:03:35.910> that

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
I had no idea that they were really that

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.380 
I had no idea that they were really that
that<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.690> huge<00:03:37.140> oh<00:03:37.620> wow<00:03:38.250> yeah<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.120> looks<00:03:39.270> so

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
that is huge oh wow yeah it looks so

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.270 
that is huge oh wow yeah it looks so
much<00:03:39.540> brighter<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:40.530> changes<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.250> whole

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
much brighter and then changes the whole

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.910 
much brighter and then changes the whole
chemistry<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.510> your<00:03:42.690> smile<00:03:42.990> it's<00:03:43.560> pretty

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
chemistry of your smile it's pretty

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.130 
chemistry of your smile it's pretty
impressive<00:03:44.340> i<00:03:44.730> like<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.720> before

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
impressive i like that the before

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.560
