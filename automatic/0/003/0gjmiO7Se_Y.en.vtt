ohms<00:01:41.170> which<00:01:41.500> is<00:01:42.130> good<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.210> shows<00:01:43.480> me<00:01:43.690> the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
ohms which is good so it shows me the

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.100 
ohms which is good so it shows me the
element<00:01:44.320> isn't<00:01:44.830> actually<00:01:45.130> burned<00:01:45.550> out<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.110> I'm

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
element isn't actually burned out so I'm

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
element isn't actually burned out so I'm
going<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.320> do<00:01:47.440> some<00:01:47.650> further<00:01:47.860> tests<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.860> test

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
going to do some further tests so I test

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:15.240 
going to do some further tests so I test
from<00:01:51.280> here<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:54.070> nothing<00:01:54.250> oh<00:01:55.979> yeah

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
understand I'm gonna take my black probe

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.610 
understand I'm gonna take my black probe
I'm<00:03:35.390> gonna<00:03:35.630> put<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.870> tells<00:03:39.170> me<00:03:39.350> that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
I'm gonna put here so it tells me that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.190 
I'm gonna put here so it tells me that
my<00:03:39.650> wire<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.190> good<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.209> from<00:03:41.450> hit<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.780> point

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
my wire is good so from hit this point

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
my wire is good so from hit this point
when<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:42.920> go<00:03:43.190> all<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.459> way<00:03:43.489> around<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.040> do

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
when I go all the way around and I do

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.880 
when I go all the way around and I do
this<00:03:46.489> I<00:03:46.730> get<00:03:47.060> nothing<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.900> there<00:03:48.049> should<00:03:48.709> be<00:03:48.859> a

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
this I get nothing so there should be a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.270 
this I get nothing so there should be a
four-hour<00:03:49.400> resistor<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.440> form<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.650> resistor

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
four-hour resistor a form of a resistor

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.380 
four-hour resistor a form of a resistor
R<00:03:52.519> fuse<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.209> this<00:03:53.390> line<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:55.060> think<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.209> is<00:03:56.359> a

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
R fuse in this line I think this is a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.840 
R fuse in this line I think this is a
problem<00:03:56.630> right<00:03:57.260> here<00:03:57.340> I<00:04:00.220> think<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.430> right

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
problem right here I think this right

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.550 
problem right here I think this right
here<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.420> under<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:02.930> little<00:04:03.260> lid<00:04:03.380> here

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
here in this under this little lid here

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.530 
here in this under this little lid here
the<00:04:03.950> resist<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.579> I<00:04:04.640> think<00:04:04.819> this<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.120> problem

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
the resist and I think this is a problem

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.000 
the resist and I think this is a problem
so<00:04:06.049> what<00:04:06.200> I'm<00:04:06.290> going<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.470> have<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.650> do<00:04:06.859> I'm

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
so what I'm going to have to do I'm

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.309 
so what I'm going to have to do I'm
going<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.280> have<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.459> cut<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:07.910> out<00:04:08.140> I'm<00:04:09.140> gonna

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
going to have to cut this out I'm gonna

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.140 
going to have to cut this out I'm gonna
have<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.620> cut<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:09.829> out<00:04:10.010> out<00:04:10.280> of<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.760> circuit

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
have to cut it out out of the circuit

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.890 
have to cut it out out of the circuit
and<00:04:12.190> solder<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.760> replace<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.750> wire

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
and solder it and replace the wire

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.920 
and solder it and replace the wire
inside<00:04:15.229> it<00:04:15.440> all<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.739> way<00:04:15.829> to<00:04:16.040> Chicago

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
inside it all the way to Chicago

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:25.140 
inside it all the way to Chicago
with<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.250> okay<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:23.190> we'll<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.310> back<00:04:24.520> I'll<00:04:24.940> be

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
with you okay so we'll be back I'll be

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.779 
with you okay so we'll be back I'll be
back<00:04:25.389> with<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.050> next<00:04:26.650> segment<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.610> would

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
back with a next segment so I would

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.700 
back with a next segment so I would
either<00:04:27.910> have<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.270> break<00:04:28.539> it<00:04:28.690> up<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:29.199> much<00:04:29.410> and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
either have to break it up so much and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.070 
either have to break it up so much and
so<00:04:29.740> much<00:04:30.340> segments<00:04:30.910> for<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.330> actually<00:04:31.539> get

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
so much segments for you to actually get

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080 
so much segments for you to actually get
the<00:04:32.110> whole<00:04:32.979> trouble<00:04:33.220> shooting<00:04:33.520> at<00:04:33.729> this<00:04:33.850> end

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
the whole trouble shooting at this end

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.330 
the whole trouble shooting at this end
but<00:04:34.360> as<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.080> started<00:04:35.139> to<00:04:35.470> have<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.650> camera<00:04:35.889> person

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
but as I started to have a camera person

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.010 
but as I started to have a camera person
here<00:04:36.580> now<00:04:36.759> my<00:04:37.030> sister<00:04:37.360> will<00:04:37.479> be<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.720> camera

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
here now my sister will be the camera

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.830 
here now my sister will be the camera
woman<00:04:38.169> she's<00:04:38.650> not<00:04:38.889> here<00:04:39.130> at<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.370> moment<00:04:39.840> so
