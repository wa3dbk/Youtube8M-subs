00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
thought in Belfast the idea is that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you know where in order to to get back

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
you know where in order to to get back
to<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> original<00:00:37.920> principles<00:00:38.579> that

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
to the original principles that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
to the original principles that
undergird<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:40.050> societies<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:41.250> slip<00:00:41.550> away

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
undergird our societies we slip away

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
undergird our societies we slip away
from<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.930> through<00:00:43.219> I'm

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
from that we're going to go through I'm

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.330 
from that we're going to go through I'm
afraid<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.649> deadly<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
afraid a lot of very deadly and and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310 
afraid a lot of very deadly and and
disastrous<00:00:47.969> times<00:00:48.270> before<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.110> but

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
disastrous times before we get there but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
disastrous times before we get there but
but<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
but that's all right see what we have to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
but that's all right see what we have to
understand<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> people<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> normal

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
cycle right now it's true that's a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
cycle right now it's true that's a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
normal cycle it's a normal cycle I'm so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.099

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
attention to the way in which this is

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.690 
attention to the way in which this is
done<00:05:43.110> because<00:05:43.350> if<00:05:43.920> you<00:05:44.130> think<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.460> know<00:05:44.580> the

answers you won't ask the question and
then<00:05:47.400> we<00:05:47.550> have<00:05:47.790> to<00:05:47.820> discover<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.510> subtle<00:05:49.290> and

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
then we have to discover the subtle and

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.680 
then we have to discover the subtle and
ingenious<00:05:50.070> methodologies<00:05:50.760> you<00:05:50.940> know<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:51.450> my

ingenious methodologies you know in my
work<00:05:51.870> especially<00:05:52.440> I<00:05:52.770> go<00:05:52.890> very<00:05:53.100> much<00:05:53.250> into

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
work especially I go very much into

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
showing you what is the nature of these

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.110 
showing you what is the nature of these
forces<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:56.160> control<00:05:56.340> us<00:05:56.580> because<00:05:56.850> we<00:05:56.940> can't

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
forces that control us because we can't

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.090 
forces that control us because we can't
be<00:05:57.240> free<00:05:57.510> unless<00:05:57.720> we've<00:05:57.990> intimately<00:05:58.500> aware<00:05:58.740> of

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
the kinds of psychic dictatorship that's

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.080 
the kinds of psychic dictatorship that's
being<00:06:01.470> pervade<00:06:01.860> an<00:06:02.010> arm<00:06:02.160> it<00:06:07.190> actually<00:06:08.190> they're

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
being pervade an arm it actually they're

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.470 
being pervade an arm it actually they're
the<00:06:09.450> reason<00:06:10.220> for<00:06:11.220> them<00:06:11.340> as<00:06:11.640> you<00:06:11.910> say<00:06:12.090> doing

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
the reason for them as you say doing

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.730 
the reason for them as you say doing
this<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.720> us<00:06:12.750> was<00:06:12.990> literally<00:06:13.350> to<00:06:13.470> create

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
this to us was literally to create

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.730 
this to us was literally to create
servants<00:06:14.160> to<00:06:14.790> have<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> race<00:06:15.270> of<00:06:15.570> people<00:06:15.810> that

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
servants to have a race of people that

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.890 
servants to have a race of people that
would<00:06:16.770> serve<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:17.730> know<00:06:17.850> them<00:06:18.420> because<00:06:18.630> they

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
would serve you know them because they

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.640 
would serve you know them because they
assume<00:06:19.590> one<00:06:19.770> client<00:06:20.040> ourselves<00:06:21.000> yeah<00:06:21.650> right

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
assume one client ourselves yeah right

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.590 
assume one client ourselves yeah right
you<00:06:22.800> sure<00:06:22.950> i<00:06:22.980> got<00:06:23.280> she's<00:06:23.490> go<00:06:23.640> ahead<00:06:23.760> yeah<00:06:24.360> the

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
you sure i got she's go ahead yeah the

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.630 
you sure i got she's go ahead yeah the
idea<00:06:24.930> was<00:06:25.170> that<00:06:25.200> when<00:06:25.890> you<00:06:26.010> come<00:06:26.250> here<00:06:26.520> and
