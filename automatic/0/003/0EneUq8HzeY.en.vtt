myself that this was a real thing it

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.119 
myself that this was a real thing it
felt<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.579> was<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.389> mental<00:03:39.780> exercise

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
felt like it was just a mental exercise
