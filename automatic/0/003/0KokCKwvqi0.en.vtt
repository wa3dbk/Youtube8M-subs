00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.529 
front of the sweatshirt is blue so that
is<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.770> did<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.399> used<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.819> big<00:01:41.029> paintbrush

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
is what I did I used a big paintbrush

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.739 
is what I did I used a big paintbrush
and<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:42.439> left<00:01:43.249> I<00:01:43.490> went<00:01:43.819> over<00:01:44.029> some<00:01:44.179> spots<00:01:44.509> more

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
and I left I went over some spots more

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.449 
and I left I went over some spots more
than<00:01:44.899> once<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:45.380> didn't<00:01:45.709> go<00:01:45.950> over<00:01:46.159> some<00:01:46.399> other

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
than once but didn't go over some other

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.370 
than once but didn't go over some other
spots<00:01:46.849> so<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.329> gave<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.630> illusion<00:01:47.779> of<00:01:48.079> flake

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
spots so it gave the illusion of flake

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.919 
spots so it gave the illusion of flake
clouds<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:49.369> those<00:01:49.939> were<00:01:50.119> on<00:01:50.209> Taylors<00:01:50.599> and

clouds because those were on Taylors and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.959 
clouds because those were on Taylors and
then<00:01:51.229> I<00:01:51.499> flipped<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:51.859> over<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.369> painted<00:01:52.849> the

I<00:02:04.400> searched<00:02:04.970> some<00:02:05.450> seagull<00:02:06.140> images<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:06.920> Google

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.570 
I searched some seagull images on Google
and<00:02:07.880> copy<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:08.750> pasted<00:02:09.170> them<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.650> then<00:02:10.490> I

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
and copy and pasted them and then I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.890 
and copy and pasted them and then I
printed<00:02:10.940> them<00:02:11.030> out<00:02:11.210> on<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.540> print<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
printed them out on the print and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.350 
printed them out on the print and
transfer<00:02:12.350> paper<00:02:12.620> which<00:02:13.100> was<00:02:13.370> super<00:02:13.550> easy<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
transfer paper which was super easy and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.300

then<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.590> cut<00:02:16.340> out<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.490> seagulls<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:18.190> think<00:02:19.190> I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
then I cut out the seagulls I think I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.720 
then I cut out the seagulls I think I
had<00:02:19.520> five<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:20.000> six<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.660> then<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.580> followed<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
had five or six and then I followed the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
paper to iron them on it was super

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.720 
paper to iron them on it was super
simple<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.920> think<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.250> turned<00:02:28.400> out<00:02:28.550> really

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
used this dark purple shadow just

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.890 
used this dark purple shadow just
because<00:03:51.460> it's<00:03:51.640> for<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.820> Halloween<00:03:52.270> look<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.780> I

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
because it's for a Halloween look and I

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.310 
because it's for a Halloween look and I
put<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.370> underneath<00:03:54.370> my<00:03:54.640> eyes<00:03:55.300> on<00:03:55.870> my<00:03:55.900> lower

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
put that underneath my eyes on my lower

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.230 
put that underneath my eyes on my lower
lash<00:03:56.650> line<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.340> also<00:03:57.520> put<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:57.940> on<00:03:58.060> my<00:03:58.209> upper

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
lash line and I also put it on my upper

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.840 
lash line and I also put it on my upper
lash<00:03:58.720> line<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:59.290> would<00:03:59.920> not<00:04:00.100> normally<00:04:00.310> do<00:04:00.700> this

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
lash line I would not normally do this

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.540 
lash line I would not normally do this
on<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> daily<00:04:01.420> basis<00:04:01.840> but<00:04:02.110> purple<00:04:02.980> tends<00:04:03.370> to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
on a daily basis but purple tends to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.550 
on a daily basis but purple tends to
make<00:04:03.700> blue<00:04:03.910> eyes<00:04:03.940> pop<00:04:04.090> more<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.350> thought

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
make blue eyes pop more so I thought

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.400 
make blue eyes pop more so I thought
that<00:04:05.740> was<00:04:05.860> good<00:04:06.070> for<00:04:06.280> Halloween<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.600> don't

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
that was good for Halloween and I don't

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.440 
that was good for Halloween and I don't
know<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.530> just<00:04:08.650> thought<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.130> was<00:04:09.370> fun<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.270> put

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
know I just thought it was fun so I put

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.690 
know I just thought it was fun so I put
that<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.690> my<00:04:10.720> upper<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.140> lower<00:04:11.620> lash<00:04:11.980> line<00:04:12.340> and

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
that on my upper and lower lash line and

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.420 
that on my upper and lower lash line and
I<00:04:12.940> blended<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.450> in

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.720 

so<00:04:18.430> next<00:04:19.209> we're<00:04:19.420> going<00:04:19.540> to<00:04:19.630> move<00:04:19.810> on<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.700> how<00:04:21.700> I

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
so next we're going to move on to how I

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.910 
so next we're going to move on to how I
said<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.150> did<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.870> highlight<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.890> inner

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920
