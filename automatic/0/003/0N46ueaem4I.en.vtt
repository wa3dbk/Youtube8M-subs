00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hey people i'm there again like his 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.630
 are you the emi wrote me 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.250
 or army wrote me and me 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.190
 must be a bit of a smile question 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.740
 really funny especially since you really me 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.359
 and that has something with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 to do personal hygiene and indeed wonders 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.590
 the ami like that so that's me so 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 on the camping as the showers are on 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
 campsites et cetera and if you look 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.330
 because the hair because everyone already 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.990
 but I have noticed now 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.850
 not so much the hair moves and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 I have not noticed it yet 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.430
 whether it somewhere it is not enough for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.440
 the men 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 I am probably the complete one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.420
 Wrong type at all this question 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.649
 I can not ask yet 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.360
 Signs please do not see the hair 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 However, yes, as I said that should color 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 not that you are allowed to me there 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.100
 do not know simply okay but you 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:04.920
 ask two other other questions 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:07.380
 us it was cheaper is a pain even 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.909
 not want to know if a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.460
 car is a bit cheaper a car in 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.869
 buy kernels 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 just a little tip from me 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.670
 which comes to the side kac in the lot and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.770
 just look at the cars in kerns 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.119
 costs 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.560
 this is practically an advertisement car 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.030
 showport what you are in cairns and what 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.080
 cost them in sidney and there you can 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 make yourself a very good picture 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.579
 what the cost differences are for me 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.710
 do not quite know what they are for 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.960
 Buy car or would like to have is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.960
 etc is certainly seasonal 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.979
 depending but as I said on castro 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.500
 and then it can be very fast 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.649
 find out and always up to date 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 to ask, so to speak 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.710
 and then you ask on the lido 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.390
 faction leader after a one-year term 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 stay just a normal holiday 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.790
 why visa can have and tune 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.689
 can hang, so to speak, for three months 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 I'm not exactly sure now 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.159
 Sure, just look at the side 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.810
 the immigration office of australia 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.070
 After that it is explained to me exactly 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.790
 according to my opinion so far always 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.550
 have understood 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.170
 you have to if you do not have a connection visa 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.670
 has left the country 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.180
 I do not know if you have one 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.560
 vacation visa from australia 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.670
 I can probably apply for that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.190
 I guess now a pure guess 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.260
 You can not do it a vacation trip 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.150
 from outside of australia 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.530
 so to speak, you could be requested 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.850
 now, of course, just after 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.710
 the detour to thailand and afterwards 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.810
 crave that new zealand enter there 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.950
 vacation request or apply to these 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.810
 that will be issued immediately 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.030
 make everything online and then again 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.020
 back to australia though 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.760
 you do not on this vacation visa 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.040
 Yes, that's what money means 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.020
 What she will for this in three months 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.020
 stay then needed should you 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.600
 previously earned, so to speak 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.430
 ok, i'm looking for you soon 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:54.450
 another one has another question 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.700
 you are not too far otherwise yes 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.750
 if someone ackers the army me 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.340
 the ami may come back to the question 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.020
 can answer if you are the finest 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.950
 Hair on campsite in the shower 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.300
 can be 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.709
 then I would be glad which one 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.900
 just the poor here at the place 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.580
 Otherwise, if that helps you then 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.430
 helped and liked video anyway 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.470
 then I would be very happy 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.760
 and then do not forget my channel 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.019
 Subscribe if you like me 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.730
 Australia kept informed 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.730
 So you want to be there later
