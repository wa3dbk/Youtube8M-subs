hello everyone this is pretty awesome
here<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:02.970> today<00:00:03.240> we<00:00:03.480> are<00:00:03.600> taking<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:04.049> look<00:00:04.290> at

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
here and today we are taking a look at

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.460 
here and today we are taking a look at
lb<00:00:05.009> photorealism<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> texture<00:00:07.200> pack

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
lb photorealism this is the texture pack

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.370 
lb photorealism this is the texture pack
we<00:00:07.649> use<00:00:07.799> throughout<00:00:08.099> episode<00:00:08.760> 1<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:10.050> think

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
we use throughout episode 1 and I think

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.290 
we use throughout episode 1 and I think
too<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.860> any<00:00:11.070> shop<00:00:11.370> basically<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> manner

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
too and any shop basically in the manner

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.780 
too and any shop basically in the manner
and<00:00:12.650> maybe<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.040> two<00:00:14.070> times<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.610> other

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and maybe one or two times and other

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.820 
and maybe one or two times and other
shots<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.330> depends<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:15.990> anyways

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
shots that really depends but anyways

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
shots that really depends but anyways
this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.310> pack<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.640> used<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.210> figured<00:00:18.510> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
this is the pack we used and I figured I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
this is the pack we used and I figured I
would<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> video<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.619> instead<00:00:20.220> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
would do a video on it instead of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
would do a video on it instead of
responding<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> YouTube<00:00:21.300> comments<00:00:21.539> just

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
responding to the YouTube comments just

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.300 
responding to the YouTube comments just
because<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.500> would<00:00:22.619> might<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> little<00:00:23.130> bit

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
because this would might be a little bit

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.550 
because this would might be a little bit
more<00:00:23.430> entertaining<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.900> get<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
more entertaining and you get to see the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
more entertaining and you get to see the
texture<00:00:25.830> pack<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.279> more<00:00:26.460> detail<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.060> more<00:00:28.050> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
texture pack in more detail and more of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.599 
texture pack in more detail and more of
the<00:00:28.170> blocks<00:00:28.410> other<00:00:28.830> than<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> ones<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.429> just

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the blocks other than the ones we just

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.840 
the blocks other than the ones we just
used<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> episode<00:00:30.240> 1<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.460> here<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> quick

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
used in episode 1 so here is a quick

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.540 
used in episode 1 so here is a quick
overview<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> blocks<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.520> while<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
overview of all the blocks and while I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.639 
overview of all the blocks and while I
show<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:37.290> would<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
show them to you I just would like to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
show them to you I just would like to
say<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.460> texture<00:00:38.850> pack<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.719> think

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
say that this texture pack has I think

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
say that this texture pack has I think
the<00:00:40.140> most<00:00:40.320> detail<00:00:40.739> packed<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the most detail packed in out of all the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.229 
the most detail packed in out of all the
other<00:00:42.870> ones<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.550> just<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.670> again

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
other ones out there just because again

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
other ones out there just because again
zooming<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:45.899> fast<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.430> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
zooming and really fast you just you can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
zooming and really fast you just you can
see<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:48.090> attention<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.600> detail<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
see the little attention to detail that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.830 
see the little attention to detail that
the<00:00:49.379> creator's<00:00:49.980> used<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the creator's used which I just think is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
the creator's used which I just think is
fantastic<00:00:52.110> especially<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> shin<00:00:53.550> amo

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
fantastic especially from the shin amo

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
fantastic especially from the shin amo
work<00:00:53.930> for<00:00:54.930> those<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> guys<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.440> want<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
work for those of you guys that want to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.860 
work for those of you guys that want to
get<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.340> most<00:00:56.610> detail<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> Minecraft<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
get the most detail out of Minecraft you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.670 
get the most detail out of Minecraft you
can<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> definitely<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.640> pack<00:00:59.789> for

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
can this is definitely the pack for

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
can this is definitely the pack for
furthermore<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> blocks

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
furthermore I think that all the blocks

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.570 
furthermore I think that all the blocks
meld<00:01:03.510> together<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:04.049> well<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
meld together really well and by that I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.420 
meld together really well and by that I
mean<00:01:05.670> nothing<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> place

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
mean nothing is really out of place

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
mean nothing is really out of place
again<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.820> only<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.810> out

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
again the only two that I think are out

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
again the only two that I think are out
of<00:01:10.080> place<00:01:10.170> probably<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.040> pumpkins<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> or

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
of place probably be the pumpkins and or

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.380 
of place probably be the pumpkins and or
the<00:01:12.510> jukebox<00:01:13.170> thingy<00:01:13.500> needs<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.130> too

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
the jukebox thingy needs over here too

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
the jukebox thingy needs over here too
but<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.659> mean<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> whole<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> texture<00:01:17.159> pack

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
but I mean as a whole the texture pack

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.200 
but I mean as a whole the texture pack
is<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.820> perfect<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.689> mel's<00:01:19.380> together

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
is just perfect and mel's together

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
is just perfect and mel's together
without<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.360> hitch<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> lot<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
without a hitch and I think a lot of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
without a hitch and I think a lot of
other<00:01:23.610> texture<00:01:24.000> packs<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.479> HD<00:01:24.930> like

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
other texture packs that are HD like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.499 
other texture packs that are HD like
this<00:01:25.320> tend<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> suffer<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> they

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this tend to suffer from that and they

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
this tend to suffer from that and they
don't<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
don't they don't really take the time to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.340 
don't they don't really take the time to
really<00:01:30.090> concentrate<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:30.960> sure<00:01:31.049> these

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
really concentrate and make sure these

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
really concentrate and make sure these
things<00:01:31.590> work<00:01:31.799> together<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.400> definite<00:01:33.329> kudos

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
things work together so definite kudos

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.039 
things work together so definite kudos
to<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> creators<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:36.049> just

look at the mobs because I really like
the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.790 
the
in<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.220> game<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.550> well<00:02:15.319> well<00:02:16.319> not<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> moms

just<00:02:20.060> absolutely<00:02:21.060> fantastic<00:02:21.630> i<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:21.750> i<00:02:22.110> like

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
just absolutely fantastic i think i like

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.170 
just absolutely fantastic i think i like
when<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.680> take<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> time<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.610> put<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
when they take the time to put the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.000 
when they take the time to put the
amount<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> detail<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.980> know

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
amount of detail and to you know

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.320 
amount of detail and to you know
everything<00:02:26.520> else<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> game<00:02:27.000> other<00:02:27.209> than

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
everything else in the game other than

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.470 
everything else in the game other than
just<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.050> blocks<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:30.239> really

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
just the blocks and that's really

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.990 
just the blocks and that's really
important<00:02:30.959> part<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.709> think<00:02:32.130> got<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
important part of this I think got the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.190 
important part of this I think got the
chickens<00:02:33.420> who<00:02:33.989> happen<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.709> have<00:02:34.920> laid<00:02:35.100> an<00:02:35.250> egg

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
chickens who happen to have laid an egg

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600 
chickens who happen to have laid an egg
and<00:02:37.200> here's<00:02:37.590> some<00:02:37.739> other<00:02:37.920> creatures<00:02:38.340> over

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
and here's some other creatures over

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.860 
and here's some other creatures over
here<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.890> he<00:02:40.890> spawns<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:43.099> at<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.250> skeletons

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
here as he spawns them at the skeletons

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.509 
here as he spawns them at the skeletons
yeah<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.900> mean<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> amount<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.340> attention

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
yeah I mean just the amount of attention

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.490 
yeah I mean just the amount of attention
to<00:02:47.760> detail<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.959> absolutely

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
to detail I just think is absolutely

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.039 
to detail I just think is absolutely
fantastic<00:02:50.069> in<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.610> texture<00:02:50.940> pack<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
fantastic in this texture pack got the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.410 
fantastic in this texture pack got the
wolves<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.709> some<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.670> these<00:02:53.730> other<00:02:53.850> guys<00:02:54.090> over

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
wolves and some of these other guys over

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.100 
wolves and some of these other guys over
here<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.040> there<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.610> running<00:02:56.880> away<00:02:57.120> but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
here and there it is running away but

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.410 
here and there it is running away but
close<00:02:58.380> enough<00:02:58.880> while<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.000> deal<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.330> that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
close enough while you deal with that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.140 
close enough while you deal with that
have<00:03:00.690> fun<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.489> let's<00:03:02.489> actually<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.910> take<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
have fun and let's actually go take a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.789 
have fun and let's actually go take a
look<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.840> house<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.560> did<00:03:04.799> um<00:03:09.560> I'm<00:03:10.560> too

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
look at the house that we did um I'm too

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.680 
look at the house that we did um I'm too
lazy<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.160> walk<00:03:11.280> over<00:03:11.459> there<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
lazy to walk over there so this is a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.600 
lazy to walk over there so this is a
quick<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.230> mock-up<00:03:13.500> we<00:03:13.769> did<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.160> show<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
quick little mock-up we did to show the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.490 
quick little mock-up we did to show the
texture<00:03:14.940> pack<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.720> more<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.350> practical

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
texture pack and more of a practical

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.349 
texture pack and more of a practical
purpose<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.370> what<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.760> would<00:03:17.850> build<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
purpose of what you would build with it

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.210 
purpose of what you would build with it
and<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:19.350> think<00:03:19.410> they<00:03:19.650> were<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:20.010> for<00:03:20.190> a

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
and I think they were going for a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.360 
and I think they were going for a
medieval<00:03:20.549> theme<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:20.850> this<00:03:20.970> pack<00:03:21.230> however<00:03:22.370> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
medieval theme with this pack however it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
medieval theme with this pack however it
is<00:03:23.880> kind<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.390> medieval<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.989> mean<00:03:25.530> it's<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.390> don't

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
is kind of medieval I mean it's I don't

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.460 
is kind of medieval I mean it's I don't
know<00:03:27.450> how<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.600> explain<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.900> other<00:03:28.079> than<00:03:28.290> that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
know how to explain it other than that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.920 
know how to explain it other than that
because<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.310> general<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.780> can

do so much with it you'll get them
you'll<00:03:34.500> get<00:03:34.620> them<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.090> general

with this pack which is which is
fantastic<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:48.109> some<00:03:49.109> of<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.260> wheat<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
fantastic and some of the wheat and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.860 
fantastic and some of the wheat and
various<00:03:50.790> stages<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.690> growing<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.870> let's

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
various stages of it growing and let's

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.650 
various stages of it growing and let's
take<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.049> look<00:03:55.230> inside<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.680> house<00:03:55.829> shall<00:03:56.519> we

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
take a look inside the house shall we

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.660 
take a look inside the house shall we
and<00:03:57.769> there<00:03:58.769> we<00:03:58.829> go<00:03:59.600> close<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.630> door<00:04:00.810> and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
and there we go close that door and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.890 
and there we go close that door and
here's<00:04:02.670> where<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.970> can<00:04:03.090> see<00:04:03.269> everything<00:04:03.780> when

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
here's where you can see everything when

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.130 
here's where you can see everything when
it<00:04:03.930> melds<00:04:04.170> together<00:04:04.319> um<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.880> it's<00:04:06.780> where<00:04:06.930> it's

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
it melds together um and it's where it's

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.569 
it melds together um and it's where it's
really<00:04:07.380> important<00:04:07.799> sure<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.250> show<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
really important sure I can show the

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.979 
really important sure I can show the
little<00:04:08.760> blocks<00:04:09.090> out<00:04:09.329> there<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.780> how<00:04:09.840> they

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
little blocks out there and how they

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.319 
little blocks out there and how they
look<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:10.410> what's<00:04:10.620> really<00:04:10.799> important<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.400> how

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
look but what's really important is how

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.930 
look but what's really important is how
everything<00:04:12.720> melds<00:04:13.620> which<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.579> pretty<00:04:14.819> much

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
everything melds which is pretty much

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.270 
everything melds which is pretty much
seamlessly<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.530> creates<00:04:16.799> an<00:04:16.919> excellent

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
seamlessly and it creates an excellent

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.690 
seamlessly and it creates an excellent
atmosphere<00:04:17.729> too<00:04:17.940> um<00:04:19.100> also<00:04:20.100> here<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.519> red

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
atmosphere too um also here is the red

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.399 
atmosphere too um also here is the red
bricks<00:04:20.940> which<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.389> probably<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> best

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
bricks which is probably one of the best

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.500 
bricks which is probably one of the best
red<00:04:22.710> bricks<00:04:22.950> out<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.700> tend<00:04:24.210> not<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.479> use

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
red bricks out there I tend not to use

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.690 
red bricks out there I tend not to use
them<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.870> much<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.380> you'll<00:04:25.470> see<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:26.039> a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
them that much and you'll see that in a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.830 
them that much and you'll see that in a
future<00:04:27.060> episodes<00:04:27.479> of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
future episodes of

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.900 
future episodes of
just<00:04:28.500> because<00:04:28.740> most<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.070> them<00:04:29.190> just<00:04:29.400> look<00:04:29.580> ugly

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
just because most of them just look ugly

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.500 
just because most of them just look ugly
but<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.480> this<00:04:30.630> case<00:04:31.520> fantastic<00:04:32.520> hello<00:04:33.330> there

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
but in this case fantastic hello there

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
the house a little bit more I can go to

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.080 
the house a little bit more I can go to
a<00:04:40.320> new<00:04:40.470> detail<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.040> some<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.340> plants<00:04:41.900> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
a new detail here some of the plants and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.820 
a new detail here some of the plants and
yeah<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:45.510> this<00:04:45.810> is<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.290> a<00:04:46.500> quick<00:04:46.740> little

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
yeah so this is just a quick little

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.980 
yeah so this is just a quick little
review<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.520> one<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.419> purposes<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.960> can

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
review of one of the purposes you can

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.530 
review of one of the purposes you can
use<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.320> for<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.220> let's<00:04:50.970> go<00:04:51.030> take<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.300> look<00:04:51.360> at

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
use it for and let's go take a look at

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.480 
use it for and let's go take a look at
the<00:04:51.630> mountains<00:04:51.780> over<00:04:52.139> here<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:53.220> we're<00:04:53.370> going

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
the mountains over here and we're going

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.680 
the mountains over here and we're going
to<00:04:53.550> go<00:04:53.699> look<00:04:54.630> at<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.050> terrain<00:04:55.440> hi<00:04:55.830> kitty<00:04:56.070> cat

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
to go look at the terrain hi kitty cat

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.870 
to go look at the terrain hi kitty cat
and<00:04:58.610> let's<00:04:59.610> fly<00:05:01.430> when<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.520> comes<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.760> the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
and let's fly when it comes to the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.800 
and let's fly when it comes to the
terrain<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.360> actually<00:05:03.600> like<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:05.660> there<00:05:06.660> we<00:05:06.720> go

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
terrain I actually like the there we go

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.210 
terrain I actually like the there we go
yeah<00:05:07.350> when<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.590> comes<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.919> terrain<00:05:08.100> I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
yeah when it comes to the terrain I

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.219 
yeah when it comes to the terrain I
think<00:05:08.550> again<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.120> one<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.750> my<00:05:09.900> favorite

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
think again this is one of my favorite

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.350 
think again this is one of my favorite
parts<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.620> texture<00:05:10.979> pack<00:05:11.160> just<00:05:12.060> because

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
parts of the texture pack just because

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.840 
parts of the texture pack just because
it<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:13.050> realistic<00:05:14.040> none<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.669> grass

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
it is realistic none of the grass

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.590 
it is realistic none of the grass
textures<00:05:15.389> are<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.720> stretch<00:05:16.080> door<00:05:16.410> messed<00:05:16.770> up

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
textures are like stretch door messed up

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.790 
textures are like stretch door messed up
especially<00:05:18.600> showing<00:05:19.289> how<00:05:19.440> they<00:05:19.560> melt

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
especially showing how they melt

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.430 
especially showing how they melt
together<00:05:19.919> in<00:05:20.190> these<00:05:20.310> blocks<00:05:20.580> here<00:05:21.260> it's<00:05:22.260> just

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
together in these blocks here it's just

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.159 
together in these blocks here it's just
really<00:05:22.560> natural<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.250> organic<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.720> think

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
really natural and organic and I think

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.840 
really natural and organic and I think
I'll<00:05:25.320> quite<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> few<00:05:25.889> texture<00:05:26.160> packs<00:05:26.340> tend<00:05:26.699> to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
I'll quite a few texture packs tend to

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.879 
I'll quite a few texture packs tend to
fail<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.120> little<00:05:27.479> bit<00:05:27.600> at<00:05:28.410> least<00:05:28.470> one<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.770> the

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
fail a little bit at least one of the

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.230 
fail a little bit at least one of the
higher<00:05:29.039> resolutions<00:05:29.669> out<00:05:29.789> there<00:05:29.970> for<00:05:30.150> this

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
higher resolutions out there for this

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.480 
higher resolutions out there for this
type<00:05:30.419> of<00:05:30.449> stuff<00:05:30.660> and<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.830> creators<00:05:32.130> really

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
type of stuff and the creators really

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.760 
type of stuff and the creators really
took<00:05:32.610> their<00:05:32.789> time<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.810> effort<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.289> put<00:05:34.320> detail

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
took their time and effort to put detail

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.730 
took their time and effort to put detail
into<00:05:34.950> it<00:05:35.160> which<00:05:35.280> I<00:05:35.430> like<00:05:35.669> a<00:05:35.880> lot<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.740> here's

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
into it which I like a lot and here's

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.610 
into it which I like a lot and here's
some<00:05:37.919> more<00:05:38.100> of<00:05:38.340> like<00:05:38.639> hell<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:40.139> shrubs<00:05:40.470> look

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
some more of like hell the shrubs look

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.600 
some more of like hell the shrubs look
very<00:05:41.370> very<00:05:41.460> detailed<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:43.130> again<00:05:44.130> the

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
very very detailed and and again the

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.010 
very very detailed and and again the
texture<00:05:44.970> loops<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.419> repeats<00:05:45.750> very

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
texture loops and repeats very
