00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
plug the smaller end into that guy here

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.909 
plug the smaller end into that guy here
just<00:04:08.979> like<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:10.019> after<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.169> you<00:04:11.739> want

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
just like that and after that you want

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.069 
just like that and after that you want
to<00:04:11.979> use<00:04:12.219> the<00:04:12.639> other<00:04:12.969> end<00:04:13.299> of<00:04:13.449> that<00:04:13.509> optical

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
to use the other end of that optical

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.289 
to use the other end of that optical
cable<00:04:14.439> and<00:04:14.590> plug<00:04:15.159> it<00:04:15.400> at<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.789> back<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.209> your

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299

Xbox<00:04:16.780> one

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
Xbox one

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.999 
Xbox one
after<00:04:19.180> that<00:04:19.329> I<00:04:19.569> mean<00:04:19.959> that's<00:04:20.169> essentially<00:04:20.829> all

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
after that I mean that's essentially all

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.180 
after that I mean that's essentially all
you<00:04:21.220> need<00:04:21.400> for<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.750> PC<00:04:23.139> so<00:04:23.379> to<00:04:23.440> talk<00:04:23.800> on<00:04:24.039> skype

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
you need for the PC so to talk on skype

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.420 
you need for the PC so to talk on skype
in<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.819> PC<00:04:25.240> that's<00:04:26.229> all<00:04:26.379> you<00:04:26.500> need<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.830> then

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
in the PC that's all you need and then

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.010 
in the PC that's all you need and then
that's<00:04:27.759> probably<00:04:27.879> what<00:04:28.270> I'm<00:04:28.360> gonna<00:04:28.479> do

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
that's probably what I'm gonna do

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.550 
that's probably what I'm gonna do
using<00:04:29.889> this<00:04:29.979> mix<00:04:30.310> amp<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:31.389> if<00:04:31.659> you<00:04:32.050> do<00:04:32.289> want<00:04:32.530> to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
using this mix amp but if you do want to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.399 
using this mix amp but if you do want to
use<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.949> Xbox<00:04:33.340> one<00:04:33.460> I'll<00:04:33.849> show<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.360> how<00:04:34.599> so

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
use it on Xbox one I'll show you how so

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.649 
use it on Xbox one I'll show you how so
this<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.710> what<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.949> got<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.159> do<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.330> your

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
this is what you got to do you have your

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.460 
this is what you got to do you have your
Xbox<00:04:38.050> controller<00:04:38.620> right<00:04:38.800> over<00:04:39.009> here<00:04:39.629> and<00:04:40.629> so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
Xbox controller right over here and so

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.290 
Xbox controller right over here and so
in<00:04:41.830> order<00:04:41.979> to<00:04:42.129> for<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.759> work<00:04:42.849> you<00:04:43.120> need<00:04:43.240> to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
in order to for this to work you need to

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.689 
in order to for this to work you need to
buy<00:04:43.569> a<00:04:43.599> few<00:04:43.960> things<00:04:44.129> so<00:04:45.129> you<00:04:45.190> need<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.520> buy<00:04:45.639> the

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
buy a few things so you need to buy the

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.480 
buy a few things so you need to buy the
Xbox<00:04:46.360> one<00:04:46.569> adapter<00:04:47.050> which<00:04:47.319> probably<00:04:47.919> most<00:04:48.400> of

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
Xbox one adapter which probably most of

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.719 
Xbox one adapter which probably most of
you<00:04:48.639> have<00:04:48.849> if<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.539> have<00:04:49.629> an<00:04:49.750> Xbox<00:04:50.080> one<00:04:50.199> and

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
you have if you have an Xbox one and

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.330 
you have if you have an Xbox one and
after<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.990> also<00:04:53.169> comes<00:04:53.530> with<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.830> 2.5

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
after that that also comes with the 2.5

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.589 
after that that also comes with the 2.5
to<00:04:55.060> 3.5<00:04:55.449> converter<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.729> you'll<00:04:58.030> have<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.389> have

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
to 3.5 converter and you'll have to have

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.710 
to 3.5 converter and you'll have to have
a<00:04:58.900> wire<00:04:59.319> that<00:04:59.740> allows<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:01.030> go<00:05:01.180> from<00:05:01.419> your

controller<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.770> your<00:05:03.009> headset<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:04.210> after<00:05:04.569> that

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
controller to your headset so after that

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.409 
controller to your headset so after that
this<00:05:05.349> one<00:05:05.560> here<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.919> just<00:05:05.949> a<00:05:06.190> turtlebeach<00:05:06.669> wire

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
this one here is just a turtlebeach wire

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.240 
this one here is just a turtlebeach wire
the<00:05:07.930> thing<00:05:08.139> was<00:05:08.289> like<00:05:08.319> 20<00:05:08.710> bucks<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:09.009> future

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.149 
really yeah what's Microsoft doing is
just<00:05:51.759> I<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:53.110> know<00:05:53.229> getting<00:05:53.620> more<00:05:53.770> money<00:05:53.979> off

just I you know getting more money off
of<00:05:54.340> us<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.759> it's<00:05:55.719> pretty<00:05:55.900> much<00:05:55.960> what<00:05:56.229> it<00:05:56.319> is

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
of us and it's pretty much what it is

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.790 
of us and it's pretty much what it is
because<00:05:57.430> they<00:05:57.699> can't<00:05:57.940> make<00:05:58.150> wires<00:05:59.020> they<00:05:59.680> have

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
because they can't make wires they have
