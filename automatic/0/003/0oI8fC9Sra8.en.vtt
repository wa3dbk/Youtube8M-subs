00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.010
 and it's called like that because when 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.000
 she said matrices that maybe that 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.190
 I go to the heart matrix in front of 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 different way 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.980
 and he referred to his side as a boom 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.980
 very good 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.300
 a shot 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.050
 it is not like that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.780
 sorry 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.700
 good 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.980
 the onion in the living walls how 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 moves in the days 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.120
 12 to 12 hours of green and it was not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.720
 able to breathe normally 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.720
 as we said 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.510
 well up to the supposed ten and 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.400
 fourth that became almost 34 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.060
 plus 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 wait 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.420
 that everyone knows the reasons for 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.420
 when someone talks too much 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.520
 two hearts flowers 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.330
 but my look from madrid in search of a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.330
 goal 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.860
 looking for a corner to sit on was 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.440
 look for you has a better angle where to look 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.610
 the first image of your profile was going to be 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.610
 key to survive 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 d 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.700
 but when I saw you for the first time I have 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.310
 to admit that I understood all the poetry 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.670
 blow 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.540
 all the kisses I read before you in 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.730
 your name 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.730
 I could not do anything else but him 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.400
 the gift of some ends for later 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 leave them too 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.760
 after doing the faces in the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.840
 brakes on the hands that bump into 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.489
 little moles in those alien entities 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 cold feet looking for heat 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.540
 under the sheets 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.780
 could be the camera the zinc any 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.780
 place 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 in smiles devoid of fires and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.920
 those reflected in the ground 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 you had to be the first one before 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.260
 you imagine next to you in my body 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.260
 of oil 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.890
 and I still do not understand what you're doing here 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.330
 that came to madrid because I because 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.080
 my 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.080
 he manifested 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.400
 but fuck after knowing your 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.990
 clavicle I stay with everything between being 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.190
 before all the charges 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.190
 despite the injuries 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.330
 let me not think once a week that 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.330
 my routine has the right to continue standing 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.000
 and makes the return
