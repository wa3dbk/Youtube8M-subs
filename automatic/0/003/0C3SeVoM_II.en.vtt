I<00:00:00.949> had<00:00:01.949> fun<00:00:02.220> writing<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.879> program<00:00:03.270> notes<00:00:03.449> for

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659

I had fun writing the program notes for
this<00:00:03.810> concert<00:00:04.470> particularly<00:00:05.460> about<00:00:05.819> Weber

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
this concert particularly about Weber

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.080 
this concert particularly about Weber
although<00:00:08.540> three<00:00:09.540> pieces<00:00:10.160> performed<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.519> their

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
although three pieces performed in their

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.860 
although three pieces performed in their
entirety<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:13.110> less<00:00:13.769> than<00:00:14.040> two<00:00:14.250> minutes<00:00:14.870> would

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
entirety for less than two minutes would

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.310 
entirety for less than two minutes would
be<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:17.130> kind<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.520> joke<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:18.810> really

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
be like a kind of joke but it's really

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.070 
be like a kind of joke but it's really
not<00:00:19.650> even<00:00:20.070> though<00:00:20.460> Weber<00:00:20.880> ins<00:00:21.090> entire<00:00:21.689> output

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
not even though Weber ins entire output

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.179 
not even though Weber ins entire output
is<00:00:22.710> less<00:00:23.640> music<00:00:24.180> than<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.900> partner<00:00:25.500> opera

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
compact that it necessarily has to be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.889 
compact that it necessarily has to be
done<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.260> very<00:00:37.500> short<00:00:37.800> amount<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.160> time
