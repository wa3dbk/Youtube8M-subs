00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello girls to another video lesson from 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.160
 lord slipper 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.990
 I would not take it and water I left heavy for 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.509
 light point connection 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 We'll use the hole pliers . 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:28.470
 which is sold on the website of the extra that is read 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.080
 not even separated out ' 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.110
 you make a straight line from the middle of the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.520
 flip flops forward and one goes home 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.090
 without the flag as you can mark 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.129
 people use this thicker 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:54.210
 damage is recommended is next or 24 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:58.870
 So you put my straight turn into a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:04.810
 page only to cut 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:08.840
 then do the straight up here and 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:12.440
 You do not have to squeeze too much because 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.860
 do not need to stick the slipper to the other 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:22.790
 side is just to cut this first 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:33.130
 layer and makes 16 qa between the two 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:37.039
 Did you ever go near after you hold it? 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.429
 with the help of the league had you with him 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.429

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:52.670
 need not withdraw was for years the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.429
 people wearing super technician put on 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.429

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.739
 pick up the light continuum 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.690
 and put another hole 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.580
 the point of light it does not need to enter 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.650
 inside the hole 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 it's just this back that he's more 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:38.690
 chubby than the one that fits in 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:41.890

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.890
