00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.310
 yeah 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.310
 Good 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:18.800
 This corner introduces the pushing twink jockey of each racetrack 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:25.220
 The 13th is the local horse racing superstar Tozaki Keita Kishu 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.450
 We talked with No. 1 Jockey who is riding Nori right now that the central g 1 is conquered last year 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.300
 Has been 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.070
 Death 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.600
 Last year's victory at Yasuda Memorial 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:40.720
 It was really amazing- it's cool to win in the middle g 1 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.140
 What kind of thing did you think before you went to the race 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.820
 I was happy just to get it on g 1 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.170
 That on real impact 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.130
 Riding 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:57.870
 When the request comes, that horse's power 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:02.699
 I got down on a memory that I wanted to ride 100% out of the way 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.700
 The pension was also the 9th most popular, so it's nice to catch it and feel free to say 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.470
 It was Mashi Anori thinking of Koyo enjoy 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.630
 How was the moment you scored 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.740
 It is the best to say that it was not accepted soon 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 I have been there and that kind of model around me 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 Is I remember vividly the Tteyuu that heard something like Tteyuu Ne we Taka wins 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 I think that Miyazaki jockey is riding various famous horses 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:36.710
 Horses that are particularly impressive 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:42.190
 During the pretend, I had many experiences and I learned many things. 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.190
 It is full of feeling that I'm so embarrassing 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.930
 Tell me the most memorable race in Freiso 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.470
 Funabashi 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.240
 I bought it for a while and I have the most memorable memory 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.790
 It is related to the swamp 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 I thought it might be the best around 2000m 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.830
 Because the worries are 1006 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.149
 Hey school 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.159
 Of It was also anxiety 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.670
 There was a question of what kind of horse racing to play but at that time the atmosphere was very good 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:21.110
 Because the state was also good 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.069
 It looks very impressive because have won the g 1 in that local Funabashi 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.920
 yeah 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:30.010
 I think it's good to be in communication 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.030
 If this run through in the first place to say stamps 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.660
 Whatever race 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.590
 The most really was good Do Tteyuu think 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.590
 Always there 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.220
 On the contrary, when was it hard 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.500
 Until that Nike Adi light 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.500
 When I got a lot of awards 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.860
 I was so excited about it and I knew the race was crazy, but there is that race. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.640
 The 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.130
 Because say is was really where the growth is felt by yourself 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.510
 It's been hard to say that it's supposed to be now 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.710
 I think 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.250
 rar 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.630
 I have a good model 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.480
 I 'm sorry to talk well 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.280
 is not it 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.720
 Some birthdays together 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.720
 Is it different? 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.950
 Say this race is I want to buy 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.510
 It's a Grand Prize Tokyo Grand Prize 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.730
 I think I want to win every year 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.120
 I will 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.430
 Hey, good to win if 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.430
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.290
 The story changes, but for Miyazaki jockey 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.220
 I think the milk of Oi Racecourse 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.430
 The best place to go 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.020
 The sale of 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.160
 There is also a night game 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.300
 This high 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.410
 There is also a wonderful stand 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.410
 Because it is the largest large racetrack in a regional racetrack 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.069
 It depends on the call from the start 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.230
 In I think it's course 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:16.620
 That place to say so 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:22.160
 I think it can be enjoyed if you look at the race while already watching 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:28.730
 Then a word to all the fans watching horse racing on the net at the end 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.720
 The internet has been restored so much and I bought that back even if I could not come to that racetrack 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.980
 I think there are many people who can 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.230
 By all means 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:43.600
 Come to the racetrack that 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:45.460
 If you see the race live and enjoy the betting ticket, so much fun from the public again 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.620
 I think it will increase 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.230
 Maan 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.750
 To each Racecourse of the local horse racing 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.340
 Please have them come by all means 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.340
 I think I want you to enjoy the brush 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.090
