00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.601
 This theme is 

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:09.990
 Someone who is confident in the backhand 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 A person who wants to score by swinging the backhand 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.890
 How to serve serve effective in the game recommended for such people 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.880
 I discovered you are good at backhand 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.919
 I think if the score rate goes up from that serve 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.130
 Please take this video as a reference 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.700
 It is this serve but by using it 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.150
 There are two benefits that can be obtained 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.980
 The first thing is that you can collect the ball on the back side 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.750
 It is easy to collect it in the bag and shake it 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.070
 One thing is that let's create a deployment 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 The other is a backhand without a spare 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.730
 It is easy to shake and this is also a big feature 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.830
 I think I will gather in the back yet 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.530
 By putting out that serve myself 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.900
 It is natural to say that such movement from the side 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.220
 Because it is a serve that is easy to naturally 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 It will serve two birds with one stone, so backhand 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.120
 I can recommend it to anyone who wants to shake 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.780
 I'm serving it So that way 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.960
 I would like to introduce that method 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.370
 When serving normally, serve from the back side 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.390
 I think there are a lot of people out there 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.490
 This time from the middle a bit 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.729
 I will try to serve serve from the middle side 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.050
 The opponent turns serve with gyro rotation 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:54.080
 I put it back 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.479
 First of all by serving this serve 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 First of all, the characteristic comes from the middle 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.119
 Is a big feature though 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.770
 The position to hold by taking out from the middle naturally 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.080
 I'll be in the middle I'll be in the middle 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.039
 It is difficult for the other party to receive the fore 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.969
 When I receive to the fore 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.749
 It may be hit with a blow 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:18.069
 There is a sense of fear so a little back 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.540
 There is a tendency to gather, and we will turn further 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.499
 Because it is released by the side rotation of the gyro system 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.480
 The other party can receive straight 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.230
 It becomes so difficult that it is called its rotation and position 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.159
 It gathers in the back naturally by these two effects 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.939
 It will be more usual and it will be 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.319
 If you look at it from that screen 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.810
 I'm going to shake the racket from behind 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.879
 Because a gyro is a side movement 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.730
 After I moved sideways, I said I would go to Aiyai 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.010
 It's very easy to do and go back from back to back 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.809
 I'll hold it here, but if I move this sideways 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.370
 Because you can pull backswing right away in nature 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.909
 It will be very easy to remove 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.950
 This creates two benefits 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.859
 In addition, we are moving closer to the middle 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.829
 Waving from the side when coming back to nature 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.430
 I can also say that various elements 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.439
 It's like being mixed up 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.430
 As a result, serve from this middle 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.549
 In terms of giving out the side rotation by the gyro rotation from the middle 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.269
 It is said that the balls gather on the back and it is easier to leave the door 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.829
 It will be to the person who will be buzzing back 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.389
 Please try by all means because it is a great effective serve 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.099
 Thank you very much
