00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.710
 this whole body specifically for the site 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.570
 maybe 4 mail.ru this today I would like 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.910
 tell you about how to install the mod 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.820
 saw minecraft shock and so i will 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 set on things go on 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.510
 link that I leave in the description 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.210
 do you download locker on need on 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.399
 I personally have a 12 version like me and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.780
 spoke and so start before installing us 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.780
 will need to run minecraft 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.320
 so enter the game 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.070
 wait a little bit disgraced from 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 half a minute 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.800
 now close open 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 bootloader night open and now 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.000
 install here there are two choices 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.280
 installer is the program itself will install 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.350
 and extra the little louder are you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.410
 install but i recommend hitting that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.590
 Here you can 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.720
 you can insert a loader in fact jellimo 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.170
 two blows but it doesn't cost me 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.180
 now clean minecraft and if you 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.700
 will appear here just on the inscription 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.880
 it's written there that little older 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:48.190
 did not find the launcher 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.080
 then you will need to download the launcher 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.440
 which I will leave in the description a link to 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.420
 him 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 I also had such a problem I 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.009
 long enough to think that together 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.590
 do and then found the answer here 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.600
 open the bodies so first by that how are you 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.580
 Download the launcher go to the belt folder 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.630
 minecraft click the right mouse button 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.940
 by sales icon file location but 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.670
 me and no so i turn manually 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:24.760
 cars and here you are throwing our bodies 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:27.010
 non compartments here after be 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.610
 threw in Kalina pacu maynkrafte 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.610
 run 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.650
 and here we have this 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.269
 little window 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.379
 farther you will not be here first 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:44.069
 accounts click accounts and add 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.879
 account deleted and show 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:52.049
 click on the plus sign username 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:55.379
 enter your nickname and click create 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.040
 account and that's how it stands on the button 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.230
 home and choose here because if 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.689
 install a forge or something like that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.359
 here's a laughter or 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.099
 optifine get to port 17 but I have 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.620
 there is nothing arranged so you pro 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.690
 version click enter the game 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.230
 why at least until 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.970
 need to match the game then you have so 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.519
 Immediately you can not find a couple of files 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.970
 will download and then you will throw 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.160
 around and after you did that 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.239
 what I showed you now you won't have 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.870
 anymore it's just inscriptions and so push 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.660
 ok and as we see we have successfully concluded 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.230
 go around loader now run our 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 launcher 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:51.260
 so here we choose an unusual version of a 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.260
 little older run versions 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.060
 here is little older 1-2 push these groups 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.060
 So 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.690
 it can already be closed and now we have 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.100
 have you established a laughter unlike 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.040
 hips or 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.590
 hodge he does not add extra 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.480
 line could he adds, this is such a 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.410
 tab on the right with chicken and here we are 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.410
 can see 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.820
 we can see the fashion that we 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.030
 have established 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.920
 also here you can configure them in contrast 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.350
 from later but 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.690
 if you installed forge you can also 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.860
 set up only 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.480
 you will have to exit the game and 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.220
 configured by root folder 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.100
 minecraft here you can configure 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.200
 right in this panel does it allow 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.090
 Maud 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.830
