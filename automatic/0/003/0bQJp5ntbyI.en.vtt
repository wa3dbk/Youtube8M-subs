also believe that why making as an
artist<00:01:12.060> follows<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> science<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.200> there's<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
artist follows the science so there's a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.469 
artist follows the science so there's a
strong<00:01:13.710> correlation<00:01:13.890> between<00:01:14.400> great<00:01:15.060> art<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
strong correlation between great art and
