 last last two years of gm 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 In this case it seemed the book 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.850
 de 1 and may 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.850
 Here you will find many exercises 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.660
 is learned and the movement and the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.329
 become notes 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.610
 the next book is the book rudiment 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.280
 want the two teachers will be in the three 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.110
 courses and find ice lives here 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.460
 mentioned the technique of flims and red 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.460
 and live in the overview 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.910
 müller technology with the technology 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.260
 a very old technology like piece attitude 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.589
 is different too 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.420
 learn everything in the book and on the 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.940
 DVD 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.030
 I'll show you how it works 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.040
 main feature of the müller technique the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.060
 müller technology is also practical 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.759
 an up and down 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.479
 but here the tree becomes completely 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.200
 exploited 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.970
 you keep your finger all the fingers like that 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.720
 as if your shadow plays one 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.320
 dog infected So will consist in there 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.970
 He has 42 cm to get out and 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.970
 now he can be dwindling 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.710
 the movement is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:37.000
 if you have two played we can 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:37.000
 also play three or 4 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:45.800
 Now we play an exercise page 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:48.680
 42 exercise so you see what the 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.740
 miller technology is well intended namely the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.330
 be disputed 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.150
 you see the basic movements 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.530
 now and then doubling if that 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.530
 left hand plays 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.070
 So you see the right hand has nothing 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:37.550
 other than previously done alone 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:40.010
 rehearsing was so nice that she 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.730
 hopefully you have it 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.670
 like 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.180
 You can find more tips on the youtube
