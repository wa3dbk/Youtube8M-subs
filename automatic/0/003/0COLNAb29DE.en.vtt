 Hello, how are you? My name is 31 game. I 'm 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.330
 here today to make a brief comment 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.019
 about multiplayer and east 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.670
 the game looks very promising 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.160
 especially in the part of the multiplayer 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.949
 my impressions on this video are 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.079
 very good but what gives us 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.960
 analyzing is that it is very different from a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.780
 charter I saw that it was frantic and there 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.530
 people will have to use the wisdom and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 play cooperative and cooperative because 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.780
 otherwise we will have no effect on the game and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.780
 we have to use what we have even 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.629
 We have a backpack that has one. 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.940
 on the side there he decided to attack what 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.120
 was inside the house and this effect 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 of this pump it focuses much on top of the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 attacked in the same way as a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 if there is 12 it will totally disrupt 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 This character is slow and will not be 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.460
 a slow arrival 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.420
 then we can see that it will also have the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.700
 salvage part of recovering those 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.049
 breathing live will have enough kind of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.130
 different games, right? 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.810
 with friends accepting game types 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.329
 different in multiplayer and really goes 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.049
 have to be played in cooperative to 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.770
 to be able to win that faction that will 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.049
 be formed a faction or factions and there 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.450
 finally we see this type a sixth 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.009
 sense of what is coming and what 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 it is approaching 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.630
 Good people, that's how it was for my first 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 impressions of the game the last office 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.549
 What is to arrive and I hope 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.110
 You liked being with God if 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.140
 is not registered sign on my 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.140
 The jewel channel on the video was worth
