good<00:03:46.800> actor<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:49.260> know<00:03:49.410> as<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.460> see<00:03:50.610> when

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
good actor you know as you can see when

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.040 
good actor you know as you can see when
he<00:03:50.970> does<00:03:51.120> Gollum<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.660> calm<00:03:52.190> his<00:03:53.190> facial

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
he does Gollum and calm his facial

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.690 
he does Gollum and calm his facial
movements<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.200> his<00:03:55.710> mannerisms<00:03:56.280> and

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
movements and his mannerisms and

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.700 
movements and his mannerisms and
everything<00:03:57.060> are<00:03:57.320> wonderful<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.530> he

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
everything are wonderful and he

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.890 
everything are wonderful and he
apparently<00:03:59.340> loves<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.180> mocap<00:04:00.540> stuff

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
apparently loves to do the mocap stuff

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.960 
apparently loves to do the mocap stuff
and<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:02.040> think<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.490> mocap<00:04:03.060> version<00:04:03.690> of

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
and I think that a mocap version of

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.490 
and I think that a mocap version of
Watchmen<00:04:05.970> would<00:04:06.240> be<00:04:06.300> great<00:04:06.600> actually<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.380> think

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
Watchmen would be great actually I think

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.600 
Watchmen would be great actually I think
I'm<00:04:08.130> okay<00:04:08.550> CGI<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.450> live<00:04:09.630> footage<00:04:10.610> mixture

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
I'm okay CGI and live footage mixture

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.520 
I'm okay CGI and live footage mixture
version<00:04:12.030> wouldn't<00:04:12.210> be<00:04:12.270> great<00:04:12.390> Andy<00:04:13.110> Serkis

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
version wouldn't be great Andy Serkis

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.020 
version wouldn't be great Andy Serkis
I<00:04:13.650> think<00:04:13.860> it's<00:04:14.010> just<00:04:14.250> he's<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.460> really<00:04:15.000> really

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I think it's just he's a really really

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.550 
I think it's just he's a really really
good<00:04:15.300> actor<00:04:15.780> he<00:04:15.870> doesn't<00:04:16.140> get<00:04:16.230> near<00:04:16.470> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
good actor he doesn't get near the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.970 
good actor he doesn't get near the
credit<00:04:16.890> he<00:04:16.950> deserves<00:04:17.330> but<00:04:18.330> uh<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.870> think<00:04:19.650> that

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
credit he deserves but uh I think that

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.300 
credit he deserves but uh I think that
he<00:04:20.070> would<00:04:20.220> be<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> really<00:04:20.850> good<00:04:22.160> really<00:04:23.160> good

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
he would be a really good really good

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.830 
he would be a really good really good

Achilles in Aquaman I see that a lot
being<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.010> Aquaman<00:04:41.610> would<00:04:42.480> be<00:04:42.630> much<00:04:42.810> more

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
being that Aquaman would be much more

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.030

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
more so than Hawk math because Aquaman

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.110 
more so than Hawk math because Aquaman

and you know if Brad Pitt does that
Achilles<00:05:01.169> thing<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:01.650> think<00:05:01.919> that<00:05:02.070> he<00:05:02.190> could

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
Achilles thing I think that he could

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.040 
Achilles thing I think that he could
really<00:05:02.669> breathe<00:05:03.030> some<00:05:03.300> life<00:05:03.330> into<00:05:03.840> this

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
really breathe some life into this

character that really nobody seems to

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.180 
character that really nobody seems to
see<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.169> know<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.530> think<00:05:07.830> he<00:05:07.950> could<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.160> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.700 
see and you know I think he could do a
great<00:05:08.580> job<00:05:08.820> with<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.300> whole<00:05:09.419> anger<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.650> know

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
these are characters that are gonna be

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.409 
these are characters that are gonna be
in<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.050> film<00:05:22.229> said<00:05:22.950> uh<00:05:22.979> you<00:05:23.850> know<00:05:23.970> they're<00:05:24.270> not

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
in the film said uh you know they're not

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.590 
in the film said uh you know they're not
they<00:05:25.020> don't<00:05:25.169> play<00:05:25.350> as<00:05:25.470> big<00:05:25.560> as<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> role<00:05:26.600> Green

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
they don't play as big as a role Green

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.570 
they don't play as big as a role Green
Arrow<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.500> Amy<00:05:28.740> McGregor<00:05:29.070> would<00:05:29.430> do<00:05:29.550> a

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
Arrow I think Amy McGregor would do a

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.580 
Arrow I think Amy McGregor would do a
good<00:05:29.760> green<00:05:30.120> arrow

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
good green arrow

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.200 
good green arrow
he's<00:05:31.590> Ian<00:05:32.010> McGregor<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> very<00:05:32.669> good<00:05:32.820> actor

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
he's Ian McGregor is a very good actor

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.450 
he's Ian McGregor is a very good actor
he<00:05:33.630> also<00:05:33.810> doesn't<00:05:34.110> get<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:35.130> credit<00:05:35.280> he

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
he also doesn't get the credit he

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.719 
he also doesn't get the credit he
deserves<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:37.110> think<00:05:37.410> that<00:05:37.530> if<00:05:37.680> he<00:05:37.729> was

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
deserves and I think that if he was

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.219 
deserves and I think that if he was
given<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.120> role<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.300> green<00:05:39.630> arrow<00:05:39.810> he<00:05:40.050> could

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
given the role of green arrow he could

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.550 
given the role of green arrow he could

Oh b10 no go look at other roles that
he's<00:05:52.320> done<00:05:52.530> and<00:05:52.800> he's<00:05:53.550> a<00:05:53.580> really<00:05:53.820> good<00:05:54.060> actor

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090

he's done and he's a really good actor
and<00:05:54.630> he<00:05:55.229> can<00:05:55.410> really<00:05:55.620> do

he's one of those people who can do
nearly<00:05:58.410> anything<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.669> think<00:05:59.970> he<00:06:00.090> would<00:06:00.210> be

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330

nearly anything and I think he would be
a<00:06:00.360> really<00:06:00.630> good<00:06:00.780> green<00:06:01.050> arrow<00:06:01.940> now<00:06:03.139> he<00:06:04.139> was

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
a really good green arrow now he was

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.250 
a really good green arrow now he was

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
also a harder pick for me but uh this

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.620 
also a harder pick for me but uh this
one<00:06:07.500> was<00:06:07.919> not<00:06:08.130> as<00:06:08.280> hard<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.490> thick<00:06:08.700> Charlize

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630

one was not as hard a thick Charlize

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
now Charlize Theron is a really good

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.200 
now Charlize Theron is a really good
actress<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:15.300> she's<00:06:16.340> physical<00:06:17.340> she<00:06:17.970> could<00:06:18.120> do
