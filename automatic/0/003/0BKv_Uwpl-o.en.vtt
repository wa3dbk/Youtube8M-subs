00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
you've had a strain a lot of times

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.430 
you've had a strain a lot of times
you're<00:00:52.699> gonna<00:00:52.790> think<00:00:53.059> rest<00:00:53.479> rest<00:00:53.870> rest<00:00:54.050> and

you keep thinking a lot of rest will

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.789 
you keep thinking a lot of rest will
take<00:00:56.000> care<00:00:56.150> of<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:56.479> and<00:00:56.930> actually<00:00:57.559> for<00:00:57.769> the

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
take care of this and actually for the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.439 
take care of this and actually for the
first<00:00:57.860> five<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.489> seven<00:00:58.790> days<00:00:58.820> following<00:00:59.390> the

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
first five to seven days following the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.450 
first five to seven days following the
injury<00:00:59.629> it's<00:00:59.870> not<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.019> bad<00:01:00.260> idea<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.589> do<00:01:00.769> that<00:01:00.979> so

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
injury it's not a bad idea to do that so

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.039 
injury it's not a bad idea to do that so
the<00:01:01.549> typical<00:01:01.940> things<00:01:02.120> like<00:01:02.330> ice<00:01:02.540> heat

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
the typical things like ice heat

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.620 
the typical things like ice heat
compression<00:01:03.830> elevation<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.390> basically

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
compression elevation and basically

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.240 
compression elevation and basically
staying<00:01:05.960> off<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.260> or<00:01:06.350> even<00:01:06.470> immobilizing<00:01:07.159> are

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
staying off it or even immobilizing are

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.000 
staying off it or even immobilizing are
bad<00:01:07.580> things<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.030> do<00:01:08.200> after<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.229> strain<00:01:09.860> is

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
bad things to do after that strain is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.890 
bad things to do after that strain is
actually<00:01:10.430> respond<00:01:10.790> much<00:01:10.970> better<00:01:11.030> within<00:01:11.810> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
actually respond much better within the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.740 
actually respond much better within the
ranges<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.260> about<00:01:12.440> 7<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.920> 21<00:01:13.220> days<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.820> more

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
ranges of about 7 to 21 days of more

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.289 
ranges of about 7 to 21 days of more
active<00:01:15.290> type<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.950> mobilization<00:01:16.640> or<00:01:16.940> we<00:01:17.119> call

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
active type of mobilization or we call

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.450 
active type of mobilization or we call
this<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.600> mobilization<00:01:18.260> period<00:01:18.590> things<00:01:19.310> that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
this the mobilization period things that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.920 
this the mobilization period things that
we<00:01:19.610> use<00:01:19.820> within<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:20.270> period<00:01:20.540> are<00:01:20.720> going<00:01:20.869> to

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
we use within this period are going to

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.830 
we use within this period are going to
be<00:01:21.049> reciprocal<00:01:21.590> inhibition<00:01:21.710> stretching<00:01:22.840> or

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
be reciprocal inhibition stretching or

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.539 
be reciprocal inhibition stretching or
some<00:01:24.289> people<00:01:24.469> might<00:01:24.590> call<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.799> like<00:01:25.009> dynamic

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
some people might call it like dynamic

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.840 
some people might call it like dynamic
stretching<00:01:26.030> passive<00:01:26.960> modalities<00:01:27.590> or<00:01:28.219> even

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
stretching passive modalities or even

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.849 
stretching passive modalities or even
light<00:01:29.060> tissue<00:01:29.359> or<00:01:29.659> light<00:01:30.020> massage<00:01:30.409> or<00:01:30.710> good

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
light tissue or light massage or good

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.740 
light tissue or light massage or good
ideas<00:01:31.189> remember<00:01:31.789> within<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.420> mobilization

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
ideas remember within this mobilization

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.300 
ideas remember within this mobilization
period<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> lot<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.649> people<00:01:33.890> really<00:01:34.009> want<00:01:34.130> to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
period a lot of people really want to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.639 
period a lot of people really want to
try<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.179> get<00:01:35.509> deep<00:01:35.689> with<00:01:35.719> those<00:01:35.990> muscles<00:01:36.439> and

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
try to get deep with those muscles and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.230 
try to get deep with those muscles and
try<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.859> really<00:01:37.100> manipulate<00:01:37.640> them<00:01:37.729> it's

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
try to really manipulate them it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.090 
try to really manipulate them it's
actually<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.689> better<00:01:38.869> idea<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.320> keep<00:01:39.710> rather

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
actually a better idea to keep rather

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.190 
actually a better idea to keep rather
light<00:01:40.399> don't<00:01:40.850> stretch<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.240> really<00:01:41.630> hard<00:01:41.810> don't

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
light don't stretch it really hard don't

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.569 
light don't stretch it really hard don't
deed<00:01:42.439> go<00:01:42.619> really<00:01:42.890> deep<00:01:43.039> with<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.280> dish<00:01:43.429> you

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
deed go really deep with the dish you

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.310 
deed go really deep with the dish you
work<00:01:43.729> because<00:01:44.179> these<00:01:44.719> areas<00:01:44.929> are<00:01:45.170> still

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
work because these areas are still

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440 
work because these areas are still
healing<00:01:45.649> some<00:01:46.039> remember<00:01:46.789> if<00:01:46.969> you<00:01:47.060> want<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.299> see

we will call it most research will agree

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.830 
we will call it most research will agree
that<00:02:00.079> about<00:02:00.579> 21<00:02:01.579> days<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.999> about<00:02:02.119> 6<00:02:02.390> weeks<00:02:02.569> is<00:02:02.749> a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
that about 21 days to about 6 weeks is a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.929 
that about 21 days to about 6 weeks is a
good<00:02:03.020> time<00:02:03.289> frame<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.950> strengthen<00:02:04.520> the

good time frame to strengthen the

good time frame to strengthen the

and tendons that have been damaged now

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.860 
and tendons that have been damaged now
it's<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.220> hard<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.240> lot<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.510> athletes

it's really hard for a lot of athletes

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.240 
it's really hard for a lot of athletes
and<00:02:15.020> patients<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.530> feel<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> good

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
and patients to feel this is a good

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.500 
and patients to feel this is a good
thing<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.520> do<00:02:16.640> at<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> time<00:02:17.000> because<00:02:17.330> they

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
thing to do at the time because they

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.390 
thing to do at the time because they
feel<00:02:17.780> very<00:02:18.050> vulnerable<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.130> they<00:02:19.220> feel<00:02:19.370> like

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
feel very vulnerable and they feel like

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.280 
feel very vulnerable and they feel like
it's<00:02:19.670> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.210> flare<00:02:20.510> up<00:02:20.540> their<00:02:20.810> condition

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
it's going to flare up their condition

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.710 
it's going to flare up their condition
which<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:22.370> can<00:02:22.730> completely<00:02:23.150> understand<00:02:23.600> that

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
which I can completely understand that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
which I can completely understand that
because<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.990> know<00:02:24.050> when<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.290> had<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> strain<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.880> I

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
because I know when I had a strain and I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.280 
because I know when I had a strain and I
was<00:02:26.090> wanting<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.390> play<00:02:26.510> baseball<00:02:26.720> again<00:02:27.049> it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
was wanting to play baseball again it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.960 
was wanting to play baseball again it
was<00:02:27.379> easier<00:02:27.769> for<00:02:27.799> me<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.129> sit<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.519> just<00:02:28.670> rest

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
was easier for me to sit and just rest

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.130 
was easier for me to sit and just rest
because<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.750> felt<00:02:29.959> like<00:02:30.019> that<00:02:30.140> was<00:02:30.519> safer

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
because I felt like that was safer

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.080 
because I felt like that was safer
but<00:02:32.440> after<00:02:33.250> reading<00:02:33.370> all<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.610> research<00:02:33.970> I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
but after reading all the research I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.790 
but after reading all the research I
related<00:02:34.360> change<00:02:34.630> my<00:02:34.810> mindset<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:35.680> going

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
related change my mindset if I was going

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.640 
related change my mindset if I was going
to<00:02:35.860> play<00:02:35.980> baseball<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.550> same<00:02:36.760> level<00:02:37.150> again

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
to play baseball the same level again

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.630 
to play baseball the same level again

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
the way we like to see how the body

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.990 
the way we like to see how the body
works<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.959> abides<00:02:59.500> by<00:02:59.620> a<00:03:00.010> rule<00:03:00.670> called<00:03:00.850> the

said principle and really all this means

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.370 
said principle and really all this means
is<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.030> descriptive<00:03:04.420> way<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.810> showing<00:03:05.230> how

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
is it's a descriptive way of showing how

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.260 
is it's a descriptive way of showing how
the<00:03:05.440> body<00:03:05.800> will<00:03:06.070> accommodate<00:03:06.640> two<00:03:06.760> loads<00:03:07.000> put

you that if your muscles and tendons

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.210 
you that if your muscles and tendons
have<00:03:35.019> been<00:03:35.200> damaged<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.950> then<00:03:36.040> been

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
have been damaged just and then been

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.009 
have been damaged just and then been
used<00:03:36.459> for<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.700> long<00:03:36.850> time<00:03:37.090> they<00:03:37.239> atrophy<00:03:37.720> or<00:03:37.750> get

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
used for a long time they atrophy or get

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.900 
used for a long time they atrophy or get
weaker<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.530> as<00:03:39.160> long<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.370> they're<00:03:39.670> weak

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
weaker and as long as they're weak

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.970 
weaker and as long as they're weak
they're<00:03:40.269> gonna<00:03:40.360> become<00:03:40.780> frail<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.620> more

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
they're gonna become frail and more

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.670 
they're gonna become frail and more
susceptible<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.579> injuries<00:03:43.060> again<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.200> people

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
susceptible to injuries again so people

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.319 
susceptible to injuries again so people
always<00:03:44.799> wonder<00:03:44.980> why<00:03:45.220> injuries<00:03:45.640> happen<00:03:46.000> again

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
always wonder why injuries happen again

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.000 
always wonder why injuries happen again
and<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.750> lot<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:46.959> times<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.590> because<00:03:47.739> they

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
and a lot of times it's because they

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.410 
and a lot of times it's because they
haven't<00:03:48.160> print<00:03:48.400> properly<00:03:48.640> rehabbed<00:03:49.239> or

haven't print properly rehabbed or

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.990 
haven't print properly rehabbed or
strengthened<00:03:49.900> after<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.530> fact<00:03:50.769> now<00:03:51.640> we<00:03:51.670> can

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
strengthened after the fact now we can

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.699 
strengthened after the fact now we can
whereas<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.360> lot<00:03:52.600> of<00:03:52.720> them<00:03:52.840> will<00:03:52.959> think<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.380> if

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
whereas a lot of them will think that if

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.039 
whereas a lot of them will think that if
they<00:03:54.040> get<00:03:54.190> injured<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.579> Sunday<00:03:55.090> if<00:03:55.540> they<00:03:55.780> rest

they get injured on Sunday if they rest

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.960 
they get injured on Sunday if they rest
the<00:03:56.170> entire<00:03:56.470> week<00:03:56.680> don't<00:03:57.010> move<00:03:57.340> don't<00:03:57.700> stretch

don't do anything of that nature and

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.930 
don't do anything of that nature and
just<00:03:59.350> take<00:03:59.620> some<00:03:59.769> medication<00:04:00.310> they're<00:04:00.850> gonna

this<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.769> terrible<00:04:06.130> plan<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.400> attack<00:04:06.489> in<00:04:06.760> my

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
this is a terrible plan of attack in my

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.490 
this is a terrible plan of attack in my
opinion<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.510> really<00:04:07.660> doesn't<00:04:07.870> abide<00:04:08.230> by<00:04:08.470> a

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
opinion and it really doesn't abide by a

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.620 
opinion and it really doesn't abide by a
lot<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.250> guidelines<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.450> see

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
lot of the guidelines that you can see

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.600 
lot of the guidelines that you can see
in<00:04:10.720> research<00:04:11.049> for<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.070> early<00:04:12.220> strength

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
in research for this early strength

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.509 
in research for this early strength
period<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.269> like<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.780> recommend<00:04:14.079> specific

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
period I like to recommend specific

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.920 
period I like to recommend specific
exercises<00:04:15.519> for<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.820> specific<00:04:16.359> conditions

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
exercises for the specific conditions

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.650 
exercises for the specific conditions
that<00:04:17.049> these<00:04:17.410> athletes<00:04:17.560> have<00:04:18.180> now<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.209> really

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
that these athletes have now I really

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.810 
that these athletes have now I really
like<00:04:19.870> EC<00:04:20.169> centric<00:04:20.950> contractions<00:04:21.549> or<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
like EC centric contractions or the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.300 
like EC centric contractions or the
lengthening<00:04:22.300> contractions<00:04:22.990> alright<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.160> and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
lengthening contractions alright you and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.710 
lengthening contractions alright you and
the<00:04:24.400> gym<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.910> lot<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.120> gym<00:04:25.300> goers<00:04:25.600> we're

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
the gym of a lot of gym goers we're

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.840 
the gym of a lot of gym goers we're
gonna<00:04:25.810> call<00:04:26.140> them<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.740> negatives<00:04:27.190> all<00:04:27.640> right

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
gonna call them the negatives all right

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.060 
gonna call them the negatives all right
these<00:04:28.600> exercises<00:04:29.380> have<00:04:29.440> been<00:04:29.500> shown<00:04:29.770> to

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
these exercises have been shown to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.740 
these exercises have been shown to
improve<00:04:30.220> strains<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.880> little<00:04:31.090> faster<00:04:31.479> than<00:04:31.660> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
improve strains a little faster than the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.779 
improve strains a little faster than the
isometric<00:04:32.200> or<00:04:32.620> concentric<00:04:33.160> holds<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.700> are

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
isometric or concentric holds that are

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.210 
isometric or concentric holds that are
typical<00:04:34.240> in<00:04:34.419> weight<00:04:34.690> training<00:04:34.870> now<00:04:35.710> you're

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
typical in weight training now you're

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.320 
typical in weight training now you're
probably<00:04:36.370> under<00:04:36.520> one<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.760> these<00:04:36.820> contractions

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
probably under one of these contractions

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.240 
probably under one of these contractions
you're<00:04:37.479> talking<00:04:37.720> about<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.380> don't<00:04:38.890> expect<00:04:39.130> you

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
you're talking about I don't expect you

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.909 
you're talking about I don't expect you
guys<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:40.000> all<00:04:40.270> right<00:04:40.419> but<00:04:40.690> all<00:04:41.289> you

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
guys to know this all right but all you

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.529 
guys to know this all right but all you
have<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.340> know<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.640> that<00:04:42.669> these<00:04:43.060> types<00:04:43.390> of

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
have to know is that these types of

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.620 
have to know is that these types of
lengthening<00:04:44.050> can<00:04:44.260> track

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
lengthening can track

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.450 
lengthening can track
which<00:04:44.930> can<00:04:45.320> be<00:04:45.440> put<00:04:45.620> together<00:04:45.740> by<00:04:46.190> someone

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
which can be put together by someone

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.400 
which can be put together by someone
like<00:04:46.670> me<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.180> good<00:04:47.660> strength<00:04:47.870> in<00:04:48.050> addition

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
like me a good strength in addition

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.800 
like me a good strength in addition
coach<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:48.980> on<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:50.150> makes<00:04:50.480> us<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.720> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
coach and so on it makes us to the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.050 
coach and so on it makes us to the
programs<00:04:51.230> better<00:04:51.620> for<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:52.370> less<00:04:52.760> chance

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
programs better for you it's less chance

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.490 
programs better for you it's less chance
of<00:04:53.240> flare-ups<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.720> know<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:53.960> my<00:04:54.080> personal

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
of flare-ups and I know in my personal

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.680 
of flare-ups and I know in my personal
experience<00:04:54.620> with<00:04:55.100> working<00:04:55.490> with<00:04:55.580> people

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
experience with working with people

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.720 
experience with working with people
there's<00:04:56.690> less<00:04:56.960> chance<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.380> dropout<00:04:57.950> or<00:04:58.190> the

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
there's less chance of dropout or the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.520 
there's less chance of dropout or the
people<00:04:59.000> will<00:04:59.120> comply<00:04:59.540> with<00:04:59.570> the<00:05:00.110> program<00:05:00.380> a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
people will comply with the program a

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.780 
people will comply with the program a
little<00:05:00.620> better<00:05:00.920> because<00:05:01.310> there's<00:05:01.550> less

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
little better because there's less

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.600 
little better because there's less

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
gonna put a link below this video so you

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.860 
gonna put a link below this video so you
guys<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:30.980> actually<00:05:31.550> see<00:05:32.000> that<00:05:32.150> there<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:32.840> a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
guys can actually see that there is a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.530 
guys can actually see that there is a
credible<00:05:33.140> source<00:05:33.410> in<00:05:33.620> this<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:33.860> he<00:05:33.950> can<00:05:34.100> get

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
credible source in this so he can get

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.510 
credible source in this so he can get
credit<00:05:35.540> for<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:35.750> as<00:05:35.810> well<00:05:36.190> but<00:05:37.190> he<00:05:37.280> was<00:05:37.340> on

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
credit for it as well but he was on

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.430 
credit for it as well but he was on
hamstrings<00:05:38.030> and<00:05:38.390> it<00:05:38.810> showed<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.080> difference

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
hamstrings and it showed a difference

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.480 
hamstrings and it showed a difference
between<00:05:39.770> again<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.100> shortening

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
between again the shortening

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.190 
between again the shortening
contractions<00:05:41.060> in<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.600> center<00:05:42.050> for

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
contractions in the center for

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.830 
contractions in the center for
lengthening<00:05:42.620> contractions<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.540> if<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.690> was

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
lengthening contractions and if I was

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.270 
lengthening contractions and if I was
going<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:45.020> quote<00:05:45.230> it<00:05:45.290> I<00:05:45.590> would<00:05:45.710> say<00:05:45.920> that<00:05:46.100> they

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
going to quote it I would say that they

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.430 
going to quote it I would say that they
had<00:05:46.550> they<00:05:47.510> said<00:05:47.660> in<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:47.840> conclusion<00:05:48.290> that

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
had they said in the conclusion that

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.710 
had they said in the conclusion that
there's<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.830> significant<00:05:49.400> decrease<00:05:50.180> in<00:05:50.210> chance

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
there's a significant decrease in chance

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.440 
there's a significant decrease in chance
of<00:05:50.960> hamstring<00:05:51.440> strains<00:05:51.920> if<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:53.120> did<00:05:53.270> the

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
of hamstring strains if you did the

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.930 
of hamstring strains if you did the
eccentric<00:05:53.990> exercise<00:05:54.760> personally<00:05:55.760> I<00:05:55.820> think

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
eccentric exercise personally I think

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.460 
eccentric exercise personally I think
that's<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.420> significant<00:05:56.960> finding<00:05:57.320> there's

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
that's a significant finding there's

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.810 
that's a significant finding there's
lots<00:05:57.650> of<00:05:57.770> research<00:05:58.100> out<00:05:58.280> there<00:05:58.430> like<00:05:58.610> this

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
lots of research out there like this

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.610 
lots of research out there like this
these<00:05:59.000> are<00:05:59.150> just<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.420> couple<00:05:59.450> of<00:05:59.840> them<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.470> go

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
these are just a couple of them so go

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.870 
these are just a couple of them so go
ahead<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:00.890> do<00:06:00.950> your<00:06:01.040> due<00:06:01.160> diligence<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.820> you

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
ahead and do your due diligence and you

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.460 
ahead and do your due diligence and you
can<00:06:02.000> find<00:06:02.240> a<00:06:02.330> lot<00:06:02.450> of<00:06:02.480> these<00:06:02.570> things<00:06:02.810> on<00:06:02.990> PubMed

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
can find a lot of these things on PubMed

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.250 
can find a lot of these things on PubMed
or<00:06:03.500> Medscape<00:06:04.810> next<00:06:05.810> video<00:06:05.990> we're<00:06:06.080> going<00:06:06.200> to

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
or Medscape next video we're going to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.870 
or Medscape next video we're going to
jump<00:06:06.440> right<00:06:06.620> into<00:06:06.800> what<00:06:07.160> we<00:06:07.280> like<00:06:07.430> to<00:06:07.580> call<00:06:07.760> the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
jump right into what we like to call the

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.850 
jump right into what we like to call the
mid<00:06:08.090> strength<00:06:08.450> period<00:06:08.840> and<00:06:09.170> this<00:06:09.410> is<00:06:09.560> roughly

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
mid strength period and this is roughly

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.530 
mid strength period and this is roughly
from<00:06:09.950> about<00:06:10.040> six<00:06:10.490> weeks<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.940> ten<00:06:11.150> weeks<00:06:11.330> after

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
from about six weeks to ten weeks after

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.510 
from about six weeks to ten weeks after
the<00:06:11.750> point<00:06:11.930> of<00:06:12.050> injury<00:06:12.200> so<00:06:13.070> I<00:06:13.100> think<00:06:13.190> you<00:06:13.370> guys

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
the point of injury so I think you guys

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.370 
the point of injury so I think you guys
can<00:06:13.700> see<00:06:13.910> that<00:06:13.940> actually<00:06:14.180> that<00:06:14.780> if<00:06:15.170> you're

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
can see that actually that if you're

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.780 
can see that actually that if you're
more<00:06:15.590> than<00:06:15.710> a<00:06:15.770> month<00:06:15.920> removed<00:06:16.400> from<00:06:16.580> the

more than a month removed from the

original point of injury that your wall
behind<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.820> curve<00:06:20.090> of<00:06:20.270> what<00:06:20.420> you<00:06:20.600> should<00:06:20.660> have

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
behind the curve of what you should have

yet if you've only been resting there's

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.450

been doing and don't get me wrong you

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.160
