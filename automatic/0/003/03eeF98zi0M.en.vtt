semicircle if you've got a fretsaw a
bandsaw<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.860> quickly<00:02:47.459> did<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.909> on<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
bandsaw I quickly did this on the

bandsaw I quickly did this on the
bandsaw<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.099> quite<00:02:50.370> tight<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:50.849> I

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
bandsaw and this is quite tight so I

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.420 
bandsaw and this is quite tight so I
took<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> out<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.510> sections<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.220> don't

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
took it out in sections but if you don't

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.780 
took it out in sections but if you don't
own<00:02:53.670> any<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:53.970> those<00:02:54.150> things<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:55.079> coping<00:02:55.590> saw<00:02:55.920> or

make<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.820> look<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.150> bit<00:03:47.180> decorative<00:03:47.900> I'm<00:03:48.080> gonna

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
make it look a bit decorative I'm gonna

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.760 
make it look a bit decorative I'm gonna
cut<00:03:49.580> round<00:03:49.880> there<00:03:51.340> down<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.370> there<00:03:53.590> make<00:03:54.590> it

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
cut round there down to there make it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:03.460 
cut round there down to there make it
look<00:03:54.890> uniform<00:03:55.280> something<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.210> this<00:04:02.470> roughly

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
look uniform something like this roughly

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.840 
look uniform something like this roughly
like<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.240> so<00:04:05.240> you<00:04:05.300> can<00:04:05.480> paint<00:04:05.750> all<00:04:06.020> that<00:04:06.230> out

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
like so so you can paint all that out

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.760 
like so so you can paint all that out
cut<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.030> off<00:04:08.150> with<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:08.360> saw<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.990> then<00:04:09.260> sand<00:04:09.590> it

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
cut it off with a saw and then sand it

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.470 
cut it off with a saw and then sand it
all<00:04:09.950> around

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.090 

and<00:04:14.480> here<00:04:14.810> I'm<00:04:14.960> just<00:04:15.140> banned<00:04:15.560> sawed<00:04:15.860> it

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
and here I'm just banned sawed it

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.370 
and here I'm just banned sawed it
roughly<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.670> shape<00:04:16.910> very<00:04:17.510> roughly<00:04:17.959> as<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.200> can

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
roughly to shape very roughly as you can

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.870 
roughly to shape very roughly as you can
see<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.940> now<00:04:20.090> I'll<00:04:20.209> just<00:04:20.420> sand<00:04:20.690> off<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:20.930> edges

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
see and now I'll just sand off the edges

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.280 
see and now I'll just sand off the edges
you<00:04:22.880> might<00:04:23.090> like<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.540> choose<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.840> different

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
you might like to choose a different

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.710 
you might like to choose a different
shape<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.740> dowel<00:04:27.980> for<00:04:28.010> my<00:04:28.580> intern<00:04:28.970> instrument

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
shape the dowel for my intern instrument

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.590 
shape the dowel for my intern instrument
is<00:04:29.900> 14<00:04:30.410> inches<00:04:30.860> long<00:04:31.000> you'll<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.330> bury

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
is 14 inches long you'll have to bury

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.380 
is 14 inches long you'll have to bury
this<00:04:32.870> come<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.380> yours<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:33.950> should<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.340> a

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.940 

pretty<00:04:38.390> good<00:04:38.540> cap<00:04:39.050> fit<00:04:42.910> so<00:04:43.910> it's<00:04:44.030> flush<00:04:44.950> if

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
pretty good cap fit so it's flush if

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.580 
pretty good cap fit so it's flush if
it's<00:04:46.160> too<00:04:46.490> tight<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:47.330> simply<00:04:47.690> sand<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.440> end

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
it's too tight just simply sand the end

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.510 
it's too tight just simply sand the end
of<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.830> doubt<00:04:49.070> or<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.430> fits<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.919> if<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.220> too

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
of the doubt or it fits and if it's too

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.150 
of the doubt or it fits and if it's too
loose<00:04:52.790> just<00:04:53.360> simply<00:04:53.690> put<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.900> saw<00:04:54.169> cut<00:04:54.500> down<00:04:54.950> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
loose just simply put a saw cut down the

up<00:06:04.930> to<00:06:04.960> you<00:06:05.430> I'm<00:06:06.430> going<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:06.729> take<00:06:06.939> the<00:06:07.180> easy

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
up to you I'm going to take the easy

up to you I'm going to take the easy
approach<00:06:07.779> I'm<00:06:08.020> just<00:06:08.199> going<00:06:08.319> to<00:06:08.349> put<00:06:08.529> a<00:06:08.559> bit<00:06:08.740> of

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
approach I'm just going to put a bit of

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.389 
approach I'm just going to put a bit of
wax<00:06:09.039> on<00:06:09.309> it<00:06:10.529> because<00:06:11.529> this<00:06:11.680> is<00:06:11.860> quite<00:06:12.189> nice

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
wax on it because this is quite nice

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.959 
wax on it because this is quite nice
wood<00:06:12.809> and<00:06:13.809> you<00:06:14.020> see<00:06:14.319> how<00:06:14.469> it<00:06:14.620> will<00:06:14.740> come<00:06:14.889> up<00:06:14.969> so

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
wood and you see how it will come up so

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.730 
wood and you see how it will come up so
I'm<00:06:16.059> just<00:06:16.210> gonna<00:06:16.330> run<00:06:16.629> some<00:06:16.839> wax<00:06:17.080> around<00:06:17.620> the

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
I'm just gonna run some wax around the

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.899 
I'm just gonna run some wax around the
thing<00:06:22.110> avoiding<00:06:23.110> as<00:06:23.379> much<00:06:23.439> wax<00:06:24.009> as<00:06:24.370> possible

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
thing avoiding as much wax as possible

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.899 
thing avoiding as much wax as possible
on<00:06:24.999> these<00:06:25.409> surfaces<00:06:26.409> as<00:06:27.310> I'm<00:06:27.520> going<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:27.759> put<00:06:27.879> a

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
on these surfaces as I'm going to put a

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.730 
on these surfaces as I'm going to put a
little<00:06:28.029> bit<00:06:28.180> of<00:06:28.300> felt<00:06:28.539> on<00:06:28.719> there<00:06:28.990> and<00:06:29.229> on<00:06:29.589> the

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
little bit of felt on there and on the

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.800 
little bit of felt on there and on the
inside<00:06:30.129> here<00:06:30.580> to<00:06:30.789> protect<00:06:30.969> the<00:06:31.270> instrument

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
inside here to protect the instrument

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.969 
inside here to protect the instrument
but<00:06:33.839> you<00:06:34.839> can<00:06:34.990> see<00:06:35.199> it's<00:06:35.379> quite<00:06:35.589> simple<00:06:37.979> wax

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
but you can see it's quite simple wax

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.020 
but you can see it's quite simple wax
the<00:06:39.189> whole<00:06:39.370> thing

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:53.549 

well<00:06:44.030> I'm<00:06:44.180> sure<00:06:44.420> you've<00:06:44.600> got<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:44.900> idea

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:53.559 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:07:13.440 

no<00:06:54.219> I<00:06:54.249> just<00:06:54.489> finished<00:06:54.879> this<00:06:55.209> off

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.860 

if<00:07:13.810> you<00:07:14.140> have<00:07:14.320> a<00:07:14.430> larger<00:07:15.430> ukulele<00:07:16.390> or<00:07:16.420> perhaps

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
if you have a larger ukulele or perhaps

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.020 
if you have a larger ukulele or perhaps
a<00:07:17.460> banjo<00:07:18.460> or<00:07:18.880> guitar<00:07:20.160> just<00:07:21.160> simply<00:07:21.490> scale<00:07:21.850> it

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
a banjo or guitar just simply scale it

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:32.970 
a banjo or guitar just simply scale it
to<00:07:22.210> size

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:32.980 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.040
