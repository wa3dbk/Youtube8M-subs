00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello hi hello how are you I hope 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 be very good and I'm very good this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.440
 video is a sequence to the other video that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.630
 I went up only then teach how it is that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 I hit the pebbles there in the face 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.830
 because they tell me how you hit them and not 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.980
 you fall sweats and everything in you do not fall 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.010
 already when it gives us a lot yes but I use 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.020
 tab records and it's pretty easy what 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.470
 only thing they are going to do is 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.130
 they are going to paint a painter where they want 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.100
 stick 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.620
 [Music] 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.289
 and you can do any design 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.100
 pattern that you like do not have to 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.100
 follow the member 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.239
 I love everything that shines something much 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.090
 at the beginning it puts me with many points 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.020
 because it took me 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.790
 now I only wear no more than 15 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 points something like that because I have to 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.830
 be aware and stick the crystals 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.560
 they put it on 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 try not to put these drops very 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 full as the first one is there you see 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.080
 the time to press everything is done 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.009
 the sides then what do they want 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.009
 cleaner nothing more 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.620
 [Music] 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.250
 that is to say this phenomenon that very well 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.659
 while it's cool you know what 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.060
 they can move to go wherever they want 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.450
 and patience I think it depends 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450
 so much 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.620
 how much material do you want to paste in 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.729
 his face but because there are so 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.729
 [Music] 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.890
 there is more close to the street about 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.890
 since the camera was closer 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.320
 of these stones are acrylics 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.229
 order by ebay I have also used this one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.179
 the expensive expensive but this is the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 Acrylic does not weigh the same effect 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.340
 but they can also use 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.880
 which is cut glass so is the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.610
 little bag and so it came to me it does not look like that 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.260
 order is and it came and supposedly it 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.720
 called ere crystal 5 millimeters or 2000 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 5 millimeters is the measure of the pebble 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:42.069
 sometimes says sold 20 s s ss 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.300
 another number comes being the 20 is the one that 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.790
 I like it because it is not too big 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:51.700
 very small but it was like 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.959
 without corroborating this feet I do not remember 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.150
 but I think cheaper do not get scared 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.890
 once they come back from the bar or 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.580
 where they have to work one hour of 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.530
 class then you makeup 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.040
 they are removed one by one which was the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.530
 receiver of the tab take it off to the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 trash and the dog are using it again 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.840
 [Music] 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:21.289
 but I stopped 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.289
