00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
catted UEL header and we actually just

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850 
catted UEL header and we actually just
dropped<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.450> last<00:00:42.450> night<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.960> release<00:00:43.260> I've

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
did release our catalyst header actually

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.610 
did release our catalyst header actually
before<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:57.440> just<00:00:58.440> same<00:00:59.010> same<00:00:59.460> design<00:00:59.820> same

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
before that just same same design same

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
before that just same same design same

handmade here in the US right here in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.010 
handmade here in the US right here in
Iowa<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.509> 4-4-2<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.750> merged

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.480 
Iowa and it's a 4-4-2 one merged
collector<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> 2.5<00:01:18.450> inch

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
collector here and then a 2.5 inch

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.880 
collector here and then a 2.5 inch
outlet<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.180> over<00:01:21.630> pipe<00:01:21.840> side<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.500> then

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
outlet on the over pipe side and then

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.429 
outlet on the over pipe side and then
obviously<00:01:23.240> no<00:01:24.240> high<00:01:24.420> flow<00:01:24.630> cat<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
obviously no high flow cat so that is

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
obviously no high flow cat so that is
just<00:01:25.590> straightforward<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> there

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
just straightforward for you there

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.469 
just straightforward for you there
runner<00:01:28.530> diameter<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> three-quarter

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
runner diameter is one in three-quarter

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
runner diameter is one in three-quarter
inches<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:32.420> pretty<00:01:33.420> much<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> same<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.960> our

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
inches and pretty much the same as our

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.980 
inches and pretty much the same as our
cat<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.770> header<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.220> without<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> cat<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
cat and header but without a cat so it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.870 
cat and header but without a cat so it's
another<00:01:37.170> option<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.770> guys<00:01:37.979> who<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
another option for you guys who don't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
another option for you guys who don't
really<00:01:39.600> care<00:01:39.720> about<00:01:39.810> emissions<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.799> really

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
really care about emissions don't really

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
really care about emissions don't really
care<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.189> noise<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:44.149> want<00:01:45.149> same<00:01:45.960> quality

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
care about noise and want same quality

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
care about noise and want same quality
and<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.490> cheaper<00:01:47.670> price<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.299> we'll

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and for a little cheaper price so we'll

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.179 
and for a little cheaper price so we'll
be<00:01:48.990> able<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.290> rid<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> torque<00:01:49.950> dip

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
be able to get rid of that torque dip

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.270 
be able to get rid of that torque dip
and<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.500> horsepower<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.740> top<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and get some horsepower up top for you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
and get some horsepower up top for you
as<00:01:53.399> well<00:01:53.659> another<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:55.020> option<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
as well another little option here is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.429 
as well another little option here is
you<00:01:55.770> probably<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.689> we<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:57.869> added<00:01:58.170> an

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you probably see is we actually added an

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
you probably see is we actually added an
extra<00:01:58.680> o2<00:01:59.040> bung<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.820> as<00:01:59.909> well<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.630> any

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
extra o2 bung up here as well for any

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.209 
extra o2 bung up here as well for any
wideband<00:02:01.200> applications<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> you're

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
wideband applications that you're

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.060 
wideband applications that you're
looking<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.939> well<00:02:03.860> those<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:04.979> about

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
looking to do as well those are about

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.789 
looking to do as well those are about
all<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> talking<00:02:06.149> points<00:02:06.450> again<00:02:06.719> same<00:02:07.259> great

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
all the talking points again same great

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
all the talking points again same great
design<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.429> our<00:02:08.849> catted<00:02:09.239> UEL<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:10.170> rid<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
design as our catted UEL get rid of that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.490 
design as our catted UEL get rid of that
torque<00:02:10.860> dip<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.599> call<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.780> day

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
torque dip and call it a day

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
torque dip and call it a day
so<00:02:13.710> right<00:02:14.070> now<00:02:14.220> we're<00:02:14.370> gonna<00:02:14.490> go<00:02:14.700> take<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> car

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
so right now we're gonna go take the car

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.150 
so right now we're gonna go take the car
outside<00:02:15.960> we'll<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.290> some<00:02:16.500> stationary<00:02:16.950> revs

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
outside we'll do some stationary revs

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.650 
outside we'll do some stationary revs
for<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> guys<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:18.150> see<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.600> like

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
for you guys to see what it's like
