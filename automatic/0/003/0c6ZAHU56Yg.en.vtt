that<00:01:18.409> it's<00:01:18.530> built<00:01:18.770> really<00:01:19.159> light<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.299> it's

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
that it's built really light so it's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.980 
that it's built really light so it's
very<00:01:20.690> responsive<00:01:21.470> from<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.740> very<00:01:21.920> light<00:01:22.070> touch

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
one thing that it also does is that it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.420 
one thing that it also does is that it
vibrates<00:01:26.600> well<00:01:26.840> that's<00:01:27.799> what<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.070> lightness

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
vibrates well that's what the lightness
