00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
I call this positive side and call this

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.869 

the<00:00:49.989> only<00:00:50.199> front<00:00:50.589> side<00:00:51.149> moves<00:00:52.149> I<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.940> see

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the only front side moves I don't see

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:06.360 
the only front side moves I don't see
good<00:00:57.879> reasoning<00:00:58.870> for<00:00:59.170> this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.720 

let's<00:01:07.060> change<00:01:08.880> inside<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.090> can<00:01:10.330> see<00:01:11.730> metal

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.230 

it<00:01:28.240> fits<00:01:28.630> perfectly<00:01:31.650> different<00:01:32.650> side<00:01:33.220> moving

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:59.270 

and<00:01:40.440> this<00:01:41.610> makes<00:01:42.610> gap<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:45.490> very<00:01:45.700> good<00:01:48.840> why

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.969 

maybe<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:02.190> are<00:02:02.369> some<00:02:02.400> reason<00:02:03.000> far<00:02:03.299> griever

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
maybe there are some reason far griever

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:12.850 
maybe there are some reason far griever
should<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:07.260> good<00:02:07.680> reason<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.729> I

just the handle to the White position

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:27.559 
just the handle to the White position
something<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.200> made<00:02:21.319> anyway<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:26.569> was

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
something like that made anyway I was

scale to the time Apache I me and I felt

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
scale to the time Apache I me and I felt
a<00:03:46.820> hot<00:03:47.630> spot<00:03:47.900> here<00:03:48.730> during<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.940> strong<00:03:50.300> push

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
a hot spot here during a strong push

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.600 
a hot spot here during a strong push
hard<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:53.140> said<00:03:54.140> in<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.410> previous<00:03:54.739> field<00:03:55.190> video

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
hard I said in the previous field video

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.370 
hard I said in the previous field video
this<00:03:56.540> portion<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.530> thing<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:59.050> is<00:04:00.050> the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
this portion is thing and that is the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:09.300 
this portion is thing and that is the
reason<00:04:00.410> for<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.190> hot<00:04:01.730> spot<00:04:02.060> making<00:04:05.650> but

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.870 

after<00:04:11.950> disassembling<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:14.570> hundred<00:04:15.050> I

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
after disassembling this hundred I

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.110 
after disassembling this hundred I
noticed<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:17.120> big<00:04:17.299> issue<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:19.549> hannah<00:04:19.820> doesn't

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
noticed a big issue this hannah doesn't

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.600 
noticed a big issue this hannah doesn't
make<00:04:20.600> any<00:04:20.930> hot<00:04:21.380> spot<00:04:21.650> aren't<00:04:21.859> here<00:04:24.400> there<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.580> a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
make any hot spot aren't here there is a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.440 
make any hot spot aren't here there is a
reason<00:04:26.560> when<00:04:27.560> push<00:04:27.950> cut<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.790> blade<00:04:29.060> takes

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
reason when push cut the blade takes

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.670 
reason when push cut the blade takes
this<00:04:29.900> direction<00:04:30.650> or<00:04:31.010> power<00:04:31.430> then<00:04:32.419> this<00:04:33.410> is<00:04:33.650> the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
this direction or power then this is the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.150 
this direction or power then this is the
axis<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:36.470> last<00:04:37.100> spring<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.520> push<00:04:38.060> back<00:04:39.160> knee

axis then last spring a push back knee
handle<00:04:41.830> cut<00:04:42.830> push<00:04:43.669> back<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.720> this<00:04:45.140> portion

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
handle cut push back that this portion

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.450 
handle cut push back that this portion
is<00:04:45.710> important<00:04:47.140> therefore<00:04:48.140> this<00:04:48.950> portion

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
is important therefore this portion

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.760 
is important therefore this portion
doesn't<00:04:50.210> take<00:04:50.479> a<00:04:51.370> strong<00:04:52.370> pressure<00:04:53.560> from<00:04:54.560> this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
doesn't take a strong pressure from this

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.790 
doesn't take a strong pressure from this
push<00:04:55.130> cut<00:04:57.580> but<00:04:58.580> in<00:04:59.090> this<00:04:59.270> case<00:04:59.510> this<00:05:00.260> portion

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
push cut but in this case this portion

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.180 
push cut but in this case this portion
takes<00:05:01.280> strong<00:05:01.640> power<00:05:01.940> because<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:03.440> anti

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
takes strong power because this anti

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:15.940 
takes strong power because this anti
power<00:05:04.460> with<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:06.110> last<00:05:06.470> two<00:05:06.710> fingers<00:05:06.979> is<00:05:08.169> weak

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950
