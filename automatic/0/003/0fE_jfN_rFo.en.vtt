there's no right angles anywhere in the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
there's no right angles anywhere in the
design<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:59.009> make<00:01:59.130> sure<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> does<00:01:59.610> look<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.909> an

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
wheel arches which looks quite cool and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
wheel arches which looks quite cool and
that<00:02:04.229> runs<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.649> side<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.189> well<00:02:05.340> there's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
that runs up the side as well there's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.719 
that runs up the side as well there's
also<00:02:06.450> 200<00:02:07.439> millimeters<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> ground<00:02:08.550> clearance

also 200 millimeters of ground clearance

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
also 200 millimeters of ground clearance
which<00:02:09.270> puts<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> about<00:02:09.780> 10<00:02:10.140> 10<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.560> as

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
capture but not necessarily blown away

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.640 
capture but not necessarily blown away
how<00:03:25.970> does<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.240> 2008<00:03:26.810> fair<00:03:27.050> from<00:03:27.260> behind<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
how does the 2008 fair from behind the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.980 
how does the 2008 fair from behind the
wheel<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.910> know<00:03:29.030> /<00:03:29.270> Joe's<00:03:29.480> trick<00:03:29.750> with<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
wheel you know / Joe's trick with the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.630 
wheel you know / Joe's trick with the
turret<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:30.560> they<00:03:30.650> gave<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:31.100> really<00:03:31.310> small

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
turret but they gave it a really small

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.100 
turret but they gave it a really small
steering<00:03:32.060> wheel<00:03:32.210> to<00:03:32.330> kind<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.510> make<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.720> feel

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
steering wheel to kind of make it feel

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.590 
steering wheel to kind of make it feel
agile<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:33.890> sporty<00:03:34.340> well<00:03:34.940> that's<00:03:35.480> exactly

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
agile and sporty well that's exactly

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.300 
agile and sporty well that's exactly
what<00:03:35.930> they've<00:03:36.050> done<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.440> 2008<00:03:37.040> as<00:03:37.160> well

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
what they've done in the 2008 as well

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.730 
what they've done in the 2008 as well
and<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.670> kind<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:37.970> has<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.270> same<00:03:38.450> effect

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
and it kind of has the same effect

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.720 
and it kind of has the same effect
obviously<00:03:39.740> not<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.070> same<00:03:40.220> extent<00:03:40.610> because

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
obviously not to the same extent because

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.390 
obviously not to the same extent because
this<00:03:41.270> is<00:03:41.510> more<00:03:41.960> of<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.170> high-riding<00:03:42.590> SUV<00:03:43.100> model

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
this is more of a high-riding SUV model

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.270 
this is more of a high-riding SUV model
after<00:03:43.790> all<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.180> all<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.560> kind<00:03:45.770> of<00:03:45.800> responses

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
after all and all the kind of responses

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.920 
after all and all the kind of responses
feel<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.730> little<00:03:46.940> bit<00:03:47.120> slower<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.660> there's<00:03:47.900> a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
feel a little bit slower and there's a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.630 
feel a little bit slower and there's a
little<00:03:48.080> bit<00:03:48.260> more<00:03:48.440> body<00:03:48.590> roll<00:03:48.950> but<00:03:49.460> it's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
little bit more body roll but it's

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.550 
little bit more body roll but it's
actually<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:50.270> too<00:03:50.330> bad<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.990> corners<00:03:51.380> and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
actually not too bad in the corners and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.220 
actually not too bad in the corners and
the<00:03:51.700> ride<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.330> little<00:03:53.600> bit<00:03:53.690> improved<00:03:53.990> over

the two away as well as far as engines

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.360 
the two away as well as far as engines
are<00:03:56.480> concerned<00:03:56.870> most<00:03:57.680> important<00:03:58.100> ones<00:03:58.250> are

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
are concerned most important ones are

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.060 
are concerned most important ones are

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
that you still get quite a fair amount

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.460 
that you still get quite a fair amount
of<00:04:48.000> kit<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.449> you<00:04:48.509> get<00:04:48.690> my<00:04:49.199> new<00:04:49.229> air

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
of kit so you get my new air

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.320 
of kit so you get my new air
conditioning<00:04:50.039> you<00:04:50.280> get<00:04:50.460> electric<00:04:50.940> windows

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
conditioning you get electric windows

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.270 
conditioning you get electric windows
and<00:04:51.599> you<00:04:51.660> get<00:04:51.810> cruise<00:04:52.050> control<00:04:52.500> but<00:04:53.099> it's

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
and you get cruise control but it's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.499 
and you get cruise control but it's
probably<00:04:53.460> worth<00:04:53.699> moving<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.240> one<00:04:54.389> of<00:04:54.449> the

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
probably worth moving up to one of the

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.779 
probably worth moving up to one of the

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
2008 for what does league thing so it

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.880
