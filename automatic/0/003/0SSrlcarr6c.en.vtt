00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.899
 here I am sorry for the face never evening 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.929
 I'm a little tired but I wanted to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.429
 make you this video is just right for 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.780
 Father's Day 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.940
 we had the chance to test 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 the dc 43 h matres or the newcomer in 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.609
 our home that we already love and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.529
 The Pope's best friend has arrived at 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 bring Father's Day what you want by now 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.539
 become his also because in others 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.309
 two to manage dyson then why 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.710
 you say 43 aka matres having already 10 62 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.329
 so meanwhile I'm allergic to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.829
 her husband also dust mites 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.030
 even to the data we have two dates therefore 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.579
 we wanted this brush that is on purpose 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 contained in the matres to aspirate i 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 mattresses all the padded furniture then i 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.789
 sofa cushions cover the piles where 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 our cats love to sleep here c is 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.680
 no notices of belletti that go 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.330
 get up from this brush e 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 especially however the allergens that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.090
 then they make us sneeze and he does it 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.680
 to stay and therefore since I don't have much 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.900
 time afford the amount 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 this is the big vacuum cleaner 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.790
 very comfortable because in any case as it is 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 see not at the base but on the plug that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.330
 you row here you recharge a power 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.820
 really incredible and you can clean your 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.290
 read we did the test indeed 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.140
 did the pope saw that anyway 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.600
 now it's his and he started to clean or 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.340
 anyway I have to say jokes aside from 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.170
 gladly did because it was anyway 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.710
 realized how practical it is from 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.570
 use 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.399
 so if you put all beds too 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 mattress and project made me 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.740
 look with incredible satisfaction 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.020
 because being the base here is transparent 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.540
 you can see everything that aspires and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.130
 all the powder has come out of it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.719
 you have cleaned your mattress 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.790
 you already have a list but here even more 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.380
 a very white powder is evident 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 thin those are all the cells 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.250
 death also of our skin that yes 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.649
 he deposits beautiful mater lines 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.910
 house and become food for the mites of the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.410
 powder 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.210
 this kiss has done it on purpose 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.610
 this brushes made on purpose is not 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.060
 salable except for something I care about 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.100
 to specify and that you will stay 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.520
 asking if it is possible to apply the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.070
 broom of 10 62 to a vacuum cleaner of the 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.740
 generally you can't do it because the tube 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.260
 that is, the brooms have a particular 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.480
 mechanism inside for which one does not 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.310
 they can apply to the courses that this 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.220
 is the reason why if you want purchased 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.470
 in the Lecce 62 then a laptop without 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.540
 thread but with a long broom 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.550
 you also have all the accessories then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.070
 there are in these little ones then the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 he also fucks a laptop but it's important 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.430
 it's not a broom so there 's not 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.320
 you will never apply you will never find 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.300
 the tube to put at least then now 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.800
 I don't know if in the future they will do it but for 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.350
 now it can't be done 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.320
 so this is different from the decided 62 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.540
 not just for the matres brush then 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.690
 for the mattresses we did the test 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.080
 in the car so my least worried 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.940
 of my husband and I said to myself but 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.770
 punishes the whole car a little 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.480
 really there it was incredible why 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.450
 however I honestly never got to myself 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.850
 it go down in the garage to clean with 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.130
 the big dyson the machine then 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.100
 this is very convenient with but you have it 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.350
 totally in charge everything you see 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.660
 during this video then the mattresses 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.880
 plush sofa the car and we have 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.120
 done with one charge and it wasn't 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.810
 still unloaded the power between this 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.240
 to say the deputy 62 in the basic power 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.880
 they are the same both have the key 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.880
 to increase power in power 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.459
 maximum says 62 is more powerful however a 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.250
 so it didn't seem to mean that 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.750
 obviously this is also powerful 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.700
 because they seem almost like a trade 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.820
 this were more powerful they went to 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.820
 look at the instructions as they all dash 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.320
 does not have the bag only has the filter from 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.540
 wash that content 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.190
 Here here it is the title that 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.400
 you have to disconnect and wash from time to time 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.400
 second clearly disappointed the others 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.590
 supplied brushes are the classic 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.840
 you are clear that what 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.960
 it would be a bar and in the corners of this one 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.840
 here that actually just brushes why 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.830
 is this without the hairs is this with 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.919
 the hair with which we clean employee 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.009
 in the must girl like it is not that the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.490
 mistreating rimini is treated as one 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.710
 resin 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.330
 but she really likes the selection of brushed 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.590
 the expansion of the basra I don't know why but 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.860
 you put on delete you blow 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.250
 so be another brush that is 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.289
 the first time I have this is that 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.240
 looks a little like that of the top app 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.190
 that I had shown in the other video 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.320
 however clearly straight therefore not at 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.720
 form we say to clean up the masses 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.669
 for lamp, however, and very soft 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.590
 i very comfortable to clean between the wires 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.900
 in the sky decoder the nintendo wii e 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.520
 all those things we say are very delicate 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.710
 that cannot be vacuumed with a 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.389
 high power but have these say 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.310
 this this very soft brush that 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.190
 however it explains everything and takes away the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.820
 dust that I can tell you you know 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.160
 that I love dyson and no to part apart 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.780
 let's say my total adoration e 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.050
 this brush that still makes the 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.210
 difference because it really is 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.370
 so convenient for people like me 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.220
 little time for maybe dedicated to 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.800
 dedicate the home to cleaning plush 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.400
 my mom how much stuff that votes fail 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.740
 I didn't believe this brush to go out 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.320
 really the best 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.320
 said all tyson forever hello hello
