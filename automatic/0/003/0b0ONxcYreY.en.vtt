00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
going again and very eager so it's going

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.190 
going again and very eager so it's going
to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> challenging<00:00:45.450> series<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.989> never

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to be a challenging series it's never

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.340

easy<00:00:46.410> playing<00:00:46.800> Sri<00:00:47.039> Lanka<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:48.480> Sri<00:00:48.539> Lanka<00:00:49.140> but

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
easy playing Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka but

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
easy playing Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka but
you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> talented<00:00:50.879> Indian<00:00:51.300> team
