00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.410

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:29.460
 It important to those who take the train from Well no major relationship 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.890
 The revision of the cherry blossoms will be done Today is a little bit serious talk seriously 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.770
 From I would like in a little Japanese economy referee Pau to 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 For a moment I will excerpt mandatory safety training for malicious bike driver 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:48.150
 The enforcement order of the revised Road Exchange Act included 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 Enforced June 1st, which was only a cabinet decision 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:59.260
 In the construction example, a total of 14 items such as a ship bewitching shop and signal neglect were defined as dangerous acts. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:06.159
 It's a good tower for comorbidity More than 2 times within 3 years 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:07.240
 Subjects in the whole country where snow Atsu has been offenders take the training issues outlook several hundred people a year 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.650
 That's right 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.770
 Yes it Well 14 item is it here 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.460
 Post-Innovation Insect Banned or 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.570
 Traffic division violation such as slowing violation in the hall 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.710
 Roadside pedestrian obstruction 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.710
 Circuit breaker is N Access to down the level crossing 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.350
 Obstruction of priority road traffic at large satin etc 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.310
 In Oso shop 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.930
 Right turn priority installer etc. 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:42.040
 Do not violate safety promotion duties at ring intersections 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.760
 Pedestrian jamming on the sidewalk 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.580
 Driving a bike without a brake 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:57.300
 Driving safely while driving while using a drunken cell phone 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.290
 The above is 14 items I think that there were a lot of bullion such as in these 14 items 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 But 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.810
 So I think that the scope of the crackdown is wide first 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 When an accident occurs 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:15.150
 It can be the target of the case that was using a mobile phone 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:20.040
 The driver is the perpetrator by marking the driving that causes the accident as a dangerous act 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.610
 It seems that the aim is to deter serious accidents, according to the police station 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.590
 First driver behind the law is behind police officer 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.910
 I received a warning 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 A traffic ticket will be issued if you do not follow 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.980
 If it does not become a large elimination of three or more high-touch courses 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:43.140
 You will be fined below the horse 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:49.470
 It is to decide hat contents for 3 hours and method by enforcement 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.950
 It seems that there are 93 fatal accidents by bicycle in 2013 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.970
 It seems that this ratio is very much displayed 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 Well that is the success of the much less revised Road Traffic Law place in it is done 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.670
 I think I might have become 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.790
 That is to say in a nutshell, it will be tougher than ever before 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.800
 It means that the crackdown will be severe, especially 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.670
 You either use the bicycles in commuting 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.270
 Please be really careful 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:24.830
 Even though I've been commuting ne a road bike by train 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:28.280
 Because there are a lot of people who are full of maintenance , it's easy to see if you just look at the package . 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:33.050
 I sleep very much course not seen it look a little 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.380
 I think that I understand that there will be much more 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.460
 For example, a bike with no brake attached 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.940
 Tteyuu may not have a bell or light or not with no About Reiki 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.060
 Ne 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.200
 It's a little different and you 'll see it right away 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.240
 If you're a pisty, let's put on the brakes well . 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.950
 Let 's put firmly but is please 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:03.220
 Because this road bike is attached to the sound installation of l is a duty because 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.690
 To serious talk today, please note that it is considered a poor maintenance of the person, such with at home 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.100
 Kedomo now 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.730
 Well about the Road Exchange Act revision is from June 1 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:19.400
 From super 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:25.009
 Let's keep firmly if you don't dare probably by the Road Traffic Act revision of the cat 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:30.990
 The voice of the police also thinks that movement becomes active, so firmly 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:35.910
 If there is a defect in it, it's a brake, so let's secure it. 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.110
 I'm looking forward to the next time because I want to talk about components next time 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.540
 Please talk 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:49.580
