00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.029
 Today I want to show you if you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.919
 a trout a freshly caught 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.230
 trout that comes from the pond fuller 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.769
 hour is the still flooded kitchens 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.839
 ready prepared the trout is still 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.710
 complete with a layer of mud 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.960
 overdrawn 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.689
 We have to remove that first and that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 we were with salt after that she becomes 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 except that is the alternative way 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.019
 felt it is just connected with work 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.870
 and now use it vigorously with it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.570
 This mucus dissolves if you have one 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 If you want to make trout blue you can do that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 of course not wash away because there has to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 but the mucus remains on it now 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 pays himself hard 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.340
 Sun will use pretty strong 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 and really do not save with the salt 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.730
 because the mucus is impaired 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.730
 of course, the taste 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:11.470
 that would be the side of us should now 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.660
 enough salt on it and now if this around 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.720
 put the other side too 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.720
 can 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.049
 that would be enough and let it be 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.430
 few minutes so act five minutes 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.159
 so that a bit of the mucus dissolves 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.979
 what we actually do is 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.780
 actually like a peeling and I do 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.280
 the first with a hand because if I 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.229
 to take the others yet 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.860
 then we do not see too much and 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:05.470
 We prepare the salt vigorously 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:09.850
 the roud and solve it 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.209
 mucus layer on really strong 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.209
 rub 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.430
 the page would ever feel okay 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.290
 one also in the finger 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 that is not so slippery anymore 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.850
 Just work with some pressure 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.170
 but not completely set, of course 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.210
 that would be as good as 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 done and now I feel that 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.090
 Attention so I do the water 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.670
 Of course cold water by no means 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.850
 take warm lukewarm water 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.410
 so now I feel that right 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.060
 Thoroughly off the salt 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.440
 bit with the salt still trusts rom 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:26.340
 then travel noticeably that's by far 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:28.950
 not so slippery would this be 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.650
 step done too we need now 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.560
 a really sharp knife something 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.790
 commanded that would be what I am here 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.180
 ideal and we do here in the after 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.880
 I would say what and say now 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:51.030
 Carefully cut it here 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:53.310
 between the rivers and not too deep 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.460
 dive in with the knife we ​​are allowed 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.810
 no injuries and cuts 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.500
 very much in front 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.470
 so far so pay attention that the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.690
 trout really completely cut open 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.500
 is that he is now cutting here yet 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.770
 okay then the step would be synonymous 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.890
 done and now comes the essential 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:21.060
 here we have a column that you can see 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:25.340
 here and you unite that cut it 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.380
 Here are the times from as far as below 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:34.770
 here that this is separated from each other 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.540
 is so from the side also here is that 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.850
 there you have to be careful on his 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.410
 because the fish must be more solid that 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.449
 I do not have to finnin 'the hand 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.159
 cuts 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.189
 that's a bit like florian bunde 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.050
 and so it is on disconnected now 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:54.069
 Let's go here with the knife here 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.409
 in between and look that throws us 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.409
 his come out here are already 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:04.240
 and separating here absolutely for that 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:07.060
 so wonderful and see you here 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.090
 yes even the git and there with the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.330
 finger in and now strong 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.330
 pull 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.900
 that does not look all that great 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.610
 so now that has been resolved on the head 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.770
 I'm trying even better now 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.339
 grab and then just like that here 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.339
 subject 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.039
 Traveling here is easy 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:39.150
 Just call it and call it this 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:43.360
 so have the gills removed here 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.050
 breast fins and now you can see here 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:53.039
 the dark the spinal cord 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:55.560
 because we cut now which is 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.689
 won blood is in there 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.689
 Of course everything has to go away 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.509
 Of course not great 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:10.229
 then we make the cold water 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:10.229
 and now we play everything here 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:24.970
 We do this from the top of the head 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:28.610
 down and yet , of course, flow from it 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.919
 i hope i could help you and 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.889
 my instructions maybe they were 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.710
 helpful for you and now it is 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.039
 Leave water to each person 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.830
 trout will be processed further 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:46.639
 is important for me to say too 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.990
 if there is a dead trout with respect 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.990
 deal with the animal
