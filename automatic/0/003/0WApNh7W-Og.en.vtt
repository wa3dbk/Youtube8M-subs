00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.470 

hi<00:00:01.140> today<00:00:01.500> let's<00:00:01.949> learn<00:00:02.220> how<00:00:02.480> exhaust

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi today let's learn how exhaust

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.380 
hi today let's learn how exhaust
scavenging<00:00:03.929> system<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.859> JCB<00:00:05.390> machine

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
scavenging system of a JCB machine

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.690 
scavenging system of a JCB machine
actually<00:00:06.569> works

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
actually works

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.839 
actually works
what<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.820> exhaust<00:00:09.300> scavenging<00:00:10.139> system<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.790> you

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
what is exhaust scavenging system so you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
what is exhaust scavenging system so you
can<00:00:12.000> see<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> air<00:00:12.570> filter<00:00:12.990> over<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
can see a air filter over here this is a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.129 
can see a air filter over here this is a
JCB<00:00:14.219> 3dx<00:00:14.670> machine<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> air

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
JCB 3dx machine and this is the air

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.070 
JCB 3dx machine and this is the air
filter<00:00:16.199> over<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.630> where<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
filter over here and this is where we

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.570 
filter over here and this is where we
suck<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> air<00:00:19.890> filter<00:00:20.250> from<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
suck on the air filter from the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.990 
suck on the air filter from the
atmosphere<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.230> let's<00:00:22.590> get<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> top<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
atmosphere so let's get to the top and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.670 
atmosphere so let's get to the top and
see<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.660> what's<00:00:25.019> happening<00:00:25.500> over<00:00:25.619> there<00:00:25.859> so

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
see it what's happening over there so

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.700 
see it what's happening over there so
this<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.859> where<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.849> actually<00:00:30.439> suck<00:00:31.439> there

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this is where we actually suck there

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
this is where we actually suck there
from<00:00:32.550> beneath<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.450> through<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.140> actually

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
from beneath here through here actually

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.459 
from beneath here through here actually
we<00:00:35.130> suck<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> air<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.390> enters<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.200> from

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
we suck the air and it enters here from

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.299 
we suck the air and it enters here from
that<00:00:37.620> Monsieur

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that Monsieur

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.139 
that Monsieur
and<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.860> enters<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.030> air

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and that actually enters of the air

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
and that actually enters of the air
filter<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.140> filtering<00:00:43.590> element<00:00:43.950> over

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
filter so we have filtering element over

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.510 
filter so we have filtering element over
here<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> been<00:00:45.239> given<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.020> inlet

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
here and it is been given into the inlet

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
here and it is been given into the inlet
manifold<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> engine<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.350> how

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
manifold of the engine so that's how

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
manifold of the engine so that's how
their<00:00:50.280> filter<00:00:50.670> supplies<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> air<00:00:51.360> into<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
their filter supplies the air into the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.160 
their filter supplies the air into the
inlet<00:00:51.930> manifold<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> red

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
inlet manifold so you can see a red

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
inlet manifold so you can see a red
coupling<00:00:55.170> over<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.520> hose<00:00:56.730> connecting

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
coupling over here and a hose connecting

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.080 
coupling over here and a hose connecting
from<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> air<00:00:58.260> filter<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.850> this

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
from the air filter and see where this

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
from the air filter and see where this
horse<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.660> being<00:01:00.899> directed<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.070> have

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
horse is being directed you can have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.329 
horse is being directed you can have
let's<00:01:03.059> follow<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> hose<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> see

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
let's follow the hose and you can see

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.500 
let's follow the hose and you can see
that<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:06.299> hose<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.070> entering<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.580> see

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that that hose is entering over here see

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.200 
that that hose is entering over here see
this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> force<00:01:10.260> coming<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> Africa

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
this is the force coming from the Africa

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.490 
this is the force coming from the Africa
and<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.740> comes<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> enters

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
and this also actually comes and enters

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
and this also actually comes and enters
the<00:01:16.500> exhaust<00:01:17.159> pipe<00:01:17.939> over<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.689> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the exhaust pipe over here so this is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.840 
the exhaust pipe over here so this is
going<00:01:19.110> towards<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.670> XO<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.909> why<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
going towards the XO so why we have a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.859 
going towards the XO so why we have a
connection<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> air<00:01:24.479> filter<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
connection from the air filter that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.870 
connection from the air filter that
means<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> pressure<00:01:25.500> coming<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
means the pressure coming from that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.520 
means the pressure coming from that
motor<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.420> raising<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> absolute<00:01:28.200> try<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
motor is raising the absolute try and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
motor is raising the absolute try and
why<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.220> connection<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> air

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
why we have this connection from the air

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.200 
why we have this connection from the air
filter<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.140> towards<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> XO<00:01:32.430> slab<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
filter and towards the XO slab so this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.410 
filter and towards the XO slab so this
is<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.710> XO<00:01:35.100> scavenging<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.939> happening

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
is what the XO scavenging is happening

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
is what the XO scavenging is happening
so<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.950> fuel<00:01:38.220> air<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.150> suck<00:01:39.450> from

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
so here the fuel air which we suck from

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
so here the fuel air which we suck from
that<00:01:40.020> most<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.909> some

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that most of you it might I have some

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.740 
that most of you it might I have some
dust<00:01:43.049> particles<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.570> kept<00:01:45.570> inside

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
dust particles which will be kept inside

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.530 
dust particles which will be kept inside
the<00:01:46.229> air<00:01:46.380> filter<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the air filter so now here we have a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.520 
the air filter so now here we have a
suction<00:01:48.930> happening<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> due<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:51.530> exhaust

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
suction happening and due to the exhaust

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.810 
suction happening and due to the exhaust
by<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> exhaust<00:01:53.369> valve<00:01:53.640> will<00:01:53.790> be

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
by because the exhaust valve will be

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.719 
by because the exhaust valve will be
throwing<00:01:54.600> their<00:01:54.780> gas<00:01:55.320> outside<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
throwing their gas outside so we have a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.780 
throwing their gas outside so we have a
suction<00:01:57.659> at<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.140> point<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.490> suction

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
suction at this point so this suction

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.630 
suction at this point so this suction
actually<00:02:00.360> helped<00:02:00.630> us<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.049> take<00:02:01.829> away<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
actually helped us to take away the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
actually helped us to take away the
impurities<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.450> air<00:02:03.630> filter<00:02:03.840> through

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
impurities from the air filter through

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.280 
impurities from the air filter through
this<00:02:04.439> source<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.369> sucks<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> air<00:02:06.899> from

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
this source so it sucks the air from

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.309 
this source so it sucks the air from
here<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.849> impurities<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.450> been<00:02:09.780> carried<00:02:10.110> by

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
here the impurities have been carried by

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.589 
here the impurities have been carried by
this<00:02:10.400> force<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.120> due<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
this force from here and due to the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.420 
this force from here and due to the
suction

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
suction

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.550 
suction
the<00:02:13.519> at<00:02:14.030> SourceFed<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:15.140> thrown<00:02:15.379> away

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the at SourceFed just thrown away

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.190 
the at SourceFed just thrown away
through<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.459> exhaust<00:02:16.879> pipe<00:02:17.599> towards

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
through the exhaust pipe towards

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.289 
through the exhaust pipe towards
atmosphere<00:02:18.829> so<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.370> exhaust<00:02:19.819> scavenging

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
atmosphere so this is exhaust scavenging

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.130 
atmosphere so this is exhaust scavenging
system<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.280> if<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.489> return<00:02:22.670> heat<00:02:23.659> flow<00:02:23.959> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
system and if they return heat flow is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.619 
system and if they return heat flow is
happening<00:02:24.879> towards<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.000> air<00:02:26.090> filter<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
happening towards the air filter it

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.509 
happening towards the air filter it
might<00:02:26.810> happen<00:02:27.019> through<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.439> horse<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.980> so

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
might happen through this horse on it so

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.190 
might happen through this horse on it so
this<00:02:28.730> horse<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.299> having<00:02:29.599> a<00:02:29.689> factor<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.049> safety

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
this horse is having a factor of safety

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.530 
this horse is having a factor of safety
of<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.709> hundred<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.129> seventy<00:02:32.470> degrees

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
of one hundred and seventy degrees

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.330 
of one hundred and seventy degrees
Celsius<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.569> what<00:02:35.989> happens<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:36.439> that<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.950> a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
Celsius so what happens is that if a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.259 
Celsius so what happens is that if a
hero<00:02:38.109> 170<00:02:39.109> comes<00:02:39.739> over<00:02:40.040> here<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.430> horse

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
hero 170 comes over here this horse

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.750 
hero 170 comes over here this horse
actually<00:02:41.689> melts<00:02:42.109> and<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:43.069> will<00:02:43.280> not<00:02:43.370> affect

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
actually melts and it will not affect

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.030 
actually melts and it will not affect
the<00:02:43.790> air<00:02:43.879> filter<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.659> safety<00:02:45.040> system

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the air filter so this is safety system

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.910 
the air filter so this is safety system
of<00:02:46.150> 170<00:02:47.470> degree<00:02:48.609> of<00:02:49.609> heat<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:51.319> be<00:02:51.470> only<00:02:51.590> taken

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
of 170 degree of heat can be only taken

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.589 
of 170 degree of heat can be only taken
by<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.099> force<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.790> melts<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.450> will

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
by this force so it melts and it will

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.009 
by this force so it melts and it will
not<00:02:53.720> allow<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.049> heat<00:02:55.010> coming<00:02:55.430> from<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
not allow the heat coming from the

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.580 
not allow the heat coming from the
exhaust<00:02:57.019> pipe<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.329> is<00:02:59.450> coming<00:02:59.659> it<00:03:00.319> will<00:03:00.500> not

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
exhaust pipe if it is coming it will not

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.050 
exhaust pipe if it is coming it will not
allow<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:00.980> end<00:03:01.220> up<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.519> air<00:03:01.609> filter<00:03:01.970> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
allow it to end up the air filter and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.330 
allow it to end up the air filter and
say<00:03:02.329> it's<00:03:02.480> there<00:03:02.689> so<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:03.950> what<00:03:04.220> an

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
say it's there so this is what an

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.000 
say it's there so this is what an
exhaust<00:03:04.840> scavenging<00:03:05.840> system<00:03:06.470> does<00:03:06.739> it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
exhaust scavenging system does it

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190 
exhaust scavenging system does it
purifies<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.760> air<00:03:07.790> filter<00:03:08.239> which<00:03:08.689> sucks<00:03:08.989> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
purifies the air filter which sucks the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.160 
purifies the air filter which sucks the
impurities<00:03:10.010> or<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.519> dust<00:03:10.790> particles<00:03:11.170> which

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
impurities or the dust particles which

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.899 
impurities or the dust particles which
is<00:03:12.200> collected<00:03:12.620> inside<00:03:12.980> they<00:03:13.189> are<00:03:13.220> filter<00:03:13.700> and

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
is collected inside they are filter and

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.460 
is collected inside they are filter and
which<00:03:14.299> is<00:03:14.480> thrown<00:03:14.750> away<00:03:14.900> towards<00:03:15.409> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
which is thrown away towards the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.460 
which is thrown away towards the
atmosphere<00:03:15.980> through<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:16.750> exhaust<00:03:17.750> pipe<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.440> I

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
atmosphere through the exhaust pipe so I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.979 
atmosphere through the exhaust pipe so I
believe<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.889> got<00:03:18.980> an<00:03:19.129> idea<00:03:19.400> about<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.989> this

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
believe you got an idea about the this

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.639 
believe you got an idea about the this
particular<00:03:21.410> system<00:03:21.560> thanks<00:03:22.160> for<00:03:22.310> listening
