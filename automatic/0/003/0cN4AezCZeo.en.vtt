table basically made out of obsidian the
obsidian<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.909> place<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.420> top<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
obsidian we will place over top of the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
obsidian we will place over top of the
engine<00:01:18.900> I'll<00:01:19.259> show<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:20.009> first<00:01:20.790> I'm

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
going to get a few buckets of force

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
going to get a few buckets of force
where<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.200> here<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
after we get the bunch of the force

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
after we get the bunch of the force
we're<00:01:32.549> also<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.450> few<00:01:34.110> force

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
we're also going to need a few force

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.840 
we're also going to need a few force
gems<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.130> we're<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> first

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
gems what we're going to do the first

gems what we're going to do the first
job<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> take<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> force

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
job is we're going to take the force

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
job is we're going to take the force
gems<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.680> we're<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> stick<00:01:38.490> them<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
gems and we're going to stick them in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
gems and we're going to stick them in
the<00:01:38.759> force<00:01:39.060> infuser<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.320> once<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.220> their

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the force infuser so once we get their

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.350 
the force infuser so once we get their
force<00:01:42.030> rod<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.110> our<00:01:43.490> obsidian<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.790> engine

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
force rod we get our obsidian our engine

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
force rod we get our obsidian our engine
placed<00:01:45.630> everything<00:01:45.990> down<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

placed everything down we're going to
take<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> block<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.909> city<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> stick<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
take the block of a city and stick it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.160 
take the block of a city and stick it
right<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.229> top<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> engine<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.170> once

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
right on top of the engine like so once

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.539 
right on top of the engine like so once
it's<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.470> top<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> engine<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.340> were<00:01:53.430> going

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it's on top of the engine you were going

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's on top of the engine you were going
to<00:01:53.579> take<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:54.000> force<00:01:54.270> rod<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.750> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to take your force rod and just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.840 
to take your force rod and just
right-click<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.490> did<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
right-click it just like we did at the

see your armor is going to make you a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.839 
see your armor is going to make you a
lot<00:03:29.260> faster<00:03:29.919> while<00:03:30.159> roaming<00:03:30.519> you're<00:03:30.609> on<00:03:30.729> the

lot faster while roaming you're on the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.909 
lot faster while roaming you're on the
map<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.359> that<00:03:31.930> makes<00:03:32.169> it<00:03:32.319> a<00:03:32.379> lot<00:03:32.500> easier<00:03:32.560> to

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
map and that makes it a lot easier to

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.250 
map and that makes it a lot easier to
get<00:03:33.310> from<00:03:33.609> one<00:03:33.639> place<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.389> another<00:03:34.690> point
