shears get started

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380 
shears get started
tensioning<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.859> usually<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> issue<00:00:23.759> when<00:00:24.359> we

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
tensioning is usually the issue when we

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.870 
tensioning is usually the issue when we
get<00:00:24.599> a<00:00:24.630> phone<00:00:24.900> call<00:00:24.929> and<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.310> happen<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
get a phone call and what will happen is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.179 
get a phone call and what will happen is
fiber<00:00:27.630> builds<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.050> under<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> Conor<00:00:28.589> often

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
fiber builds up under the Conor often

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.759 
fiber builds up under the Conor often
when<00:00:29.369> there's<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:30.119> enough<00:00:30.419> tension<00:00:30.839> so<00:00:31.529> Matt

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
when there's not enough tension so Matt

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.090 
when there's not enough tension so Matt
would<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.099> show<00:00:32.340> us<00:00:33.470> what<00:00:34.470> happens<00:00:34.620> with

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
would you show us what happens with

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
would you show us what happens with
proper<00:00:35.550> tension<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.180> without<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.860> if

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
proper tension and without and see if

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.070 
proper tension and without and see if
you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.250> demonstrate<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.960> you

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
you can demonstrate the way that you

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.230 
you can demonstrate the way that you
tension<00:00:40.350> properly<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> swing<00:00:42.060> of<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
tension properly with the swing of the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.860 
tension properly with the swing of the
body<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.630> here<00:00:42.990> okay<00:00:43.650> sure<00:00:44.400> yeah<00:00:44.750> when<00:00:45.750> we

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
body of the here okay sure yeah when we

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
body of the here okay sure yeah when we
have<00:00:46.050> proper<00:00:46.470> tension<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> make

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
have proper tension we're going to make

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.210 
have proper tension we're going to make
a<00:00:48.030> nice<00:00:48.330> easy<00:00:48.750> cut<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> shears<00:00:49.890> should

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
a nice easy cut the shears should

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.310 
a nice easy cut the shears should
actually<00:00:50.400> flow<00:00:51.030> through<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.570> alpaca<00:00:52.020> with

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
actually flow through the alpaca with

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
actually flow through the alpaca with
very<00:00:52.560> little<00:00:52.770> pressure<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.730> I'll<00:00:53.850> make<00:00:54.060> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
very little pressure and I'll make a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.960 
very little pressure and I'll make a
stroke<00:00:54.450> with<00:00:55.230> proper<00:00:55.680> tension<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.220> hand<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
stroke with proper tension on hand so

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:11.429 
stroke with proper tension on hand so
you<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.360> an<00:00:57.450> idea<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.200> like

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:17.489 

we're<00:01:12.039> at<00:01:12.219> a<00:01:12.249> nice<00:01:12.579> easy<00:01:13.149> cut<00:01:13.810> now<00:01:15.659> when<00:01:16.659> I<00:01:16.719> talk

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
we're at a nice easy cut now when I talk

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.709 
we're at a nice easy cut now when I talk
about<00:01:17.679> tension<00:01:18.219> there<00:01:18.640> there's<00:01:18.969> two<00:01:19.030> types<00:01:19.509> of

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
about tension there there's two types of

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.779 
about tension there there's two types of
tension<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.409> we<00:01:20.770> typically<00:01:21.159> talk<00:01:21.490> about

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
tension and we typically talk about

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.660 
tension and we typically talk about
startup<00:01:22.359> tension<00:01:22.869> first<00:01:23.399> startup<00:01:24.399> tension<00:01:24.909> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
startup tension first startup tension is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.779 
startup tension first startup tension is
kind<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.880> balance<00:01:28.390> or<00:01:28.659> working<00:01:29.640> within<00:01:30.640> a

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
kind of a balance or working within a

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.260 
kind of a balance or working within a
range<00:01:31.149> of<00:01:31.799> tightness<00:01:32.799> of<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.670> Komen<00:01:34.030> cutter

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
range of tightness of the Komen cutter

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
range of tightness of the Komen cutter
we<00:01:34.450> have<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.689> think<00:01:34.929> of<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.170> Cohen<00:01:35.500> cutter<00:01:35.740> as

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
we have to think of the Cohen cutter as

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.510 
we have to think of the Cohen cutter as
multiple<00:01:37.000> pairs<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.479> scissors<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
multiple pairs of scissors and the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.059 
multiple pairs of scissors and the
tension<00:01:40.030> actually<00:01:40.569> pushes<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.349> top<00:01:41.560> blade

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
tension actually pushes the top blade

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.429 
tension actually pushes the top blade
against<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> bottom<00:01:43.359> blade<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:43.869> that's<00:01:44.200> what

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
against the bottom blade and that's what

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.559 
against the bottom blade and that's what
makes<00:01:44.619> it<00:01:44.739> cut<00:01:45.009> when<00:01:45.969> you<00:01:46.060> first<00:01:46.270> put<00:01:46.539> a

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
makes it cut when you first put a

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.020 
makes it cut when you first put a
Coleman<00:01:46.959> cutter<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.379> my<00:01:47.500> machine<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.159> want<00:01:48.670> to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
Coleman cutter on my machine you want to

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.229 
Coleman cutter on my machine you want to
have<00:01:49.209> enough<00:01:49.569> tension<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:50.319> keep<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.640> comb<00:01:51.909> and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
have enough tension to keep the comb and

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.449 
have enough tension to keep the comb and
cutter<00:01:52.599> together<00:01:53.170> without<00:01:53.679> flying<00:01:54.189> off<00:01:54.429> the

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
cutter together without flying off the

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.580 
cutter together without flying off the
machine<00:01:54.969> but<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:55.509> don't<00:01:55.750> want<00:01:55.989> to<00:01:56.049> make<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.349> too

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
machine but we don't want to make it too

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.399 
machine but we don't want to make it too
tight<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.549> cause<00:01:57.759> excessive<00:01:58.569> heat<00:01:58.989> buildup

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
tight to cause excessive heat buildup

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.300 
tight to cause excessive heat buildup
and<00:01:59.649> doll-like<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.149> blades<00:02:01.420> quit<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.979> an

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and doll-like of the blades quit so an

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.309 
and doll-like of the blades quit so an
easy<00:02:03.489> way<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.819> do<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.239> is<00:02:04.719> just<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:05.079> hold<00:02:05.200> the

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
easy way to do that is just to hold the

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.969 
easy way to do that is just to hold the
machine<00:02:05.709> and<00:02:05.950> twist<00:02:07.019> the<00:02:08.019> tension<00:02:08.440> off<00:02:08.619> your

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
machine and twist the tension off your

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.170 
machine and twist the tension off your
finger<00:02:09.310> thumb<00:02:10.470> reach<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.650> point<00:02:11.920> where<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:13.000> can

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
finger thumb reach a point where you can

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.960 
finger thumb reach a point where you can
wiggle<00:02:13.329> the<00:02:13.569> machine<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:15.549> can<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.790> show<00:02:15.940> us

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
wiggle the machine so can you show us

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.360 
wiggle the machine so can you show us
that<00:02:16.239> again<00:02:16.510> with<00:02:16.780> not<00:02:17.470> enough<00:02:17.739> tension<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
that again with not enough tension and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.030 
that again with not enough tension and
just<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:19.000> knob<00:02:19.180> spin<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.900> knob<00:02:20.200> spin<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.680> fairly

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
just the knob spin a knob spin is fairly

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.000 
just the knob spin a knob spin is fairly
easily<00:02:21.220> okay

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
easily okay

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.629 
easily okay
we'll<00:02:24.010> get<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> point<00:02:24.730> right<00:02:25.540> about<00:02:25.720> there

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:26.639 
we'll get to a point right about there

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.190 
we'll get to a point right about there
now<00:02:27.639> we<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.910> wiggle<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.269> machine<00:02:28.569> start

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
now we can wiggle the machine start

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.409 
now we can wiggle the machine start
that's<00:02:29.799> enough<00:02:30.130> tension<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:31.060> ahead<00:02:31.269> and

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:31.419 
that's enough tension to go ahead and

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.059 
that's enough tension to go ahead and
start<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.870> machine<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.410> try<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.650> here

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
start the machine and try this here

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.990 
start the machine and try this here
startup<00:02:33.970> engine<00:02:34.450> may<00:02:34.690> or<00:02:34.989> may<00:02:35.230> not<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:36.000> enough

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
startup engine may or may not be enough

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.039 
startup engine may or may not be enough
tension<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.480> actually<00:02:37.900> cut<00:02:38.169> a<00:02:38.200> 5<00:02:39.690> now<00:02:40.690> I'll

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
tension to actually cut a 5 now I'll

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.220 
tension to actually cut a 5 now I'll
show<00:02:41.319> you<00:02:41.380> what's<00:02:42.280> going<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.549> happen

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
show you what's going to happen

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.430 
show you what's going to happen
he's<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> girl<00:02:44.390> when<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.260> little

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
he's a girl when we have just a little

00:02:46.440 --> 00:03:07.800 
he's a girl when we have just a little
bit<00:02:46.620> less<00:02:47.069> tension<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> machine

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.250 

sharpest<00:03:08.680> pretty<00:03:08.890> well<00:03:09.069> anyway<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.110> can

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
sharpest pretty well anyway but you can

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.830 
sharpest pretty well anyway but you can
see<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.680> we've<00:03:11.800> got<00:03:12.010> some<00:03:12.069> some<00:03:12.880> dragging

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
see that we've got some some dragging

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.070 
see that we've got some some dragging
right<00:03:14.050> here<00:03:14.349> you<00:03:15.099> can<00:03:15.280> see<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:15.790> also

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
right here you can see that it's also

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.620 
right here you can see that it's also
making<00:03:17.280> its<00:03:18.280> actually<00:03:18.700> pulling<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.330> fiber

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
making its actually pulling the fiber

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.380 
making its actually pulling the fiber
and<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.500> cutting<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.099> as<00:03:21.250> cleanly<00:03:21.640> as<00:03:21.819> we<00:03:22.180> did

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
and not cutting it as cleanly as we did

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.460 
and not cutting it as cleanly as we did
from<00:03:22.810> here<00:03:23.110> up<00:03:23.230> when<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:23.560> had<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.450> we<00:03:25.840> could

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
from here up when we had so we could

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.180 
from here up when we had so we could
start<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.920> tension<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.470> tried<00:03:29.980> to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
start up tension on it and we tried to

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:45.400 
start up tension on it and we tried to
cut<00:03:30.370> fiber

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.360 

great<00:03:46.340> anything<00:03:47.330> else<00:03:47.390> Matt<00:03:48.220> wonderful<00:03:49.220> good
