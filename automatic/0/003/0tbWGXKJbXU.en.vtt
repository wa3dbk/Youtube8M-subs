00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.910
 another one of those let's say cool 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.250
 will be done now in hollywood is just 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.349
 the book of saves a story already very 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.439
 old that of course is going to be 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.110
 resumed and we already have the protagonist of 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.180
 mobile and this expected name that good 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.250
 finally we already know it's about a thousand 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.109
 series and it will be precisely that 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.949
 interpret mobile and in the version of 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.439
 live action 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.470
 the appointment there we are seeing this 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.870
 small that has been chosen in 300 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.220
 aspiring to interpret the characters 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.519
 iconic animated movies by 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.530
 course of the house disney and good that 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.960
 will have a rather complicated mission 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.199
 danny because he will be the only actor in 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.239
 person who will interact with these 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.049
 animated characters that most 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.570
 the animals will be digitized and good 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.309
 It has all the weight of the film on it 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.510
 however people who do what or 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.320
 said he has no fear 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 because he has all the talent 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.220
 and take it to the screen so the savior 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.920
 the truth is that physically he has a 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 very peculiar resemblance to the drawing 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.070
 animated that we have known for 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.930
 many years and will be wrapped up like 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 well you say by great voices 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 stars as I used the bass player 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.140
 also for example 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.940
 scarlett johansson lupita niang oy 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.619
 good good game and what else do you want to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.750
 enter the world of hollywood to be 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.759
 connected by these great actors that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.860
 although they are not going to see with him is a 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.810
 done that good because their voices will be 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.710
 there of course they will be giving them 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.690
 words besides that is a great 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 responsibility I think it's something 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.000
 wonderful that he will be 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.470
 physically interpreting some parts 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.030
 and you may also be interacting with 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.100
 your animals from the jungle book that 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.759
 they will all be animals today we are seeing 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.860
 a few short advances of the movie 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.950
 of the book of the jungle you remember that the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.890
 voice of light and national was put by 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.130
 german valdÃ©s tin so and good with this 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.179
 this cannes and this song this theme 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.399
 emblematic that is called looking for the most 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.560
 vital has been a classic and good 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.970
 this also has to put pressure on some 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.890
 another way to disney studios but 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.590
 very confident so good the adaptation of 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.270
 maleficent the truth turned day so is it and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.460
 good I in favor that is just the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.770
 new director of this franchise that 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.210
 It has a series of spectacular successes 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.280
 Well, the truth is that I think that 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.720
 can give the touch is very happy for the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.610
 tremendous charisma that has this 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 tiny and of course by having 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 these great voices to be the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.819
 that double the characters that will be 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.709
