00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
can see that there each row is going a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.590 
can see that there each row is going a
different<00:00:19.500> way<00:00:20.240> around<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> tomatoes<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.410> up

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600

I have found this year that this is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.790 
I have found this year that this is
really<00:00:30.689> an<00:00:31.470> easy<00:00:32.250> way<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.649> support<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
really an easy way to support the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.970 
really an easy way to support the
tomatoes<00:00:35.510> without<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:37.280> lot<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.719> time<00:00:39.980> to
