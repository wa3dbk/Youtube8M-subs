a couple of beautiful night courses that
stand<00:02:59.940> above<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.239> rest<00:03:00.360> although<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.440> doesn't

stand above the rest although it doesn't

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.120 
stand above the rest although it doesn't
feel<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.459> headlights<00:03:02.820> on

either<00:03:05.130> way<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.610> courses<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.270> convey<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
either way the courses do convey the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.510 
either way the courses do convey the

and<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.720> overall<00:03:10.110> game<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.500> definitely<00:03:10.739> a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and the overall game is definitely a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.160 
and the overall game is definitely a
technical<00:03:11.670> masterpiece<00:03:11.880> when<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> consider

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
technical masterpiece when you consider

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.010 
technical masterpiece when you consider
how<00:03:13.440> old<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.070> being<00:03:14.820> able<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> save<00:03:15.480> replays

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
how old it is being able to save replays

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.990 
how old it is being able to save replays
and<00:03:16.290> watch<00:03:16.830> them<00:03:17.130> from<00:03:17.250> different<00:03:17.640> angles

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and watch them from different angles

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.880 
and watch them from different angles
probably<00:03:18.540> blew<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> lot<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.140> people's<00:03:19.440> minds

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890

the track for the most part and there

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.619

was intentional or because I suck at
driving<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:02.090> found<00:04:02.569> some<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.959> these<00:04:03.019> tests<00:04:03.409> to

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
driving I found some of these tests to

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.220 
driving I found some of these tests to
be<00:04:03.620> nearly<00:04:03.920> impossible<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.819> pass<00:04:05.079> there<00:04:06.079> were

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
be nearly impossible to pass there were

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.729 
be nearly impossible to pass there were
times<00:04:06.530> when<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.829> almost<00:04:07.099> gave<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.489> on<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.939> game

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
times when I almost gave up on the game

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.349 
times when I almost gave up on the game
luckily<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.799> persevered<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.730> was<00:04:10.969> able<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.239> get

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
luckily I persevered and was able to get

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.899 
luckily I persevered and was able to get
all<00:04:11.569> three<00:04:11.900> licenses<00:04:12.469> but<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.519> idea<00:04:13.819> of

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
all three licenses but the idea of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.089 
all three licenses but the idea of
taking<00:04:14.090> tests<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:14.870> order<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.439> access<00:04:15.680> the

taking tests in order to access the
entire<00:04:16.370> game<00:04:16.729> is<00:04:16.970> not<00:04:17.449> something<00:04:17.959> I'd<00:04:18.079> want<00:04:18.229> to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
entire game is not something I'd want to

it's<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.050> fun<00:04:41.289> way<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.500> race<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.099> I<00:04:42.610> enjoyed<00:04:42.909> the
