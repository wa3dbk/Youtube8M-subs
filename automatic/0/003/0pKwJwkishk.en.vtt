you'll be left with two defenders and
probably<00:05:27.699> one<00:05:27.849> center<00:05:28.210> mid<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:28.509> stays

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
probably one center mid that stays

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.920 
probably one center mid that stays
behind<00:05:28.960> but<00:05:29.860> also<00:05:30.159> it<00:05:30.909> lacks<00:05:31.150> variety<00:05:31.719> in<00:05:31.839> the

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
behind but also it lacks variety in the

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.079 
behind but also it lacks variety in the
midfield<00:05:32.139> they're<00:05:32.500> all<00:05:32.740> center<00:05:33.550> midfielder

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:34.089 
midfield they're all center midfielder

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.089 
midfield they're all center midfielder
so<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.389> have<00:05:34.599> to<00:05:34.779> get<00:05:34.900> some<00:05:35.139> formation<00:05:35.740> cards

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
so you have to get some formation cards

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.040 
so you have to get some formation cards
in<00:05:36.250> which<00:05:36.460> adds<00:05:36.789> an<00:05:37.240> additional<00:05:37.389> cost

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
in which adds an additional cost

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.260 
in which adds an additional cost
especially<00:05:38.409> to<00:05:39.279> convert<00:05:39.610> to<00:05:39.729> a<00:05:39.759> center<00:05:40.089> mid

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
especially to convert to a center mid

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.420 
especially to convert to a center mid
it's<00:05:40.509> really<00:05:40.930> special<00:05:41.259> it<00:05:41.589> really<00:05:42.009> expensive

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
it's really special it really expensive

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.570 
it's really special it really expensive
especially<00:05:42.789> from<00:05:43.509> a<00:05:43.629> camp<00:05:43.900> but<00:05:44.680> I<00:05:44.889> mean<00:05:45.400> that's

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
especially from a camp but I mean that's

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.670 
especially from a camp but I mean that's
pretty<00:05:45.879> much<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.360> we<00:05:46.690> have<00:05:46.839> three<00:05:47.169> center<00:05:47.620> of

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
pretty much it we have three center of

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.070 
pretty much it we have three center of
mids<00:05:48.009> and<00:05:48.279> those<00:05:49.089> are<00:05:49.300> pretty<00:05:49.419> much<00:05:49.599> the<00:05:49.659> cons

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
mids and those are pretty much the cons

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.619 
mids and those are pretty much the cons
but<00:05:50.469> I<00:05:50.710> really<00:05:51.490> do<00:05:51.610> enjoy<00:05:51.639> this<00:05:52.089> formation<00:05:52.419> i
