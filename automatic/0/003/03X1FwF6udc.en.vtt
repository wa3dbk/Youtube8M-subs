00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
couple of months to something that would

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
couple of months to something that would
be<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> next<00:00:51.600> three<00:00:51.840> years<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.649> kind

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
be in the next three years so it's kind

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.200 
be in the next three years so it's kind
of<00:00:52.949> zero<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.520> years<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> short-term

goal<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.780> intermediate<00:00:55.680> goal<00:00:55.920> would<00:00:56.370> probably

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
goal an intermediate goal would probably

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
goal an intermediate goal would probably
go<00:00:56.969> anywhere<00:00:57.329> from<00:00:57.449> three<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> ten<00:00:58.050> years

go anywhere from three to ten years

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
go anywhere from three to ten years
maybe<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.219> purchasing<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> car<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.629> five

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and then a longer-term goal is going to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.730 
and then a longer-term goal is going to
be<00:01:05.850> anything<00:01:06.060> ten<00:01:06.360> years<00:01:06.600> plus<00:01:07.020> maybe<00:01:07.470> buying

able to retire securely those would be

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
able to retire securely those would be
the<00:01:12.330> three<00:01:12.450> types<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.020> goals<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.830> would
