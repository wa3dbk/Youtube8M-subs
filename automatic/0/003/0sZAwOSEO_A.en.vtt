00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.699
 since we live in the center of Prague to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.930
 most attractions can 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 was walking 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.990
 all day we wandered from the map to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
 the city 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.239
 admired the architecture to be honest I 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 I enjoyed shopping more 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.360
 were at every step but more about that in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.360
 separate video 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 i always wanted to go to catholic 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.170
 church and finally my dream came true 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.060
 we went to a whole service listening 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.220
 organ music and everything was so 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.220
 featured in many American films 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.620
 first , of course, like all normal 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.030
 people bought all sorts of excursions that we will 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.610
 walk the course 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.290
 explore the city 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.909
 lucerne 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.680
 and you want to tour it is a delusion 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.909
 the fact that we now went off the map 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.189
 take a walk around the city 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.430
 it's much more interesting what you think 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.090
 bison 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 on this tour of course not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.080
 because we ran around this crowd 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.060
 accounting city stood near some 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.069
 houses for which I can and for free 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.370
 come so stand watch the threat 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.069
 house but normally pretty convinced 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.050
 in the course was this evening brother where to us 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.720
 were told strayed like horror stories 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.370
 horror movies together k and so on the rest 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.730
 it just looked like that we run 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
 and 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.819
 this is such a house and take a picture 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.340
 and that means only we will deliver cameras 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.590
 turn around or have already run away somewhere 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.569
 Generally they were afraid to get a tour 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.519
 get lost then we can only do with 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.390
 all these already there escaped to succeed on 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.430
 one kilometer ahead 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.690
 them these carts will be one on one 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.300
 can go to 2 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.970
 you can go to the bottom of the tour but not 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.760
 more than that itâ€™s just worth 2 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.290
 of money 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.980
 where food 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.230
 it's me 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.190
 not this happiness go to the store and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.930
 buy a whole bunch of junk 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.049
 very interesting to watch the tourists 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.010
 who is dressed like someone we just have not met 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.920
 banks hipster grannies happy yes it was and 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.769
 street musicians at every turn 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.260
 This one uncle I really liked 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.989
 he even allowed me to guard him 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.209
 guitar one evening we stumbled upon 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.750
 pianist who played music from harry 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.569
 potter 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.360
 but in general a lot of that still played and classics 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.400
 and modern music nude music from 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.459
 Harry Potter especially remembered me 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.199
 created such a cozy atmosphere so 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.739
 how everyone was going to listen to some 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:25.600
 musician sat right on the pavement 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.600
 singing it was great
