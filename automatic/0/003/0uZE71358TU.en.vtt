one<00:01:46.920> week<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.200> benefits<00:01:49.770> obviously<00:01:49.950> are

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
one week so the benefits obviously are

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.749 
one week so the benefits obviously are
the<00:01:50.850> SPF<00:01:51.509> 30<00:01:51.899> broad-spectrum<00:01:52.759> broad-spectrum

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the SPF 30 broad-spectrum broad-spectrum

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.670 
the SPF 30 broad-spectrum broad-spectrum
simply<00:01:54.479> means<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.020> protecting<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.080 
simply means that it's protecting you
against<00:01:56.130> both<00:01:56.460> UVA<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
against both UVA and you

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.289 
against both UVA and you
raise<00:01:58.420> both<00:01:59.049> known<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.740> cause<00:02:00.189> in<00:02:00.549> cancer<00:02:00.969> so

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
raise both known to cause in cancer so

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.669 
raise both known to cause in cancer so
you<00:02:01.600> really<00:02:02.140> want<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.350> look<00:02:02.469> for<00:02:02.619> a

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
you really want to look for a

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.410

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
both UVA and UVB rays which means that

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.690 
both UVA and UVB rays which means that
it'll<00:02:07.689> say<00:02:07.899> Rob's<00:02:08.410> burger<00:02:08.769> and<00:02:09.160> this<00:02:09.310> one<00:02:09.489> does

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
it'll say Rob's burger and this one does

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.820 
it'll say Rob's burger and this one does
so<00:02:09.940> that's<00:02:10.300> one<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.599> benefits<00:02:11.110> another

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
so that's one of the benefits another

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.140 
so that's one of the benefits another
benefit<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:13.030> has<00:02:13.269> retinol<00:02:14.050> SMA<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
benefit is that it has retinol SMA and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.630 
benefit is that it has retinol SMA and

and I'm gonna refer to my notes because
I<00:02:33.069> had<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.340> look<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:33.900> our<00:02:34.900> synthetic

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
I had to look this one up our synthetic

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.220 
I had to look this one up our synthetic
sugars<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.130> are<00:02:36.190> naturally<00:02:36.790> occurring

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
sugars that are naturally occurring

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.229 
sugars that are naturally occurring
carbohydrates<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.739> human<00:02:39.099> body<00:02:39.310> used<00:02:40.030> to

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
carbohydrates in the human body used to

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.960

keep skin plump and hydrated so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.380 
keep skin plump and hydrated so
apparently<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.670> our<00:02:45.819> body<00:02:46.060> as

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
apparently we have this in our body as

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.479 
apparently we have this in our body as
babies<00:02:46.930> we<00:02:47.230> have<00:02:47.379> high<00:02:47.620> levels<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.340> as

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
babies we have high levels of it as

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.690 
babies we have high levels of it as
babies<00:02:48.910> but<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:49.870> we<00:02:50.049> age<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.739> levels<00:02:51.220> go<00:02:51.459> down

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
babies but as we age the levels go down

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.809 
babies but as we age the levels go down
so<00:02:52.299> around<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.500> 40s<00:02:53.950> that's<00:02:54.220> when<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.549> really

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
so around the 40s that's when you really

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.160 
so around the 40s that's when you really
start<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> notice<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.780> don't<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.019> that
