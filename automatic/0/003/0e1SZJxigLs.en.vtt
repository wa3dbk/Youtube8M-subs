 already curve tata duties here brings you a 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 new minecraft video in which 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.790
 we will see the things that 4 j studies not me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 4 studies confirmed 100% that they will 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.300
 come the next update of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 minecraft then let's start good 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.029
 they said that these little things are going to come 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.669
 they call hey hey 20 hill veils that are 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.710
 like blocks of straw and that were craft were 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.470
 with wheat putting the wheat well 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.510
 around and you have your block here 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.760
 it's good is I do not know how to know hey 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 good peil is this mother you can 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.359
 place as you want the same is like the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.340
 wood that the one that has as rotation 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.589
 of the block and well then this later 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 they added this thing xxi bad and from the leaf 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.539
 it serves to tie the mods this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 good to all animals you can 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.780
 grab and bring them from brands where 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.010
 you want and if there is a fence you can 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 tie the fence so you do not get 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.050
 escape they added the name tag that if they 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.539
 put in one in a field change the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.909
 name can you put the name that 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.980
 you want for example here pablo 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.960
 we put Pablo and here we have our 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.640
 name tag and once you have our 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.159
 nick name tag we can put it to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 any way of minecraft 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.569
 here as we can see there is Pablo 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.069
 then obviously, they already saw it here 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.619
 come in these days are the 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.710
 already confirmed 100 horses and the donkeys 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.299
 and the mules ok this is this to take it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.280
 you just have to sit on them 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.920
 several times until they're done 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 little hearts and ready and good for a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.099
 Once you know it, do not speak to me to be able to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.049
 sustain the ones you have to put in your 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.649
 Hair food does not right click or 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.240
 trigger this right putting the chair and 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.619
 you can already climb on it and you can 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 control is when you want and you can 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.770
 jump with him to fuck shit 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.509
 the horse to put on the armor is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.979
 exactly the same we climbed 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.229
 the inventory button and we can already 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.610
 put either iron diamond and I 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.310
 I missed the gold I do not know why it tares 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.470
 can also be put to the donkey 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.729
 and he's going to kill your little horses fast 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.729
 so that they are not bothering here in the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.710
 video and making strange sounds because 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.500
 I do not want that to happen 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.630
 [Music] 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 ok what else they added they added the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.000
 coal block and the coal block 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.950
 It is craft 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 just like that with coal putting in each 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.480
 one of the blocks and ready we have 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.880
 gives for 7 a whole stack and we have left over 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.650
 we have 1 spare and this reaches us 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.959
 Obviously, each block reaches us 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.430
 7 times more than normal coal as 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.930
 can see is a block that also for 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.420
 decoration is very beautiful and can be 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.040
 use for several things not then that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.930
 other things come this collection in 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.780
 this update also comes the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.940
 clay that if we put it in an oven and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.260
 we put fuel and right now I'm going 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.930
 to put the coal is to see that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.580
 endures a lot what will happen with this 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.030
 clay once it's finished 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.950
 toast like that is going to be clay 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.870
 and now it puts us fast in 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.739
 creative way so you can get 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.709
 a little more and faster to be and as 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.780
 you can see the clay is now hard and it's 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.280
 it's exactly with the one I have decorated 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.040
 here this part and this part inside 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.830
 as you can see is this very beautiful is 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.270
 because I do not know how I like it because it 's like pro 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.890
 block is good is another block 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.660
 totally different from what you can 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.520
 add colors and how you add colors 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.560
 Well, you have to get them 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.840
 from the color that you want you put it 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.400
 here at the table graph you put it like that and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.170
 in the center you put the color that you 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 you want and there you go and it's going to be dyed 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 of the color that you have put as you can 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.130
 see now is the blue that is also 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.430
 sees very father combined with yellow 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.400
 there is also the red that also the red 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.800
 I really like to know red red is 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.570
 the red be very father also like to 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.000
 the decoration and the whole thing is very 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.230
 but very, very father and finally that 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.940
 would be what would come in this 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.070
 update can you say can you 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.050
 say ah no it is very little but it is 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.240
 that four with jota studies already confirmed 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.470
 perhaps out within a year that 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.270
 come out in two 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.710
 we do not know, I hope it comes out soon 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.360
 because in Seville he took too much 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.610
 waiting for this update I want 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.310
 make a new survival with horses and 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.940
 with many other things that this 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.770
 update and 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.560
 what he is saying is that as 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.380
 can see are very few things what 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.600
 we are expecting several people and what 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.510
 I hope that is not only that 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.010
 understand that is based on this 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.400
 update 44 studies said that is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:29.540
 based on 1.6 point 1 which is the one 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.980
 bring all this nothing else ok but there 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.510
 previous updates that make us 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.370
 missing things like for example the one of 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.070
 halloween we lack the weather that that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.630
 yes I am sure that the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.100
 vampires that I'm also sure and the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.990
 witches I'm sure they are nothing more 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.040
 three little things there that would come but 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.750
 we are also not jumping the 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.280
 redstone update that 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.630
 update there yes I do not dare to 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.550
 say that it's going to come because it can be 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.010
 that four host studies have said no 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.270
 we skipped this and even the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.220
 next update we put this 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.990
 because people want to see horses and not 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.400
 they just wait for one more update can 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.110
 be possible or they might say or that 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.970
 you 're going to put it together with 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.710
 this is what I would see most likely 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.330
 because we've been here a long time 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.180
 waiting but if not then anyway 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.370
 we will always have to wait as always 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.440
 we have to wait with 4j studies and 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.310
 what's in the weston collection for 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.689
 those who want to know in the 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.360
 winston update 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:20.330
 and network comparators this said Persian and 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.339
 all those mothers the drop pers the trap 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.229
 which is that I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.729
 to a stream of things very, very parents 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.269
 that they will serve us to do 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.849
 mechanisms of a very good quality and 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:33.559
 they are going to help us improve all 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.349
 our mechanisms in our worlds and 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:37.539
 to facilitate them not then well this 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.549
 that will come in the update 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.349
 confirmed by 4 j studies that this 

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:46.219
 that we see in the video horses mules 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.709
 armors this the gpl all those mothers 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.059
 and the block of these blocks that I'm 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.309
 throwing the water right now the block 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.629
 all that stuff so I hope that you 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:58.899
 have liked video if it was like this and give it 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.899
 like yes no then sorry for not liking 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:05.519
 goodbye 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.519
