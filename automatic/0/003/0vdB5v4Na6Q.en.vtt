step<00:00:52.079> further<00:00:52.410> first<00:00:53.129> thing<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.550> noticed<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
step further first thing I noticed is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
step further first thing I noticed is
the<00:00:54.270> design<00:00:54.840> although<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.770> thinner

the design although it's much thinner
now<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> much<00:00:57.780> lighter<00:00:58.050> tablet<00:00:58.649> than

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
now this is a much lighter tablet than

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.990 
now this is a much lighter tablet than
previous<00:00:59.129> generations

previous generations

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.510

x86 Windows applications and it can also

x86 Windows applications and it can also

through the use of the touch layer UI it

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.899 
through the use of the touch layer UI it

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
can also function very well as that

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.460 
can also function very well as that

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.680

would level the same argument at the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
Android devices and now this machine it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.990 
Android devices and now this machine it
is<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.540> much<00:03:58.780> closer<00:03:59.139> in<00:03:59.319> price<00:03:59.769> that<00:04:00.729> you're

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
is so much closer in price that you're

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.229 
is so much closer in price that you're
kind<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.329> going<00:04:01.829> stop<00:04:02.829> on<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.250> type<00:04:03.489> cover<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
kind of going stop on the type cover and

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.830 
kind of going stop on the type cover and
you<00:04:04.989> are<00:04:05.199> getting<00:04:05.699> overall<00:04:06.699> better<00:04:07.180> value<00:04:07.810> for

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
you are getting overall better value for

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.050 
you are getting overall better value for
money<00:04:08.109> it's<00:04:08.560> kind<00:04:08.859> of<00:04:08.919> becoming<00:04:09.370> harder<00:04:09.909> and

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
money it's kind of becoming harder and

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.059 
money it's kind of becoming harder and
harder<00:04:10.419> to<00:04:10.569> justify<00:04:11.079> buying<00:04:11.470> an<00:04:11.709> iPad<00:04:12.040> air

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
harder to justify buying an iPad air

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.879 
harder to justify buying an iPad air
particularly<00:04:12.849> when<00:04:13.000> with<00:04:13.180> Windows<00:04:13.479> 10<00:04:13.889> you

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
particularly when with Windows 10 you

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.909 
particularly when with Windows 10 you
are<00:04:14.919> going<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.669> start<00:04:15.909> seeing<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.599> huge<00:04:17.019> on<00:04:17.440> mass

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
are going to start seeing a huge on mass

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.810 
are going to start seeing a huge on mass
porting<00:04:18.729> of<00:04:18.940> Android<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.019> iOS<00:04:20.109> apps<00:04:20.739> into<00:04:21.729> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
porting of Android and iOS apps into the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.560 
porting of Android and iOS apps into the
Windows<00:04:22.120> environment

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
Windows environment

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.420 
Windows environment
I<00:04:23.660> think<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.200> makes<00:04:24.410> this<00:04:24.590> way<00:04:25.070> more

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
I think this makes this way more

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.860 
I think this makes this way more
compelling<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.240> I'm<00:04:26.360> not<00:04:26.450> just<00:04:26.630> saying<00:04:26.810> this

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
compelling and I'm not just saying this

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.530 
compelling and I'm not just saying this
is<00:04:27.080> like<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.290> very<00:04:27.500> Pro<00:04:27.920> Microsoft<00:04:28.640> message

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
is like a very Pro Microsoft message

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.840 
is like a very Pro Microsoft message
I<00:04:29.570> mean<00:04:30.020> clearly<00:04:30.440> is<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.650> few<00:04:30.890> refinements<00:04:31.490> I'd

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
I mean clearly is a few refinements I'd

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.000 
I mean clearly is a few refinements I'd
still<00:04:32.180> like<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.420> see<00:04:32.810> by<00:04:33.320> no<00:04:33.380> means<00:04:33.710> are<00:04:33.890> these

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
still like to see by no means are these

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.760 
still like to see by no means are these
machines<00:04:34.370> going<00:04:34.670> to<00:04:35.000> replace<00:04:35.770> higher-end

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
machines going to replace higher-end

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.680 
machines going to replace higher-end
laptops<00:04:37.220> or<00:04:37.580> powerful<00:04:37.880> desktops<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.510> mean<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
laptops or powerful desktops I mean the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.760 
laptops or powerful desktops I mean the
specs<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.140> aren't<00:04:39.320> there

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
specs just aren't there

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.860 
specs just aren't there
but<00:04:40.040> obviously<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.460> price<00:04:40.730> point<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.390> there

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
but obviously the price point is there

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.260 
but obviously the price point is there
the<00:04:42.260> value<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.680> money<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:43.070> there<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:44.240> are

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
the value for money is there and you are

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.910 
the value for money is there and you are
getting<00:04:44.570> something<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.350> really<00:04:45.770> looks

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
getting something that really looks

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.610 
getting something that really looks
feels<00:04:46.640> great<00:04:47.030> it's<00:04:47.270> incredibly<00:04:47.690> light<00:04:47.780> great

as<00:05:11.240> I've<00:05:11.390> said<00:05:11.600> better<00:05:12.260> days<00:05:12.560> lie<00:05:12.830> ahead<00:05:13.090> even

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
as I've said better days lie ahead even

as I've said better days lie ahead even
for<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.330> machine<00:05:14.590> once<00:05:15.590> Windows<00:05:15.830> 10<00:05:16.220> goes

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
for this machine once Windows 10 goes

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.030 
for this machine once Windows 10 goes
mainstream<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:17.840> get<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.050> free<00:05:18.320> upgrade<00:05:18.740> I

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
mainstream you get that free upgrade I

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.200 
mainstream you get that free upgrade I
think<00:05:19.400> that's<00:05:19.520> really<00:05:19.670> gonna<00:05:19.820> be<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.000> major

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
think that's really gonna be a major

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.050 
think that's really gonna be a major

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.460 
game changer to use a buzzword the type
cover<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.420> still<00:05:23.780> feel<00:05:23.990> it's<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.200> little<00:05:24.380> bit

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.080 
cover I still feel it's a little bit
pricey<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:26.090> know<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.390> is<00:05:26.540> an<00:05:26.930> optional<00:05:27.350> extra

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
pricey you know it is an optional extra
