00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello everybody is a double clutch luca 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:11.880
 this is the presentation of the shoe 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:13.679
 nike to losers 2015 first of all me 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.690
 he also invited to watch the presentation 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.840
 of the previous model of hyper duncan 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.189
 that to keep in mind the variations 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.080
 changes in this new model 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.880
 so I leave you the presentation 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 linked in the description box below 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 the video as always we start with the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.260
 presentation starting with what it is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.050
 amortization in this ipad also 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.329
 compared to 2014 where there was no moon 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.730
 in the targeted in the maintain and in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.680
 back here we have the air zoom 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 then air bag inserted 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.239
 to inter sole also here 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.010
 back part that front to give us 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 impact protection and as always 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 also reactivity for the rest of the inter 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.960
 we only have our classic carrier 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 in file on very light or soft and that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.770
 gives us a good structure anyway 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 general of the sole in full 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.460
 as for the materials we have 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 here also a variation with respect to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.700
 previous model we can say that it is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 changed almost everything to most 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.450
 part of the upper in almost the entire 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.240
 then we ended up in material 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.430
 synthetic while in 2014 we had closed 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080
 and mash then slightly more 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 breathable the previous compared to 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.369
 this with regard to the tongue 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 instead here we have kept one 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.150
 totally mesh tab to give us 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.049
 good comfort and also good 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.299
 breathability 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.439
 regarding the fit the shoe 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 wears true to site 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 so go regularly with with 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 size you wear for others 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.540
 models and other shoes for how much 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.909
 regards the support this is a shoe 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.750
 as always high cut like the whole 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.250
 my card also from 2008 to today and in 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.880
 this model in particular tip 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.670
 so much on the support having both as 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 we said before in material that is brought 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.200
 a little more on the spindle than the match 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.799
 and therefore it has more general structure 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.600
 and both as regards the high cut 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.280
 which gives us much more stability 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.259
 high of the previous version also 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.960
 in the back that however a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.030
 fabric inserts and we can say 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.130
 neoprene to give us anyway with strong 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.410
 in the downturn of the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 anterior anterior of the ankle but 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.440
 however stabilize in the movements 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.370
 lateral 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.640
 we also have a level 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.540
 of the midsole loustal then the sole 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 in rigid rubber that rises in the portions 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.790
 lateral and also medial of the shoe 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.680
 to give us even more facilities here 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.260
 to keep us more stable inside 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.080
 of the base of the shoe in the movements 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.760
 side and we do not have this I say 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.170
 because I noticed we don't have the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.910
 classic sheikh plate then a 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.840
 inserting the saucer into tpu trouble a 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.410
 central level 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.750
 precisely because they want to give us one more 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.400
 shoe yes with the support but let us do it 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 even feel the sun make us so 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.420
 feel the shoe following us on 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.420
 flexion movement of the foot van 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.079
 as final and personal considerations 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.549
 on this hyper dunk 2015 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.709
 well with the previous one has nothing to do with it 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.650
 practically nothing has changed 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.230
 we returned a little to what was in the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.450
 2011 in fact there was also the rc zoom is 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.379
 a little more general support while 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.930
 from 2012 to 2014 followed one another between 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.969
 models with lunan in the midsole and 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.469
 a very very fresh very much upper 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:37.060
 light and giving a more fit 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.310
 soft like type in the sense that it seemed 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.220
 plus a sock compared to a shoe with 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.370
 a real support here looking 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.870
 anyway to give us a feeling like you 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.569
 I also said before about shoes 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.599
 follows in all movements but points 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.500
 so much and I repeat it on support for everything 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.849
 round 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.120
 I also forgot to add 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.459
 that there is our classic flywire that 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.459
 it gives us protection and also support 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.370
 in the lateral and also medial level e 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.769
 compared to previous models 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.079
 this flywire of certainly more often 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.819
 just the cables are bigger in 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.010
 terms of diameter so they are 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.659
 noticed there too as indeed I do 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.669
 many customers have also said that the 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.650
 flight white broke after maybe 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.659
 also a season however one yes 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.550
 wait for it to stay until the end e 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.830
 so they tried to force it too 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.389
 this weak point as I always do 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.970
 thank you for following this too 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.130
 presentation of invitation to share and to 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.199
 cli car and light both here on youtube and
