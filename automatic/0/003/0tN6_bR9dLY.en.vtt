is<00:01:34.500> gonna<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.890> okay<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.310> Houston<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
is gonna be okay see Houston or the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.819 
is gonna be okay see Houston or the
winner<00:01:37.470> got<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> spurt<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.320> Warriors

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
winner got a spurt out of the Warriors

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.700 
winner got a spurt out of the Warriors
and<00:01:41.159> clippers<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> hot<00:01:42.420> teams

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
and clippers I know that's a hot teams

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
and clippers I know that's a hot teams
but<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.920> feel<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> west<00:01:44.640> team<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
but I feel like a west team is going to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
but I feel like a west team is going to
take<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.420> year<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.710> don't<00:01:46.890> think

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
take it this year I really don't think

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.350 
take it this year I really don't think
the<00:01:47.340> Heat<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> go<00:01:47.909> forward<00:01:48.180> because

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the Heat are going to go forward because

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
they'll go as far as weight goes and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.639 
they'll go as far as weight goes and

weights injury is more serious than

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
weights injury is more serious than
they're<00:01:53.040> actually<00:01:53.340> putting<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
they're actually putting out then you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.730

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
just not be able to go the distance so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.580 
just not be able to go the distance so
and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> East<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.729> toss-up<00:02:03.299> if

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
and then the East is a toss-up if

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.420 
and then the East is a toss-up if
