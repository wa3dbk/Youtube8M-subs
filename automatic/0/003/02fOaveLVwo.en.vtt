00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
them both I was really excited for this

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.600 
them both I was really excited for this
one<00:03:04.480> because<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.260> sounds<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:06.310> very

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
one because it sounds just very

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.250 
one because it sounds just very
interesting<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.420> unlike<00:03:07.720> anything<00:03:07.989> I've

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
interesting and unlike anything I've

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.130 
interesting and unlike anything I've
read<00:03:08.470> before<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:09.220> deals<00:03:09.580> with<00:03:09.730> PTSD<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.930> this

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
read before it deals with PTSD so this

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.800 
read before it deals with PTSD so this
girl's<00:03:11.380> father<00:03:11.620> has<00:03:12.010> returned<00:03:12.519> from<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.420> think

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
girl's father has returned from I think

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.979

it's<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.200> war<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.650> Iraq<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.569> it's<00:03:16.569> just<00:03:16.780> kind

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
it's the war in Iraq and it's just kind

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.449 
it's the war in Iraq and it's just kind
of<00:03:17.049> their<00:03:17.560> struggles<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.310> he<00:03:18.970> tries<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:20.459> kind

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
of their struggles as he tries to kind

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.009

the war which it's actually inspired by

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.199 
the war which it's actually inspired by
someone<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.709> Laurie<00:03:30.070> Halse<00:03:30.220> Anderson<00:03:30.370> family
