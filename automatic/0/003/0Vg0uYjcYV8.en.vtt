 something

 let's see how it is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.030
 there is such a deck of cards 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.660
 cards 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:09.250
 quite colorful and beautiful and true 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.250
 quality expect them 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.630
 then each brand is dealt 8 cards 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.500
 then the game begins 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.789
 what we see here on the main field on 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.259
 elephant field we see expeditions te 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.520
 expeditions we must 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.860
 set off for just incredible 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 adventures 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.710
 everything is just so great that I don't even 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.020
 I know what else to say about it 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:01.049
 so everyone looks at their cards and see 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:06.479
 what can I do here you can put 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.259
 cards only one on another ok 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.580
 ascending 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 here I suppose pass put a card 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.910
 9 court lay out then I can not then 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.110
 put 8 because it is forbidden 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.610
 rules i can only put 10 and so 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.299
 Further, that is, here I put 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.920
 suppose 4 lay out then laid out 8 i 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.519
 I can not then if I fall out 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.470
 six put six in general then 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:40.319
 everything is simple and ingenious now exists 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.540
 some types of cards like guys paired 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.400
 double our points accordingly if 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.170
 this guy will be two then they will be income 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.540
 equal to 3 pairs respectively will be 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:57.170
 multiply our points by 4 our goal is to collect 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.660
 as much as possible not only expedition 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.860
 our goal is to collect as much as possible 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.230
 expeditions which will be the greatest 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:14.180
 the number of cards used because 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:19.150
 what is 8 or more cards in one 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.150
 expedition we get 20 bonus points 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.319
 if you are not sure your expedition 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.090
 will be successful then it does not make sense 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.459
 bet because otherwise 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.470
 case we also go over costs 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.950
 expedition it is natural we have to 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.989
 her spend something and we get a minus 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.000
 20 points but this card accordingly 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.310
 lies just with us so we are an expedition 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.630
 started betting we get minus 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.870
 40 points it naturally pushes you away 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.489
 back meaning this have no further 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.170
 the players 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:59.440
 Each player plays in turn, that is, 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:02.420
 laid out the card took the card in hand 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.040
 respectively, further assume 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.530
 further on the other player their cards are not 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.540
 intersects that is here have a look 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.370
 Here I have a green card or green 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:21.019
 darling steam better started coming next 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.600
 player layer player from the sea ​​of ​​this well something 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.030
 somehow I don't want to strain too much 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.340
 I want to wait a bit with was lukas 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.430
 Spread these cards I need how to 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.650
 smaller denomination yes I'm posting here 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.320
 in this way this card will be common 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.410
 that is, the dough another player suddenly wants 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.080
 will say then I want this card here he can 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.870
 instead of putting the card from your hand 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.870
 he puts the Carpathians in this way 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.489
 in general, all that can be said about 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.429
 this game 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:05:04.039
 decoration is beautiful as far as it is 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:06.459
 it's interesting for each player to solve 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.769
 its well, of course the price is the price in this game 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:15.219
 she is not big maybe so 

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:15.219
 or buy
