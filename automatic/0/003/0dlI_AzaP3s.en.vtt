which<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> great<00:00:20.520> game<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.330> know<00:00:21.500> it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500

which is it's a great game you know it
they've<00:00:23.070> realism<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.730> lack<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.910> realism

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
they've realism the lack of realism

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.480 
they've realism the lack of realism
differently<00:00:24.810> bother<00:00:25.230> me<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
differently bother me because the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.000 
differently bother me because the
armored<00:00:26.880> warfare<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.410> big<00:00:28.500> part

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
armored warfare is not a very big part

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.279 
armored warfare is not a very big part
of<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.210> mostly<00:00:30.570> they're<00:00:30.779> mostly

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
of this game it's mostly they're mostly

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
of this game it's mostly they're mostly
the<00:00:31.470> aerial<00:00:31.769> warfare<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.369> there's<00:00:32.550> nothing

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the aerial warfare and there's nothing

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
the aerial warfare and there's nothing
wrong<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.960> realism<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
wrong with the realism there and this is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.389 
wrong with the realism there and this is
a<00:00:35.460> Huey<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> American<00:00:36.390> helicopter<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
a Huey to the American helicopter and

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
a Huey to the American helicopter and
I'm<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.059> try<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.510> kill<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'm not going to really try and kill it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.790 
I'm not going to really try and kill it
because<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.980> mi-8<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.790> anti<00:00:42.780> ground<00:00:43.260> not

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
because this mi-8 is anti ground not

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
because this mi-8 is anti ground not
anti<00:00:44.399> air<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.000> anti<00:00:45.300> air<00:00:45.570> helicopter<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.230> this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
anti air the anti air helicopter in this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.889 
anti air the anti air helicopter in this
game<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:46.829> available<00:00:47.190> online<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
game is only available online it is

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.790 
game is only available online it is
called<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.500> KA<00:00:50.039> 25<00:00:51.020> hormone<00:00:52.020> i<00:00:52.050> believe<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
called the KA 25 hormone i believe and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
called the KA 25 hormone i believe and
it's<00:00:53.280> great<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> missiles<00:00:55.050> are

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it's great because the the missiles are

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.650 
it's great because the the missiles are
heat-seeking<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.239> crush<00:00:57.239> enemy

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
heat-seeking so you can just crush enemy

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.090 
heat-seeking so you can just crush enemy
helicopters<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:58.469> ease<00:00:59.059> i<00:01:00.890> don't<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:01.920> i'm

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
helicopters with ease i don't think i'm

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
helicopters with ease i don't think i'm
able<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> shoot<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.120> whatever<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
able to shoot this but whatever was just

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.219 
able to shoot this but whatever was just
yeah<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.519> misses<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.900> hard<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
yeah see just misses it's really hard to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.280 
yeah see just misses it's really hard to
shoot<00:01:07.380> other<00:01:07.500> helicopters<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.460> thing<00:01:09.290> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
shoot other helicopters in this thing so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320

driver<00:02:28.850> for<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.360> vehicle<00:02:29.660> then<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:29.989> play

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110

only way you can play music you know

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.229 
only way you can play music you know
like<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:33.500> basically<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.980> radio<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.090> makes

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
like it's basically a radio so it makes

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.720 
like it's basically a radio so it makes
sense<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.750> i'm<00:02:36.470> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> attempt<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.580> do

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
sense and i'm going to attempt to do

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
sense and i'm going to attempt to do
something<00:02:38.030> very<00:02:38.180> difficult<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.470> is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
something very difficult and that is

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.589 
battlefield vietnam and there are tanks
in<00:07:32.460> this<00:07:32.520> game<00:07:32.699> but<00:07:32.849> it's<00:07:33.000> highly<00:07:33.180> and

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 
in this game but it's highly and

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.210 
in this game but it's highly and
realistic<00:07:34.139> just<00:07:34.410> like<00:07:34.560> ridiculously

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 
realistic just like ridiculously

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.249 
realistic just like ridiculously
unrealistic<00:07:35.669> that's<00:07:36.060> why<00:07:36.240> i<00:07:36.270> don't<00:07:36.479> really

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 
unrealistic that's why i don't really

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:38.870 
unrealistic that's why i don't really
like<00:07:37.349> to<00:07:37.710> do<00:07:38.009> anything<00:07:38.099> other<00:07:38.370> than<00:07:38.550> just<00:07:38.669> kind

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
like to do anything other than just kind

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.730 
like to do anything other than just kind
of<00:07:38.910> cruise<00:07:39.180> around<00:07:39.300> in<00:07:39.479> helicopters<00:07:39.620> but<00:07:40.620> the

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 
of cruise around in helicopters but the

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.529 
of cruise around in helicopters but the
pure<00:07:40.949> infantry<00:07:41.639> combat<00:07:41.759> is<00:07:42.060> great<00:07:42.389> too

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 
pure infantry combat is great too

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:44.210 
pure infantry combat is great too
because<00:07:42.690> there<00:07:42.930> are<00:07:42.990> AK<00:07:43.320> forty-sevens<00:07:44.009> and

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
because there are AK forty-sevens and

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.270 
because there are AK forty-sevens and
they're<00:07:44.310> just<00:07:44.460> fun<00:07:44.880> to<00:07:45.090> use<00:07:45.360> and<00:07:45.690> look<00:07:46.560> because

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 
they're just fun to use and look because

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.800 
they're just fun to use and look because
i've<00:07:47.490> been<00:07:47.520> dominated<00:07:48.090> in<00:07:48.180> the<00:07:48.240> errors<00:07:48.570> my

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810 
i've been dominated in the errors my

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.939 
i've been dominated in the errors my
allies<00:07:49.169> in<00:07:49.289> the<00:07:49.349> ground<00:07:49.560> have<00:07:49.800> been

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:49.949 
allies in the ground have been

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:52.490 
allies in the ground have been
dominating<00:07:50.490> there<00:07:50.669> so<00:07:51.030> we've<00:07:51.320> were<00:07:52.320> pretty

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 
dominating there so we've were pretty

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.899 
dominating there so we've were pretty
much<00:07:52.590> in<00:07:52.770> firm<00:07:53.039> control<00:07:53.099> of<00:07:53.400> this<00:07:53.460> battle<00:07:53.789> and
