00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.589
 the almost floating bicycle tire of the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.400
 Bicycle tire is only one-sided 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.679
 but he does not give up 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.070
 what is the cause of this effect 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.029
 two moments play a big role 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.640
 moment 1 is created by the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 Earth attraction is the mature one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 here only hung on one side of the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.050
 focus the distance he to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 suspension and tilts through the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 gravitation around it arises 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050
 torque 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.640
 moment 2 is a bit more complicated 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 if we toast the ripe we bring 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.900
 through a force of energy the system of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.910
 Tire rotates with its entire mass 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.040
 in turn, a distance to the axis of rotation 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.070
 so there is another one 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.100
 torque the faster the tire 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.300
 rotates the bigger the moment 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.710
 Now let go of the one side 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.930
 so the mature only on the thread 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.760
 hangs both torque suddenly 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.070
 together and as usual in physics 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.930
 has created a resultant one so 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 resulting moment what the whole 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.920
 system adds another share 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.580
 to rotate and there is one 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.159
 fold concept 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 it is the so-called precision with it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.510
 we change the direction of one 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.980
 rotation axis refers to the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.300
 angle speed gets bigger and 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.159
 everything moves faster around the new axle 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.840
 either the distance has to turn 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.460
 focus or mass increased 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.500
 or the moment of inertia 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.510
 downsized or the wheel slow 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.250
 be turned on 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.200
 and because it is easiest to hang 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.760
 We just once a kilogram 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 extra weight and see that 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.200
 it actually rotates faster 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.149
 by friction is decreasing more and more 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.369
 the angular speed of the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.729
 so it gradually matures 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.289
 further tilts and remembers forget about it 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.490
