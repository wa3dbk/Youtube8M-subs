them there so as you can see the glue is
still<00:01:44.979> white<00:01:45.310> which<00:01:45.790> means<00:01:46.120> that<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:46.630> still

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
still white which means that it's still

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.680 
still white which means that it's still
a<00:01:46.960> little<00:01:47.290> bit<00:01:47.560> wet<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.070> will<00:01:48.310> dry<00:01:48.610> clear<00:01:48.690> but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
a little bit wet it will dry clear but

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.630 
a little bit wet it will dry clear but
right<00:01:49.900> now<00:01:50.049> we're<00:01:50.290> taking<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.979> tweezers<00:01:51.400> and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
right now we're taking the tweezers and

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.230

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
secured so we're putting that lash line

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.100
