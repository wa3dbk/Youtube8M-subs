00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello everyone when I shot a video of my own 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 wooden clamps ah i talked about 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.830
 that the hole in the movable sponge 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.960
 i'm made oval to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 the sponge could be shifted so 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.590
 I did ovality with a drill 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.580
 cutters 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.830
 I will tell you about it now 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.029
 drill sharpening metal 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 which has such a jagged 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.050
 the notch in which it is made in a spiral along 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.420
 manufacturers' assurances 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.059
 this drill is designed as for 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 metal and wood for chipboard 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.640
 Now I will demonstrate more 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 fine 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.260
 6 millimeter how she copes with 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.260
 a tree is a pine bar 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:24.909
 [music] 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.390
 in just a few seconds 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.270
 this hole turned out of course 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.350
 this tool is not for accurate work and it 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.119
 can not be compared with the cutter or say 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.030
 with a jigsaw saw but when you need it like this 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.979
 here is a rough material 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.820
 then this tool copes well 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:07.079
 now chipboard 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:07.079
 [music] 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.009
 [music] 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.700
 well and then will be metal 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.490
 [music] 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.449
 [music] 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.599
 [music] 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.680
 in some cases this drill is quite 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.940
 can replace the file but there is one 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.310
 This drill gives pretty 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.100
 heavy load on drill bearings 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 so the drill should be powerful and 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.470
 preferably some kind of brand because 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.490
 let's say a Chinese with such loads 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.600
 even a 6 mm drill bit 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:36.100
 will not live well, that's probably all on 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:39.570
 today is a video subscribe to 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:44.160
 my channel to keep abreast of news 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.160
 Thank you all for your attention
