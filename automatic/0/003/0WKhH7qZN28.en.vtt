00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
definitely need them in the championship
as<00:00:44.610> well<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> championship<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.570> very

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
as well because the championship is very

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.119 
as well because the championship is very
difficult<00:00:45.899> League<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
difficult League and to get out the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.500 
difficult League and to get out the
championship<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.700> believe<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> be

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
championship I believe it's going to be

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.830 
championship I believe it's going to be
extremely<00:00:49.469> difficult<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.539> continue

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
extremely difficult but if we continue

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
extremely difficult but if we continue
our<00:00:51.870> form<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.230> late<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.789> continue<00:00:53.789> playing

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
our form of late and continue playing

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
our form of late and continue playing
the<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.289> been<00:00:55.440> playing<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.980> believe

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the way we have been playing I believe

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
the way we have been playing I believe
we<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.910> well<00:00:57.120> especially<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> players

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
we can do well especially if the players

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.750 
we can do well especially if the players
continue<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> grow<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.100> yard<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> asked

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
after that goal that we managed to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.410 
after that goal that we managed to
concede<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.200> against<00:02:08.069> um<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.310> attack<00:02:09.149> no<00:02:09.300> and

actually quite a long way out I wasn't

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.790 
actually quite a long way out I wasn't
just<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.050> edge<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> box<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> was<00:02:49.560> still

go ahead and play them and that then

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.120 
go ahead and play them and that then
determines<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.050> true<00:04:04.350> winner<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
drawers and paint trophy so hopefully we

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.820 
drawers and paint trophy so hopefully we
can<00:04:06.870> go<00:04:06.930> ahead<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.170> win<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.680> hopefully

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
can go ahead and win that and hopefully

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.030

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
get a few funds into the bank and then

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.500 
get a few funds into the bank and then
funds<00:04:11.340> could<00:04:11.489> help<00:04:11.700> us<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> upper<00:04:12.269> coming

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
money if you were doing so well with the

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.550 
money if you were doing so well with the
club<00:05:21.880> but<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.389> first<00:05:22.539> goal<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:22.990> game<00:05:23.139> does

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
club but the first goal of the game does

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.040 
club but the first goal of the game does
actually<00:05:23.680> come<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.130> worse<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.490> legend<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.300> guy

goalkeeper<00:05:36.669> was<00:05:36.819> I<00:05:37.210> don't<00:05:37.509> know<00:05:37.810> what<00:05:38.139> he<00:05:38.229> was

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
goalkeeper was I don't know what he was

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.499 
goalkeeper was I don't know what he was
doing<00:05:38.409> but<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:39.069> think<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.639> bounce<00:05:39.909> and<00:05:40.240> the

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
doing but I think the bounce and the

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.899 
doing but I think the bounce and the
curve<00:05:40.870> deceived<00:05:41.440> him<00:05:41.710> as<00:05:41.860> he<00:05:42.520> pretty<00:05:42.819> much

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
curve deceived him as he pretty much

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.360 
curve deceived him as he pretty much
tried<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.479> dive<00:05:43.659> and<00:05:43.900> then<00:05:43.990> for<00:05:44.500> out<00:05:44.740> last

is<00:06:08.199> that<00:06:08.319> far<00:06:08.529> out<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.710> pitch<00:06:08.919> it<00:06:09.490> was

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
is that far out the pitch it was

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.580 
is that far out the pitch it was
obviously<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.180> definite<00:06:10.779> definite<00:06:11.169> penalty

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
obviously a definite definite penalty

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.680 
obviously a definite definite penalty
and<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:12.130> definite<00:06:12.550> red<00:06:12.699> card<00:06:12.969> as<00:06:13.180> he<00:06:13.360> managed<00:06:13.630> to

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
and a definite red card as he managed to

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.809 
and a definite red card as he managed to
get<00:06:13.840> sent<00:06:14.080> off<00:06:14.259> and<00:06:14.500> because<00:06:15.400> legend<00:06:15.729> had

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
get sent off and because legend had

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.100 
get sent off and because legend had
already<00:06:15.909> scored<00:06:16.180> a<00:06:16.300> goal<00:06:16.419> in<00:06:16.479> this<00:06:16.630> game<00:06:16.870> and

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
already scored a goal in this game and

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.559 
already scored a goal in this game and
he<00:06:17.620> hardly<00:06:17.830> ever<00:06:17.949> scores<00:06:18.699> I<00:06:18.909> decided<00:06:19.240> to<00:06:19.389> give

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
he hardly ever scores I decided to give

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.899 
he hardly ever scores I decided to give
the<00:06:19.599> penalties<00:06:20.110> Ledson<00:06:20.529> he's<00:06:20.889> got<00:06:21.039> 61<00:06:21.400> penalty

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
the penalties Ledson he's got 61 penalty

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.580 
the penalties Ledson he's got 61 penalty
so<00:06:22.060> he's<00:06:22.180> not<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.419> best<00:06:22.539> but<00:06:22.719> I<00:06:23.080> decided<00:06:23.469> to

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
so he's not the best but I decided to

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.959 
so he's not the best but I decided to
give<00:06:23.710> it<00:06:23.740> to<00:06:23.889> our<00:06:23.979> number<00:06:24.250> 8<00:06:24.430> our<00:06:24.669> sense

what surprised me as much actually did

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.630 
what surprised me as much actually did
because<00:07:04.780> he<00:07:05.170> actually<00:07:05.380> never<00:07:05.890> scores<00:07:06.250> if<00:07:06.460> you

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640
