00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 I go 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.090
 here they did with regard to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.090
 US 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 it's beautiful failure there is on a game 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.259
 because it requires double fault 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.259
 an easy ball 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.250
 these two times 1 that he is at 40 30 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.610
 what can it do gerard 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.610
 mentally to have this weapon 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.870
 he approaches the points the door his games 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.870
 on duty 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.620
 without panic he is overwhelmed pete 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.540
 sampras they do not try to shoot 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:48.090
 a passing shot shot he would not have the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:48.569
 time the Americans who benefits from it for 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.290
 moving forward 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.290
 30 to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.410
 she is good 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.640
 when the parties very high this ball 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:26.860
 on this one he has made good progress that he has 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.860
 slammed this end of 106 km hour 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.940
 unplayable for them to come to life 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.540
 and 6-3 for quick sampras that offers itself 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.540
 three set balls 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.290
 what control of pete sampras in this 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.680
 unique game yet it hurt 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.380
 started 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.720
 by losing the first point on his 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.880
 service but he has recovered well 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.400
 he wins the first set the American 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:22.830
 seven games to six hundred and forty-one 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:34.650
 minutes sitting plus luck is 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:36.360
 mix back-volley sudan on this point there 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.010
 down they could not yes but that's 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.030
 true that all in all despite the 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.450
 Basically it is far from being 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.370
 ridiculous 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.700
 he scored almost every point of the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.700
 bottom of court 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.130
 and that no 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:12.830
 the mood is figured ah yes the sardine 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:23.810
 the cannonball is in service and 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.810
 starts with ace 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:55.389
 the wrong choice of players are having fun 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:57.460
 Hall was doubled without a problem 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.050
 for pete sampras who made a 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.639
 scare in the first run 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.699
 since he had to argue anyway 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.130
 decisive game but after he rolled out 7 6 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.320
 6 2 in one hour and ten minutes pete 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.850
 sampras qualifies for the following this 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.550
 turn we have to say for the third 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.169
 turn where he will play maybe a match 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.990
 easy for him a the winner of 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.030
 sarkissian or the playable rose that's right 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.919
 that with the level of pete sampras he 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.599
 sufficient that he plays well or who are 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.930
 normally you are really few players 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.930
 can worry him 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.530
 karima the life that tried everything he 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.320
 could unfortunately even serving 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.310
 wonderfully he could not compete 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.310
 facing pete sampras 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.500
