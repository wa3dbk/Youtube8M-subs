significantly<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.100> plan<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.340> DPS

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
significantly more now so plan your DPS

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.200 
significantly more now so plan your DPS

around that - in the end we chose to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.589 
around that - in the end we chose to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
send 9 DPS de Rojas and 7 to antral but

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.370 
send 9 DPS de Rojas and 7 to antral but

shamans who was over at the antral
platform<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.520> as<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.570> can<00:02:52.660> see<00:02:52.810> our<00:02:52.900> DK<00:02:53.230> is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
platform and as you can see our DK is

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.990 
platform and as you can see our DK is
basically<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.100> running<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.490> circles<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
basically just running in circles the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.270 
basically just running in circles the
entire<00:02:55.300> fight<00:02:55.630> which<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.440> feel<00:02:56.860> kind<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.130> bad

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
entire fight which I feel kind of bad

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.450 
entire fight which I feel kind of bad
for<00:02:57.340> him<00:02:57.670> but<00:02:57.880> uh<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:59.170> his<00:02:59.320> job<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.830> he's

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
for him but uh that's his job and he's

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.690 
for him but uh that's his job and he's
happy<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.970> do<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:02.050> he<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.190> cuts<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.520> adds

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
happy to do it so he just cuts the adds

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.670 
happy to do it so he just cuts the adds
the<00:03:03.880> entire<00:03:04.150> fight<00:03:04.390> takes<00:03:04.810> them<00:03:04.990> entirely<00:03:05.470> out

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
the entire fight takes them entirely out

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.410 
the entire fight takes them entirely out
of<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.830> equation<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.940> think<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.270> works

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
of the equation and I think that works

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.110 
of the equation and I think that works
out<00:03:07.600> for<00:03:07.710> for<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.830> best<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.730> see<00:03:09.910> here

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
out for for the best you can see here

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.760 
out for for the best you can see here
just<00:03:10.150> how<00:03:10.480> much<00:03:10.660> damage<00:03:10.960> storm<00:03:11.260> shield<00:03:11.500> does

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
just how much damage storm shield does

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.830 
just how much damage storm shield does
and<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.100> not<00:03:12.250> taking<00:03:12.610> off<00:03:12.760> quickly<00:03:13.330> right

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
and it's not taking off quickly right

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.590 
and it's not taking off quickly right
there<00:03:14.020> got<00:03:14.200> about<00:03:14.440> three<00:03:14.860> full<00:03:15.160> ticks<00:03:15.430> off<00:03:15.640> we

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
there got about three full ticks off we

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.920 
there got about three full ticks off we
usually<00:03:17.020> only<00:03:17.110> get<00:03:17.350> two<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.790> time<00:03:19.030> could

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
usually only get two but that time could

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.630 
usually only get two but that time could
have<00:03:19.960> been<00:03:20.050> just<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.620> DPS<00:03:21.190> cooldowns

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
have been just that DPS cooldowns

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.940 
have been just that DPS cooldowns

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
you get through the RNG of roja SH and

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.820 
you get through the RNG of roja SH and
wind<00:05:44.939> blast<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.569> perfect<00:05:46.169> your<00:05:46.289> positioning

over there this fight will become

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.679 
over there this fight will become
significantly<00:05:49.560> easier<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.569> probably<00:05:51.569> one<00:05:51.659> of

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
significantly easier and probably one of
