00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.320
 the opportunity arose to come 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.299
 to ride here and we will try to make 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 best possible for me to spend two 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 driving wheels at a ds3 r 5 of 300 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 horses it's the dream so the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.660
 car frankly the readers agile 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.370
 with a good engine a bomb at the level 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.630
 speed for me everything is perfect 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.150
 for now I have not had the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.150
 chance to compare that to the big wrc 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.440
 2 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.220
 we will see and I wear it pretty well 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.050
 because I'm already in the lead 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.890
 ab championship it's clear that the earth 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.059
 it's 80% of the world championship 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.360
 so if we want to make a career in 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.130
 wrc 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.130
 we have to go fast on the earth 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.780
 the 250 kg his luck and as level 330 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.049
 million hired exit scoop take 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 end 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.210
 as soon as temptation stand in 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.010
 your brenda bridge child 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.060
 finally flag-bearer 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.060
 aubry is past 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 he 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.500
 we did a good rally after since 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.720
 early we were in the game we will say 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.740
 after how did we make an exit from 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.740
 road to touquet so still needed 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.020
 found him regain the rhythm and then 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.490
 regain confidence that here on a 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.130
 rally that is still very fast 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.300
 here are not necessarily obvious but 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.170
 here we managed to get by 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.590
 yes I think the championship there is 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.380
 inevitably vincent and yoann they are 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.060
 we are 3 3 in the lead finally johann hivin a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.489
 little advanced championship but it's not 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.380
 much and after he gave it 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.209
 try to be fast all year but I 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 think everyone is comfortable on 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.150
 asphalt the world is comfortable on the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.950
 earth so it's going to be a 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.579
 it's going to be a nice championship I think 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.579
