00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.990
 way down 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.860

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.970
 We start the analysis of the song lyrics and chords 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.580
 the songs you will find on the site on the left 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.020
 places to play each chord a in the right 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.330
 parts is digitization which 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.010
 shows how many times each is played 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.410
 chord 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.640
 parse verse of the song was going to play 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.260
 sixes every chord 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.260

 the way down is done 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.810
 the hand returns without impact and that is 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.250
 It turns out this kind of pain means 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.250
