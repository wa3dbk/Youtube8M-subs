00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the situation like me where you're

the situation like me where you're
having<00:00:44.700> some<00:00:45.000> damage<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
having some damage what can you do to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
having some damage what can you do to
prevent<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:48.000> could<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
prevent well we could do like the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.400 
prevent well we could do like the
commercial<00:00:49.500> growers<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.250> spray<00:00:50.789> water<00:00:51.410> over

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
commercial growers and spray water over

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
commercial growers and spray water over
plants<00:00:53.070> particularly<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.930> of

a<00:00:58.020> hose<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.649> spray<00:00:59.520> water<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.170> see

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
a hose and spray water over it you see

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
a hose and spray water over it you see
when<00:01:01.770> water<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> spread<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:04.080> releases

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
when water is spread and it releases

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
when water is spread and it releases
Litton<00:01:05.280> heat<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.180> often<00:01:06.900> enough<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
Litton heat and that's often enough to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.460 
Litton heat and that's often enough to
prevent<00:01:08.010> damage<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
prevent damage now if you just have a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.640 
prevent damage now if you just have a
few<00:01:10.890> isolated<00:01:11.220> small<00:01:12.210> plants<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:13.020> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
few isolated small plants like this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
few isolated small plants like this
hydrangea<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.060> soft<00:01:15.420> young<00:01:15.750> growth<00:01:16.049> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
hydrangea here with soft young growth on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
hydrangea here with soft young growth on
it<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.189> employ<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.729> old<00:01:17.880> method<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it you can employ the old method of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
it you can employ the old method of
putting<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:19.080> form<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.590> protection<00:01:20.040> over<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
putting some form of protection over the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
putting some form of protection over the
top<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:22.020> gather<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.530> branches<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
top of it just gather the branches and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
top of it just gather the branches and
cover<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.570> night<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.890> will

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
cover it up for the night and that will

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.730 
cover it up for the night and that will
do<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> trick<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.390> too<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.590> at

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
do the trick it's not too pretty but at

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.100 
do the trick it's not too pretty but at
least<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.490> prevent<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> damage<00:01:30.390> during

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
least it will prevent the damage during

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710 
least it will prevent the damage during
the<00:01:31.259> night<00:01:31.850> but<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.360> taller

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the night but when you have taller

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
the night but when you have taller
plants<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.890> Japanese<00:01:35.549> maple<00:01:36.180> here

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
plants like this Japanese maple here

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.440 
plants like this Japanese maple here
that's<00:01:36.990> got<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.009> soft<00:01:38.670> young<00:01:39.119> growth

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that's got a lot of soft young growth

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
that's got a lot of soft young growth
you're<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> employ<00:01:41.310> other

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you're going to have to employ other

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.770 
you're going to have to employ other
methods<00:01:43.189> now<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.579> mean<00:01:44.850> putting<00:01:45.450> some

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
methods now that would mean putting some

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
methods now that would mean putting some
sort<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> insulation<00:01:47.070> material<00:01:47.610> over<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.180> top

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
sort of insulation material over the top

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690 
sort of insulation material over the top
of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> plants<00:01:49.049> draping<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> over<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.670> old

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of the plants draping it over in the old

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.270 
of the plants draping it over in the old
days<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.509> used<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:51.930> sheets<00:01:52.500> perhaps<00:01:53.040> even

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
days we used to use sheets perhaps even

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
days we used to use sheets perhaps even
blankets<00:01:53.970> though<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.540> tend<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> bit

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
blankets though they tend to be a bit

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.700 
blankets though they tend to be a bit
heavy<00:01:55.759> yeah<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.030> sometimes<00:01:57.360> use<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.259> fabric

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
heavy yeah I sometimes use the fabric

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.709 
heavy yeah I sometimes use the fabric
that<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.920> use<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> garden<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.210> collecting

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
that I use in the garden for collecting

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.740 
that I use in the garden for collecting
off<00:02:00.869> trimmings<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.729> weeds<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.570> on

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
off trimmings and your weeds and so on

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.800 
off trimmings and your weeds and so on
and<00:02:04.070> plastic<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.250> better<00:02:05.790> than<00:02:06.119> nothing<00:02:06.630> but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and plastic is better than nothing but

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
and plastic is better than nothing but
honestly<00:02:07.770> plastic<00:02:08.399> isn't<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.970> great

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
honestly plastic isn't that great

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.570 
honestly plastic isn't that great
because<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.929> tends<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.410> collect<00:02:10.709> humidity<00:02:11.370> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
because it tends to collect humidity in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.850 
because it tends to collect humidity in
underneath<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.900> temperature<00:02:13.410> under

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
underneath and the temperature under

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
underneath and the temperature under
plastic<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.460> sometimes<00:02:14.940> actually<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.540> colder

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
plastic can sometimes actually be colder

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
than it is out in the open air but for

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.430 
than it is out in the open air but for
me<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.650> best<00:02:19.950> material<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.570> fleecy

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
me the best material is this fleecy

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.150 
me the best material is this fleecy
frost<00:02:23.310> blanket<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.450> great<00:02:25.020> stuff<00:02:25.410> it's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
frost blanket this is great stuff it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.720 
frost blanket this is great stuff it's
light<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.000> airy<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.140> floats<00:02:28.860> over<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
light and airy so it floats over the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.240 
light and airy so it floats over the
tops<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> plants<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.050> has<00:02:31.800> great

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
tops of the plants it has great

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.880 
tops of the plants it has great
insulation<00:02:33.060> properties<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.140> yet<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
insulation properties and yet it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.650 
insulation properties and yet it
breathes<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.670> doesn't<00:02:36.030> collect<00:02:36.390> moisture

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
breathes so it doesn't collect moisture

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.800 
breathes so it doesn't collect moisture
underneath<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.740> best<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.610> all<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.060> allows

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
underneath and best of all it allows

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.290
