00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.140
 I tell you and I bring you some skins that are 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.449
 very good skins are extracted from the gta 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.430
 vice city good let's start with the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.780
 tutorial and do not worry all the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.850
 links of the tools that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 we will use today will be here 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.629
 down on the description of this stupid 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.699
 and sensual video first thing and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.680
 obviously obvious is to download the 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.629
 materials and the skins if they already have 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 materials do not have to download them 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.670
 obviously once the file is downloaded 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.739
 removable car we open it and look for 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.659
 where we want to extract the skins in my 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.790
 case on the desk then we give 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.189
 click on the extract button and we will have 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.470
 a folder where skins come for 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.119
 add the skins need the mod skin 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 selector that will also be in the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.380
 description of the video and to add them 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.960
 we need an editor img any in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.579
 my case i like more the crazy img editor 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 that I will also leave the link to 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.140
 download as you can see inside 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.479
 of the folder are the skins with the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 classic costumes from tome verzeri the skin 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.140
 from lanz bands 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.789
 to add them is very simple what 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.950
 first thing we have to do is open 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.899
 our crazy id to the folder that is 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 in the upper left and search 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.000
 the img file of skin selector 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.189
 and then go to the option to deploy 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.020
 and we will find the option to 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.969
 width replacement we give you click and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.069
 we open the skin folder that they want 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.409
 install and select the two files 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.179
 df efe and txt and click on 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.479
 open and we are adding like this 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.479
 successively 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.629
 then we closed the crazy img editor and 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.269
 ready they will have their skins installed 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.909
 correctly it is also worth mentioning that 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.040
 the skins have been created 100% by me 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.340
 extracted from the vice city and converted with 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.140
