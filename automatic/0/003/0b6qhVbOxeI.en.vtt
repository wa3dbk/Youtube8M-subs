00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.280
 ah 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.610
 but we're in a video tutorial 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.580
 real minute of how to make you hear 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.250
 I say reproduce the villagers and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.800
 it's very simple it 's a stone all the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.379
 since I think it does not matter how I know 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
 feel for 10 not framed and for 10 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.390
 by 10 and put doors around 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 I understand very well why, but that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.760
 it's not like I do not know maybe for it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.410
 they have intimidated intelligence 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.220
 artificial with something 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.030
 and well, they did not come out and we waited 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.190
 jesus to love does not last long we wait 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.190
 that is efficient has to be known not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.230
 sometimes I do not understand why now we're going 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.770
 you hope you wait 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.290
 It was pretty simple, I'm not going to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.980
 kill 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.750
 toma toma toma is that my mother 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.659
 I do not know why it does not work but we're going to 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.240
 do 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.070
 and the logic 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.260
 look, look, we have to go out 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.980

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.320

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.840
 you want from the heart is what salt I do not 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.900
 I know now now now now it's going 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.560

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.170
 that is fine 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.790
 You see, it's already quite simple and 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.290
 It was pretty cool 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.570
