the<00:03:08.860> right<00:03:09.010> side<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.340> my<00:03:09.370> face<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:10.030> coming<00:03:10.239> from

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the right side of my face is coming from

a window on the other side of the room

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.559 
a window on the other side of the room
adding<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.610> nice<00:03:12.819> fill<00:03:14.880> will<00:03:15.880> now<00:03:16.030> become<00:03:16.239> this

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
adding a nice fill will now become this

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.630 
adding a nice fill will now become this
far<00:03:16.810> let's<00:03:17.470> try<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.800> do<00:03:17.950> something<00:03:18.160> more

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
far let's try to do something more

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.220 
far let's try to do something more
interesting<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.690> hands

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
interesting with the hands

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.220 
interesting with the hands
I<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> page<00:03:21.099> turning<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.760> sort<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.060> nice

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
I think the page turning is sort of nice

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.559 
I think the page turning is sort of nice
maybe<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.410> need<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.590> do<00:03:23.769> something<00:03:24.480> where<00:03:25.480> you

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
maybe we need to do something where you

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.940 
maybe we need to do something where you
lean<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:25.810> your<00:03:26.080> fist<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.739> bit<00:03:26.860> or

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
lean on your fist a little bit or

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.830 
lean on your fist a little bit or
something<00:03:27.129> like<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.370> let's<00:03:27.700> try<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.150> I'm

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
something like that let's try that I'm

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.330 
something like that let's try that I'm
going<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.019> push<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.530> shutter<00:03:29.769> button<00:03:29.890> here

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
going to push the shutter button here

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:44.940 
going to push the shutter button here
again<00:03:42.959> that's<00:03:43.959> pretty<00:03:44.170> cool<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.680> can<00:03:44.739> see

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
again that's pretty cool you can see

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.440 
again that's pretty cool you can see
what<00:03:45.069> happens<00:03:45.400> when<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.579> use<00:03:45.760> your<00:03:45.940> hands<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
what happens when you use your hands and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.580 
what happens when you use your hands and
put<00:03:46.569> your<00:03:46.720> arms<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.049> different<00:03:47.319> directions

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
put your arms in different directions

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.140 
put your arms in different directions
the<00:03:47.829> changes<00:03:48.280> sort<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.640> shape<00:03:48.880> and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the changes sort of the shape and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.479 
the changes sort of the shape and
dynamics<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.110> body<00:03:53.069> okay<00:03:54.069> I<00:03:54.099> think<00:03:54.400> we've

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
dynamics of the body okay I think we've

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.039 
dynamics of the body okay I think we've
done<00:03:54.700> sort<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.030> an<00:03:55.090> interesting<00:03:55.569> shot<00:03:55.780> going

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
done sort of an interesting shot going

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.539 
done sort of an interesting shot going
on<00:03:56.230> here<00:03:56.500> I'm<00:03:56.739> going<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.099> one<00:03:57.310> more<00:03:57.340> thing

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
on here I'm going to do one more thing

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.890 
on here I'm going to do one more thing
because<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.180> think<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.450> adds<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.690> lot<00:03:58.840> of

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
because I think it adds a lot of

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.569 
because I think it adds a lot of
interest<00:03:59.019> we're<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.739> be<00:03:59.920> turning<00:04:00.489> the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
interest we're going to be turning the

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.150 
interest we're going to be turning the
page<00:04:00.870> I'm<00:04:01.870> also<00:04:02.139> going<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.620> take<00:04:02.829> my<00:04:02.980> glasses

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
page I'm also going to take my glasses

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.920 
page I'm also going to take my glasses
off<00:04:03.549> like<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.180> gives<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> little<00:04:04.720> more

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
off like this it gives it a little more

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.390 
off like this it gives it a little more
sense<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.319> immediacy<00:04:06.030> let's<00:04:07.030> try<00:04:07.299> that<00:04:08.400> I'm

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
sense of immediacy let's try that I'm

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.979 
sense of immediacy let's try that I'm
gonna<00:04:09.549> go<00:04:09.700> through<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.000> again<00:04:10.060> dart<00:04:10.870> the

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
gonna go through this again dart the

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:21.810 
gonna go through this again dart the
camera<00:04:13.079> okay

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.900 

and<00:04:22.960> here's<00:04:23.960> our<00:04:24.170> final<00:04:24.440> shot<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.460> really<00:04:25.880> a

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
and here's our final shot it's really a

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.060 
and here's our final shot it's really a
nice<00:04:26.150> staged<00:04:26.510> portrait<00:04:27.170> one<00:04:27.470> last<00:04:27.740> thing<00:04:27.980> I'm

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
nice staged portrait one last thing I'm

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.530 
nice staged portrait one last thing I'm
going<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.280> do<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.700> turn<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.000> into<00:04:29.180> black<00:04:29.510> and

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
going to do is turn it into black and

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.280
