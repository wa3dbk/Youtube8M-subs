 but come 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.490
 I am very curious I see according to 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.020
 me that a lipstick at sentence 'this is not 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:31.290
 you never have enough he is killed this 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 time with blue will be out for a moment 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.100
 I see so that the paint is orange from 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.330
 A union union is how you get it right 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.300
 pronounce 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.010
 did you not how do you think it will be whole 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 look nice 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.830
 and this is just very nice in the summer 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.600
 color 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.420
 I'm not very much into the right one 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.370
 will kind of orange toenails down that 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.730
 the order is a plus in a bit 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.530
 this is really kind of a bright orange 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.040
 nail you but I am very sorry 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 curious 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:08.230
 so this is a fake sit too 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:11.739
 a very large and brief look 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.019
 you are job board catchy and then four 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.250
 colors and a matte top coat 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.810
 well what a top coat to be very useful 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.630
 this is how it looks 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.269
 indeed you have a whole package 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 And so this side just suggested 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.470
 another color of check here in the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.060
 future buy one i can have this content 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.430
 high enough 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.550
 this is very nice looks very nice 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.660
 from the new van wanted package 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.190
 and then also the bourjois and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.190
 and look at this is the 0 7 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.470
 his honorary park , by the way 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.570
 I can take a whole minute to do this 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.610
 it's very brown and chic colors there 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.720
 is also something constructive and therefore up to you 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.250
 phone but do techno skill 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.570
 and focus 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.630
 but I will show it to me 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:24.850
 so lipstick spice looks very little 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:29.170
 and this is how the nail polish looks at home so I do again 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.120
 very nice product or whatever I think 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.640
 not really saying wow really 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.340
 a full barge heavy living room corridor can 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.320
 go on and on this that I work and it 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.720
 reeds in my butcher shop so nail polish can 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.880
 I didn't actually stop very long 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.440
 such as down these two nail 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.970
 but they will actually have to be there soon 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.560
 pick up now 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.200
 because I have to succeed and there 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.720
 it works so it's a bit of a shame 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.000
 but no different so and change 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.260
 people is a lot of fun, I'm 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.910
 very curious what you think of the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.919
 Partybox vondel that you are too cute 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.690
 content found or not 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.790
 and I'm going to take another picture of one 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.590
 number of products and in a whole day 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.000
 home alone so you can do good where 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.530
 I myself feel like I can nice and long 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.980
 on my videos without being disturbed 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.350
 is becoming 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.240
 so in itself it is nice if you too 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.040
 wonder why I can do this other 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.169
 harvested all that noise I just got one 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.490
 book made a summer look 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.140
 so if you don't have that video yet 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.730
 seen then you have to go a little further 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.470
 look around a channel and then i'll see you 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.470
 want to return soon next time
