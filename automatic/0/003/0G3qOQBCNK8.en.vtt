some<00:00:17.880> attacks<00:00:18.210> using<00:00:18.750> Erasmus<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.590> well<00:00:20.040> as

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
some attacks using Erasmus as well as

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.390 
some attacks using Erasmus as well as
sicu<00:00:20.700> now<00:00:21.450> this<00:00:21.630> first<00:00:21.869> base<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.650> believe<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
sicu now this first base I believe is a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.749 
sicu now this first base I believe is a
maxed-out<00:00:23.939> stronghold<00:00:24.900> level<00:00:25.140> 15<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:26.550> don't

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
maxed-out stronghold level 15 they don't

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.359 
maxed-out stronghold level 15 they don't
have<00:00:26.910> Sentinel<00:00:27.540> so<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.230> normal<00:00:28.739> hit

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
have Sentinel so it's just normal hit

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.479 
have Sentinel so it's just normal hit
points<00:00:29.700> on<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.450> defenses<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> here

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
points on this on the defenses so here

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.550 
points on this on the defenses so here
I'm<00:00:32.579> using<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.940> Rasmus<00:00:33.470> it's<00:00:34.470> a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
I'm using a Rasmus it's a

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.740 
I'm using a Rasmus it's a
doughnut-shaped<00:00:35.280> base<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.300> hard<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> keep

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
doughnut-shaped base it's hard to keep

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.090 
doughnut-shaped base it's hard to keep
your<00:00:36.810> troops<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.350> walking<00:00:37.739> around<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
your troops from walking around in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.299 
your troops from walking around in
circles<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.720> dropping<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.350> vez

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
circles so here I'm dropping my vez

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.460 
circles so here I'm dropping my vez
carrier<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.030> south<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> dragon<00:00:43.260> roost

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
carrier in the south on the dragon roost

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.560 
carrier in the south on the dragon roost
and<00:00:43.740> as<00:00:44.250> soon<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.640> destroyed<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.390> will

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and as soon as that's destroyed I will

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.840 
and as soon as that's destroyed I will
sweep<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.990> to<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> far<00:00:46.470> north<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.670> some

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
sweep it to the far north to do some

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.690 
sweep it to the far north to do some
damage<00:00:48.030> over<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> base<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.080> by<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> time<00:00:50.310> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
damage over the base and by that time it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.550 
damage over the base and by that time it
should<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.090> enough<00:00:51.570> recharge<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
should have enough recharge to do a

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.760 
should have enough recharge to do a
second<00:00:53.010> swoop<00:00:53.720> I'm<00:00:54.720> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> sweep<00:00:55.290> over<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
second swoop I'm going to sweep over the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.040 
second swoop I'm going to sweep over the
base<00:00:55.950> now<00:00:56.250> you'll<00:00:57.030> notice<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.420> using<00:00:57.450> three

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
base now you'll notice I'm using three

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.400 
base now you'll notice I'm using three
squads<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> soldiers<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.820> paladin<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> two

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
squads of soldiers one paladin and two

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.539 
squads of soldiers one paladin and two
wardens<00:01:02.240> just<00:01:03.240> a<00:01:03.329> lot<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.630> Mellie<00:01:03.840> troops<00:01:04.170> here

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
wardens just a lot of Mellie troops here

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.469 
wardens just a lot of Mellie troops here
so<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> start<00:01:06.299> getting

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so now I'm going to start getting

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719 
so now I'm going to start getting
through<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> walls<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:08.100> melly<00:01:08.369> trips

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
through the walls using my melly trips

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
through the walls using my melly trips
only<00:01:08.880> I've<00:01:09.659> saved<00:01:09.960> my<00:01:10.259> wardens<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.950> last

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
only I've saved my wardens to last

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
only I've saved my wardens to last
because<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> tendency<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.780> walking

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because they have a tendency of walking

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
because they have a tendency of walking
around<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> outside<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.460> those<00:01:14.549> walls<00:01:14.880> it's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
around the outside of those walls it's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
around the outside of those walls it's
another<00:01:16.049> sweep<00:01:16.380> coming<00:01:16.740> down<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.340> have

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
another sweep coming down now I have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.789 
another sweep coming down now I have
enough<00:01:17.789> for<00:01:17.969> one<00:01:18.090> more<00:01:18.299> swoop<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.350> I'll<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.590> two

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
enough for one more swoop so I'll do two

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
enough for one more swoop so I'll do two
here<00:01:20.069> in<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.219> row<00:01:20.399> now<00:01:20.869> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.929> drop<00:01:22.049> quickly

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
here in a row now going to drop quickly

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.279 
here in a row now going to drop quickly
drop<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.859> my<00:01:23.609> wardens<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> help<00:01:24.780> take<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.139> the

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
drop in my wardens to help take down the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.859 
drop in my wardens to help take down the
defenses<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.039> drop<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.179> remaining<00:01:27.659> troops

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
defenses there drop the remaining troops

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
defenses there drop the remaining troops
inside<00:01:28.319> followed<00:01:29.009> by<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.249> refraction<00:01:29.759> spell

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
inside followed by the refraction spell

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
inside followed by the refraction spell
so<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.619> where<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.249> the<00:01:32.399> damage<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so this is where a lot of the damage is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.309 
so this is where a lot of the damage is
going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> reflected<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> these

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
going to be reflected back to these

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.940 
going to be reflected back to these
defenses<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.700> you'll<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:35.999> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> those

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
defenses and you'll see a lot of those

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.989 
defenses and you'll see a lot of those
defenses<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.100> course<00:01:38.399> start<00:01:38.670> dropping

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
defenses in the course start dropping

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.840 
defenses in the course start dropping
like<00:01:39.149> flies<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.979> bulk<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.399> troops<00:01:41.729> are

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
like flies the bulk of my troops are

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.199 
like flies the bulk of my troops are
walking<00:01:42.329> around<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.749> outer<00:01:43.560> layer<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
walking around the outer layer there so

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.239 
walking around the outer layer there so
I<00:01:45.569> have<00:01:45.780> saved<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.319> lot<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.590> my<00:01:46.679> manner<00:01:46.889> i<00:01:46.979> can

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
I have saved up a lot of my manner i can

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.550 
I have saved up a lot of my manner i can
start<00:01:47.549> dropping<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.119> refraction<00:01:49.049> spells<00:01:49.380> on

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
start dropping more refraction spells on

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
start dropping more refraction spells on
them<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.490> there's<00:01:50.700> nothing<00:01:50.999> much<00:01:51.179> in<00:01:51.479> range

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
them but there's nothing much in range

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
them but there's nothing much in range
so<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> am<00:01:52.229> saving<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.979> until<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.399> break

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so I am saving that up until they break

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.179 
so I am saving that up until they break
through<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.060> walls<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> fortunately<00:01:55.889> after

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
through the walls so fortunately after

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
through the walls so fortunately after
they<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.759> past<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.329> Watchtower<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:58.170> start

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
they get past this Watchtower they start

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.370 
they get past this Watchtower they start
popping<00:01:58.889> in<00:01:59.329> so<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.600> am<00:02:00.749> ready<00:02:00.959> on<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
popping in so I am ready on the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
popping in so I am ready on the
refraction<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.279> as<00:02:02.429> they<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.700> near<00:02:02.999> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
refraction just as they get near the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.379 
refraction just as they get near the
spell<00:02:03.990> towers<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.759> can't<00:02:05.759> quite<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.149> close

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
spell towers I can't quite get close

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.330 
spell towers I can't quite get close
enough<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> fire<00:02:07.439> spell<00:02:07.829> taos<00:02:08.099> I've

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
enough to that fire spell taos I've

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
enough to that fire spell taos I've
dropped<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:08.849> allusions<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> distract<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
dropped some allusions to distract that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.130 
dropped some allusions to distract that
and<00:02:10.819> now<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:12.060> enough<00:02:12.300> mana<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> drop<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and now have enough mana to drop the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809 
and now have enough mana to drop the
refraction<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.770> more<00:02:13.920> time<00:02:14.190> which<00:02:14.610> quickly

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
refraction one more time which quickly

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.780 
refraction one more time which quickly
takes<00:02:15.209> down<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.599> remaining<00:02:15.959> defenses<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.920> max

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
takes down the remaining defenses so max

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.960 
takes down the remaining defenses so max
base<00:02:18.350> with<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.590> Erasmus<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> came<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.790> pretty

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
base with the Erasmus it came in pretty

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.250 
base with the Erasmus it came in pretty
handy<00:02:21.210> here<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:22.350> all<00:02:22.470> depends<00:02:22.830> on

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
handy here it all depends on

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.660 
handy here it all depends on
design<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.769> base<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.620> moving<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:27.159> to<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
design of the base so moving on to the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.500 
design of the base so moving on to the
next<00:02:28.420> attack<00:02:28.629> now<00:02:29.610> I'm<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.760> against<00:02:31.299> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
next attack now I'm up against a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
next attack now I'm up against a
sentinel<00:02:32.379> with<00:02:32.530> twenty-five<00:02:33.159> percent<00:02:33.370> bonus

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
sentinel with twenty-five percent bonus

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.850 
sentinel with twenty-five percent bonus
hit<00:02:34.090> points<00:02:34.510> which<00:02:34.870> makes<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> quite

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
hit points which makes it quite

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.699 
hit points which makes it quite
difficult<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:37.390> with<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.659> base<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.319> like<00:02:38.680> to

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
difficult now with this base I like to

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.559 
difficult now with this base I like to
use<00:02:39.099> sicu<00:02:40.140> because<00:02:41.140> she<00:02:41.349> has<00:02:41.560> very<00:02:41.799> good<00:02:42.569> spelt

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
use sicu because she has very good spelt

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.860 
use sicu because she has very good spelt
our<00:02:43.810> abilities<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.670> north<00:02:45.879> here<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.480> very

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
our abilities so the north here is very

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.080 
our abilities so the north here is very
easy<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.319> get<00:02:47.440> through<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.799> walls<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.909> can

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
easy to get through the walls and I can

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.240 
easy to get through the walls and I can
do<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.390> without<00:02:49.599> getting<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.349> within<00:02:51.010> range

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
do that without getting in within range

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.220 
do that without getting in within range
of<00:02:51.519> those<00:02:51.670> spelt<00:02:52.030> hours<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.659> I'm<00:02:52.750> dropping<00:02:53.049> all

of my trips here at once I can safely
get<00:02:55.780> through<00:02:55.989> these<00:02:56.170> walls<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.769> just<00:02:57.670> as<00:02:57.879> they

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
together for this so I'm also counting

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.080 
together for this so I'm also counting
in<00:03:16.840> my<00:03:16.930> head<00:03:17.139> around<00:03:17.409> ten<00:03:17.709> seconds<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.879> we'll

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
in my head around ten seconds so we'll

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.330 
in my head around ten seconds so we'll
drop<00:03:19.299> another<00:03:19.720> spell<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.950> make<00:03:21.099> sure<00:03:21.129> I

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
drop another spell just to make sure I

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.940 
drop another spell just to make sure I
don't<00:03:21.519> take<00:03:21.879> any<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.709> freeze<00:03:23.709> damage

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
don't take any of that freeze damage

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.910 
don't take any of that freeze damage
from<00:03:24.310> those<00:03:24.930> spell<00:03:25.930> towels<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:26.500> conduits

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
from those spell towels on the conduits

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.250 
from those spell towels on the conduits
as<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.150> see<00:03:28.359> I<00:03:28.389> didn't<00:03:28.690> have<00:03:28.810> any<00:03:29.049> trouble

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
as you can see I didn't have any trouble

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.890 
as you can see I didn't have any trouble
at<00:03:29.590> all<00:03:29.709> getting<00:03:30.519> down<00:03:30.879> those<00:03:31.120> spell<00:03:31.480> towers

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
at all getting down those spell towers

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.199 
at all getting down those spell towers
so<00:03:32.680> now<00:03:32.829> I<00:03:32.859> just<00:03:32.980> need<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.280> worry<00:03:33.579> about<00:03:33.849> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
so now I just need to worry about the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.879 
so now I just need to worry about the
rest<00:03:34.359> of<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.599> defenses<00:03:35.139> and<00:03:35.410> i'll<00:03:35.560> use<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
rest of the defenses and i'll use the

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.699 
rest of the defenses and i'll use the
area<00:03:36.340> spell<00:03:36.699> to<00:03:37.209> confuse<00:03:37.660> all<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.109> targets<00:03:38.319> in

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
area spell to confuse all the targets in

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.159 
area spell to confuse all the targets in
the<00:03:38.829> area<00:03:39.040> for<00:03:39.069> seven<00:03:39.489> seconds<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.269> this<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.109> a

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
the area for seven seconds so this is a

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.960 
the area for seven seconds so this is a
very<00:03:41.410> effective<00:03:41.530> spell<00:03:42.190> once<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.760> spell

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
very effective spell once the spell

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.780 
very effective spell once the spell
towels<00:03:43.239> have<00:03:43.480> been<00:03:43.629> taken<00:03:43.989> down<00:03:44.549> so<00:03:45.549> not<00:03:45.699> much

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
towels have been taken down so not much

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.640 
towels have been taken down so not much
trouble<00:03:46.150> from<00:03:46.269> here<00:03:46.449> on<00:03:46.599> because<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.169> yo

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
trouble from here on because all the yo

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.740 
trouble from here on because all the yo
defenses<00:03:48.220> are<00:03:48.340> attacking<00:03:48.579> each<00:03:48.790> other<00:03:48.970> so

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750

damage to a medium area over five

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.089 
damage to a medium area over five
seconds<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.359> effective<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:02.099> defenses

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
seconds so it is effective on defenses

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.550 
seconds so it is effective on defenses
and<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.459> walls<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:03.940> well<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.139> is<00:04:05.290> 10

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560

village here has a ten percent Sentinel

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.379 
village here has a ten percent Sentinel
bonus<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:18.070> it'll<00:04:18.190> be<00:04:18.220> ten<00:04:18.489> percent<00:04:18.820> harder<00:04:19.299> to

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
bonus so it'll be ten percent harder to

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.050 
bonus so it'll be ten percent harder to
take<00:04:19.570> down<00:04:19.720> these<00:04:19.930> towers<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.519> this<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.030> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
take down these towers and this is a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.240 
take down these towers and this is a
different<00:04:22.419> designer<00:04:22.720> gain<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.409> there's<00:04:24.190> a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
different designer gain and there's a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.770 
different designer gain and there's a
lot<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.460> distractions<00:04:24.849> around<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.360> outside

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
lot of distractions around the outside

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.870 
lot of distractions around the outside
so<00:04:26.050> once<00:04:26.229> again<00:04:26.380> i<00:04:26.620> will<00:04:26.800> switch<00:04:27.130> on<00:04:27.280> over<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.849> a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
so once again i will switch on over to a

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.709 
so once again i will switch on over to a
Rasmus<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:30.030> there's<00:04:31.030> some<00:04:31.180> areas<00:04:31.510> here<00:04:31.690> where

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 
Rasmus so there's some areas here where

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.659 
Rasmus so there's some areas here where
I<00:04:31.870> can<00:04:31.930> deploy<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.620> dragon<00:04:33.070> where<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.430> can't

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
I can deploy the dragon where it can't

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.020 
I can deploy the dragon where it can't
be<00:04:33.820> attacked<00:04:34.090> by<00:04:34.150> defenses

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
be attacked by defenses

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.940 
be attacked by defenses
we'll<00:04:35.300> carefully<00:04:35.630> drop<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.230> right<00:04:36.410> here<00:04:36.770> on

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
we'll carefully drop it right here on

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.310 
we'll carefully drop it right here on
this<00:04:37.130> building<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:38.660> building<00:04:38.960> has<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.110> lot<00:04:39.290> of

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
this building the building has a lot of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.320 
this building the building has a lot of
hit<00:04:39.470> points<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.220> can<00:04:40.280> build<00:04:40.670> up<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:41.030> lot<00:04:41.300> of

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
hit points so I can build up a lot of

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.780 
hit points so I can build up a lot of
recharge<00:04:41.990> on<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.260> dragon<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.460> as<00:04:43.520> soon<00:04:43.670> as

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
recharge on the dragon so as soon as

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.690 
recharge on the dragon so as soon as
that<00:04:43.970> has<00:04:44.770> taken<00:04:45.770> down<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.250> building<00:04:46.460> I'll

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
that has taken down that building I'll

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.060 
that has taken down that building I'll
sweep<00:04:47.000> across<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.360> base<00:04:47.720> as<00:04:48.440> far<00:04:48.740> right<00:04:49.040> as

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
sweep across the base as far right as

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.350 
sweep across the base as far right as
possible<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:51.050> speed<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.470> up<00:04:51.620> here<00:04:52.240> but<00:04:53.240> there

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
possible so speed this up here but there

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.790 
possible so speed this up here but there
is<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.480> watch<00:04:53.750> tower<00:04:53.990> on<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.200> other<00:04:54.350> side<00:04:54.560> so

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
is a watch tower on the other side so

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.390 
is a watch tower on the other side so
we'll<00:04:54.920> deploy<00:04:55.220> one<00:04:55.700> squad<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.270> wardens<00:04:56.690> to

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
we'll deploy one squad of wardens to

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.860 
we'll deploy one squad of wardens to
make<00:04:58.400> sure<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.580> dragon<00:04:59.090> doesn't<00:04:59.240> get<00:04:59.420> damaged

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
make sure my dragon doesn't get damaged

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.040 
make sure my dragon doesn't get damaged
I'll<00:05:00.560> drop<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.890> right<00:05:01.100> now<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.870> let's

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
I'll drop that right now so let's

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.710 
I'll drop that right now so let's
distract<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.590> from<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.950> dragon<00:05:04.570> dragon<00:05:05.570> does

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
distract it from the dragon dragon does

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.840 
distract it from the dragon dragon does
have<00:05:05.990> almost<00:05:06.260> two<00:05:06.560> recharges<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.310> can<00:05:07.580> sweep

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
have almost two recharges so I can sweep

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.750 
have almost two recharges so I can sweep
back<00:05:08.060> across<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.600> base<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:10.310> I'll<00:05:10.430> do<00:05:10.640> that

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
back across the base and I'll do that

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.950 
back across the base and I'll do that
right<00:05:11.150> now<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:14.000> this<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.210> going<00:05:14.390> to<00:05:14.510> damage<00:05:14.720> a

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
right now so this is going to damage a

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.800 
right now so this is going to damage a
lot<00:05:15.170> of<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.380> buildings<00:05:15.590> across<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.220> core

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
lot of the buildings across the core

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.060 
lot of the buildings across the core
your<00:05:17.810> biggest<00:05:18.050> stretch<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.530> dragons<00:05:18.950> are

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
your biggest stretch of the dragons are

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.190 
your biggest stretch of the dragons are
the<00:05:19.600> watchtowers<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.630> there<00:05:20.930> aren't<00:05:21.080> that

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
the watchtowers and there aren't that

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.650 
the watchtowers and there aren't that
many<00:05:21.260> in<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.740> core<00:05:21.980> so<00:05:22.760> my<00:05:22.880> dragon<00:05:23.270> does<00:05:23.420> last

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
many in the core so my dragon does last

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.770 
many in the core so my dragon does last
three<00:05:24.050> whole<00:05:24.230> swoops<00:05:24.620> there<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.150> almost<00:05:26.150> got

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
three whole swoops there I almost got

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.510 
three whole swoops there I almost got
one<00:05:26.990> more<00:05:27.140> charge<00:05:27.470> left<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.070> didn't<00:05:28.370> quite

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
one more charge left and I didn't quite

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.880 
one more charge left and I didn't quite
take<00:05:28.760> down<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.030> skywatcher<00:05:29.930> inside<00:05:30.290> that

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
take down that skywatcher inside that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.130 
take down that skywatcher inside that
was<00:05:31.100> my<00:05:31.310> objective<00:05:31.850> so<00:05:32.480> I've<00:05:32.600> just<00:05:32.630> have

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
was my objective so I've just have

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.960 
was my objective so I've just have
enough<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.530> sweep<00:05:33.710> across<00:05:33.950> here<00:05:34.370> which<00:05:34.760> also

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
enough to sweep across here which also

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.350 
enough to sweep across here which also
triggers<00:05:35.510> off<00:05:35.690> all<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.140> spell<00:05:36.470> towers<00:05:37.360> so

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
triggers off all of the spell towers so

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.820 
triggers off all of the spell towers so
now<00:05:38.510> it's<00:05:38.660> safe<00:05:38.870> for<00:05:38.990> me<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.200> quickly<00:05:39.410> deploy

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
now it's safe for me to quickly deploy

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.500
