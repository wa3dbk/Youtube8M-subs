now<00:00:00.299> look<00:00:00.630> at<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.840> numbers<00:00:01.199> on<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.469> bag<00:00:01.700> 5<00:00:02.700> 10

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
now look at the numbers on the bag 5 10

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.120 
now look at the numbers on the bag 5 10
5<00:00:03.629> anybody<00:00:04.470> know<00:00:04.589> what<00:00:04.680> those<00:00:04.799> numbers

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
5 anybody know what those numbers

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.509 
5 anybody know what those numbers
represent<00:00:06.529> nitrogen<00:00:07.529> phosphorus<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
represent nitrogen phosphorus in the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.780 
represent nitrogen phosphorus in the
passage<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.870> 17<00:00:10.710> nutrients<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.490> plant

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
passage of the 17 nutrients that a plant

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.049 
passage of the 17 nutrients that a plant
needs<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.420> live<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.929> P<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.040> K<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> most

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
needs to live and P and K are the most

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.330 
needs to live and P and K are the most
essential<00:00:15.360> absolutely<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.830> most<00:00:17.010> essential

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
essential absolutely the most essential

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.019 
essential absolutely the most essential
and<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.300> way<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> think<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
and the way I like to think about it is

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.279 
and the way I like to think about it is
up<00:00:21.029> down<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:23.010> around<00:00:23.779> nitrogen<00:00:24.779> contributes

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
up down all around nitrogen contributes

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
up down all around nitrogen contributes
to<00:00:25.619> grow<00:00:26.189> upwards<00:00:27.199> phosphorus<00:00:28.880> all<00:00:29.880> around

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to grow upwards phosphorus all around

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.330 
to grow upwards phosphorus all around
vascular<00:00:31.019> tissues<00:00:31.500> throughout<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> plant

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
vascular tissues throughout the plant

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.299 
vascular tissues throughout the plant
and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.210> potassium<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and then potassium down that's going to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.900 
and then potassium down that's going to
be<00:00:35.430> most<00:00:35.640> important<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:41.059> absolutely<00:00:43.850> okay<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
be most important for absolutely okay so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
be most important for absolutely okay so
one<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> things<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> first<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
one of the things is first of all the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
one of the things is first of all the
average<00:00:47.340> person<00:00:47.760> does<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.420> feed<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.530> average

person<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.190> ask<00:00:50.340> people<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:50.789> his<00:00:50.940> last<00:00:51.180> 10<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
person I ask people when his last 10 you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.660 
person I ask people when his last 10 you
for<00:00:51.690> life<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.320> know<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
for life I don't know you know for the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
for life I don't know you know for the
people<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.090> serious<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.960> these

people that are serious about it these

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.660 
people that are serious about it these
are<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> things<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.340> would<00:00:56.489> say

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
are some of the things I would say

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.799 
are some of the things I would say
nitrogen<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> most<00:00:58.199> essential<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> spring

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
nitrogen is most essential in the spring

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.450 
nitrogen is most essential in the spring
phosphorus<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.109> potassium<00:01:01.350> tend<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.340> more

phosphorus and potassium tend to be more

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
phosphorus and potassium tend to be more

soil<00:01:51.979> there's<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.940> couple<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.270> things<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.509> I

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
soil there's a couple of things that I

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.389 
soil there's a couple of things that I
said<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.320> first<00:01:54.560> thing<00:01:54.740> you'd<00:01:54.860> want<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.130> do<00:01:55.250> is

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
said the first thing you'd want to do is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.520 
said the first thing you'd want to do is
when<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.729> plant<00:01:56.090> your<00:01:56.300> rose<00:01:56.540> make<00:01:57.259> sure<00:01:57.440> you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
when you plant your rose make sure you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.810 
when you plant your rose make sure you
dig<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.800> big<00:01:59.080> petal<00:02:00.080> mitigation<00:02:00.680> use<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:01.580> lot<00:02:01.790> of

dig a big petal mitigation use a lot of

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.460 
dig a big petal mitigation use a lot of
organic<00:02:02.000> matter<00:02:02.420> because<00:02:02.840> combining<00:02:03.350> with
