00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.700
 for the anniversary to the champions from 2013 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.400
 it was already announced by me 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.690
 already said before and I already had 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.230
 asked in the interview if I do that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 will do 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.970
 and this is now the time 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 official video to be noticed as 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.340
 commentator guest commentary intended yes 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.079
 so we thought we did 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.000
 different rules and laws 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.219
 set up as the royal take place 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.450
 and that andi should you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.930
 Keep that is here for example now 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.210
 for the participation the right tournament 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 video so when the tournament takes place 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 you can come here first 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:57.539
 Sign up and join in , says Andy 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.070
 First of all, borg has the program for 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.300
 The game, of course, can indeed her 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.649
 should of course hugo can you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.840
 should be relatively familiar with the rules 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.090
 and if not then look 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.140
 you have a little bit of that on her 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.119
 otherwise it will not work 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 yes i will i dont like you too 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.189
 explain why so please go I like 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.369
 you the question 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 Second, you should do that 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.520
 tournament program do not worry that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.009
 tournament program but the organic bread there 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.409
 will take place the whole tournament 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.000
 So the whole game 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.700
 Worry that I have a link 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.100
 I sent you the deer link to the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 rule and rightly forbidden and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.880
 he is with limited edition cards 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.829
 Everything is written in the table 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.810
 the description you can everything from there 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.189
 get out nexus s will be after ours 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.290
 rules so if youtube 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.369
 pro has switched off the rules impact 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.540
 explained by that now I believe one 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.479
 a little better because I'm not sure 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:00.180
 I know that the program shows me 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.979
 can ok then i will give you one in one 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.810
 extra video that is or her son 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.450
 advance notice video yes in the front 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.640
 then announcement video 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.869
 if not then just look that is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 not difficult to find 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.030
 I do a knack if the game costs like 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680
 said rule is there so after 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.519
 what rules has played which will 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.599
 dix are not desired which dix 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.160
 may contain which cards and 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.950
 which is not all that on the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.870
 website keyword the tv and then still 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 I have extra kieble the tv link with 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.709
 prohibited and limited cards list 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.849
 sent so that really no one confused 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.560
 That's why it's good 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.160
 The tournament application is up to date 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.450
 30 08 2013 you notice the date for 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.620
 later , later, then goes 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.299
 but somehow believe me 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.810
 I do not mean that he will go along later 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:03:00.360
 Apply well next if you want 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.530
 You do not write me a pn 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.209
 write in the comments 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.310
 You may ask more in the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.750
 not all comments 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.819
 please ask but you can ask me 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.720
 Make applications only go to me 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.190
 at pm 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.590
 he writes me your skype name 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.940
 and your real name you can me 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.049
 of course donate but then 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.780
 you must have written me too 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.829
 that you wrote me ne pn 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.250
 that right I think so 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.410
 All right so mark you the standing 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.170
 everything in the description as 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.350
 Next the tournament games will be so in 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.859
 take place around 16 to 18 o'clock 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.230
 just as a little time so you guys 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.030
 you can remember that so you yourselves 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.590
 Therefore, you can divide time 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.459
 more exact date is not yet for that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.829
 tournament 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.269
 We want to participate first 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.299
 If there are not enough submissions have 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.730
 are okay then not under accurate 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.470
 time will of course also with the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.069
 Participants of this place ever 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.630
 discussed 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.250
 Exactly good next tournament bigger 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.299
 will still vary depending on how many 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.910
 participants sign up 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.450
 that means we do group games 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.720
 And if there are enough participants 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.859
 make it 16 people will be then 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.989
 there are four groups 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.800
 if there are many more people then 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.120
 there are 32 people and that will be one 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.690
 as in the World Cup in football 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:25.820
 So made eight groups of groups each 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.950
 on how many will be contacting some 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.180
 it's harder for us, too 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.300
 now to many will sign up then 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.710
 Of course, that's a bit harder for us 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.720
 because of course only 24 will come out 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.040
 the now 16 people tournament and I have to 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.080
 but a few people will leave 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.790
 Randomly done nothing against 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.070
 personally or somehow something 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.960
 personal that of course i will 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.300
 Then take it out because I have it 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.250
 hate as well as sixth i and 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.340
 mirko will both tournament me that 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.510
 games as well as be commentators 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.930
 nothing there you can not do anything me and 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:04.520
 logo know us relatively with video 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.740
 mosbe I think a little better but there 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.810
 we do not do that for me i know myself 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.490
 With the new cards are homosexuality 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.070
 and a little bit more out of there 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.180
 He will help me then, for example 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.700
 we will be there for the tournaments though 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.470
 thanks to the video, that's not the case 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.380
 be bad note stop only on whether 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.690
 the cards then if then the right ones 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.390
 cards are as it is in the rules 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.030
 is and then stops commentators 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.350
 be that since our tournament is then 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.500
 we have to comment with 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.870
 we'll be fine too, of course 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.310
 join in but they will not 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.480
 be the same dome 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.860
 that will happen by chance 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.930
 but mostly we do it that way 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.480
 that I'm a group leader or user 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.470
 group leader has the other two white 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.450
 I do not care if I am a group leader 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.690
 to do 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.190
 we have to see visitors looking for 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.890
 the people do not use my rules 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:59.419
 get along or with the cards liste.de 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.470
 it is not allowed to over it 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.419
 express because we are not with yes it is just 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.720
 our tournament is not someone 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.740
 other things have is our game 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.660
 We do not want to be at the tournament 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.630
 on rain and it just have to clear 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.980
 rules exist for that and only that in 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.320
 the point with the confused cards zb 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.350
 even if they look like they are forbidden 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.760
 but also for us, yes, if we are like that 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.370
 we would have to play as well 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.169
 be disqualified 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.729
 So that 's clear we have to be exact 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.720
 Keep it as good as yours 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.510
 It should be at tournament match it too 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.850
 I would like you to come late 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.190
 that will deny us at least two 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.210
 hours ago so that should not be 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.750
 you will be the case automatically 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:46.229
 disqualified and your opponent 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.720
 then get the points 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.610
 the odeg correct moment rule the 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.949
 usually like a bit nasty maybe 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.889
 sound but must say it has to be somewhere 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.970
 a clear structure very ism 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.190
 be organized that's just in 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.860
 In this case, something even looser 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.400
 Then yes, then it will become 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.830
 explain everything and everyone has to somehow 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.720
 you do that well people look at you 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.220
 the rule if you want to join 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.169
 do not write cross 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.360
 I 'm looking forward to it mirko 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:20.789
 hopefully as tense as one 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.789
 Flitzebogen the flitzer is tense 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.090
 there is still a video coming when that 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.889
 tournament will take place exactly 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.050
 and it will be more accurate 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.240
 discussed because of the delay and all 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.580
 you do that with 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.580
 until then ciao title
