00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.290

 of the top five peach fans five nights at 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:26.880
 freddy's won't love to understand 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:29.480
 that it is very dirty and drove on the fifth 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 place of our top is located 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 interesting fan version is called she he 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.890
 of 3d 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 well and this bath freddys 3 d 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 why 3d well because animatronics 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.969
 more realistic also the movement they have 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.809
 more corrected there too 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.710
 Foxy example up to ordinary fnaf 1 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.789
 she comes and yells namely in this fan 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.980
 the version it comes to you is screaming and straight 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.650
 right for you they are just 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.890
 peeking coming to you and right away 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.299
 the camera switches to the whole head 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 terrible foxy and at the same time she still 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.150
 yelling in general in the game you anyway 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:26.580

 not even an anime lover I would even say 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.750
 the fact that the same mime horror game 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.259
 which I have met for all my time in 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.040
 the game will be followed by girls disguised as 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.189
 animatronics and they kill us otherwise 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.710
 way that is, they choke us about what I 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.159

 hint recently on your channel 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.310
 youtube i played this fan version who don't 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.080

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:03.520
 many tab that is you are watching 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.469
 top 5 and then you see it 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.949
 Wonderful video I like it too 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:12.379
 and so what do you do for a game is a game with 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.430
 freddy's reduced 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:19.159
 but only 4 laps are bad with english 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.639
 don't even know who it is but oh well so 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:25.930
 Why I chose this game because well, 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:30.889
 that it reminds a bit of the engine 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:35.389
 fnaf third there are many such functions 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.180
 where do you need gas 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:41.060
 someone to wear such an iron mask 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.449
 lattice I don't know what these guys are later 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.719
 you still need to charge the battery or 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.710
 something like that charge these cameras well 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.930
 and just wondering also I chose this 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.800
 the game for first place in the top but because 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:02.719
 there is just a creepy atmosphere creepy 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.919
 screamer screamers are full of 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.740
 screamers of these all 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.319
 animatronics then there is someone screaming 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.789
 someone comes from the table someone 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:17.750
 passes by saying that oh dude to you 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:21.620
 a star as though I think something that is already 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.750
 time to finish guys all thanks i 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.580
