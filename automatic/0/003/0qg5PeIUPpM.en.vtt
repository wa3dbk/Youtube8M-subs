there's a couple bolts it bolt into the
valve<00:01:04.439> cover<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:07.159> then<00:01:08.960> next<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
valve cover and then next is this this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
valve cover and then next is this this
tube<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:12.439> which<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:14.549> goes<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.210> combi

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
tube here which it goes to this combi

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
tube here which it goes to this combi
valve<00:01:16.020> I'll<00:01:16.350> show<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.280> second<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
valve I'll show you that in a second it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
valve I'll show you that in a second it
hooks<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.490> port<00:01:20.490> right<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
hooks to that port right there on the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.080 
hooks to that port right there on the
combi<00:01:21.540> valve<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.850> one

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
combi valve and there's a I think one

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.499 
combi valve and there's a I think one
bolt<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:26.030> take<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.240> off

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
bolt on it right in here take that off

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.649 
bolt on it right in here take that off
and<00:01:30.439> then<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> heat<00:01:31.979> shield<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:33.299> sets

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and then there's a heat shield that sets

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.440 
and then there's a heat shield that sets
right<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:35.610> there's<00:01:35.790> four<00:01:35.850> bolts

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
right in here I think there's four bolts

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.630 
right in here I think there's four bolts
that<00:01:36.509> hold<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> off<00:01:37.710> give<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that hold it on take it off give you a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.889 
that hold it on take it off give you a
little<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.150> room<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:42.240> combi<00:01:42.810> bow

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
little bit more room and this combi bow

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.399 
little bit more room and this combi bow
sits<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:48.049> like<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
sits right in here that like that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.870 
sits right in here that like that
there's<00:01:50.399> three<00:01:51.030> Allen<00:01:51.869> bolts<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:53.460> hold<00:01:53.670> it

slide<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> off<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.560> stud<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.400> then<00:02:39.360> there's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
slide it off the stud and then there's

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.290 
slide it off the stud and then there's
enough<00:02:40.320> flex<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:40.980> tube<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.670> kind<00:02:42.270> of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
enough flex in this tube I kind of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.080 
enough flex in this tube I kind of
pushed<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.750> down<00:02:42.980> took<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.130> long<00:02:44.340> wire<00:02:44.700> tie

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
pushed it down took a long wire tie

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.660 
pushed it down took a long wire tie
wrapped<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.870> around<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.290> stud<00:02:47.160> right<00:02:47.400> here

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
wrapped it around this stud right here

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.009 
wrapped it around this stud right here
kind<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.000> hold<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.270> down<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.810> your<00:02:48.959> way<00:02:49.110> and

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
kind of hold it down out of your way and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.090 
kind of hold it down out of your way and

it and then I'll show you after I get

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.000 
it and then I'll show you after I get
this<00:03:04.440> out

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
this out

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.620 
this out
I<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.580> got<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> sitting<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> hole

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
I just got it sitting in the hole

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.160 
I just got it sitting in the hole
there's<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.930> little<00:03:07.700> clip<00:03:09.739> right<00:03:10.739> here<00:03:12.170> that

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
there's a little clip right here that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.699 
there's a little clip right here that
holds<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.590> temp<00:03:13.950> sensor<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:15.500> there's<00:03:16.500> your

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
holds that temp sensor in there's your

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.030 
holds that temp sensor in there's your
temp<00:03:16.950> sensor<00:03:17.340> port<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.390> clip<00:03:18.799> sets<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:19.950> a

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
the back of the engine and it was easier

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.830 
the back of the engine and it was easier
to<00:04:49.410> get<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.919> after<00:04:50.130> I<00:04:50.250> got<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.520> broke<00:04:50.760> loose<00:04:50.910> so

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
to get to after I got it broke loose so

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.210 
to get to after I got it broke loose so
take<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.229> out<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.740> also<00:04:52.889> on<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.400> same<00:04:53.820> tube

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
take that out and also on that same tube

here's the old flange we'll look at it a

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.830 
here's the old flange we'll look at it a
little<00:06:00.060> bit<00:06:00.240> better<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:01.349> mounts<00:06:02.510> mounts<00:06:03.510> like

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
little bit better it mounts mounts like

there's your radiator pipe inlet and I

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.480 
there's your radiator pipe inlet and I
said<00:06:12.960> there's<00:06:13.139> your<00:06:13.260> coolant<00:06:13.590> temp<00:06:14.400> sensor

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
said there's your coolant temp sensor

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.779 
said there's your coolant temp sensor
port<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.470> there's<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.680> heater<00:06:17.130> hose<00:06:17.340> nipple

on the bottom there's the sawed that

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.110 
on the bottom there's the sawed that
that's<00:06:20.310> clip<00:06:20.849> slides<00:06:21.180> into<00:06:21.979> the<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.910> new

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
that's clip slides into the the new

that's clip slides into the the new
flange<00:06:25.039> the<00:06:26.039> o-ring<00:06:26.550> is<00:06:26.760> kind<00:06:27.330> of<00:06:27.389> molded<00:06:27.840> in

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
flange the o-ring is kind of molded in

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.719 
flange the o-ring is kind of molded in
here<00:06:28.320> so<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.710> can't<00:06:28.950> it<00:06:29.130> won't<00:06:29.340> be<00:06:29.490> able<00:06:29.610> to

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
here so it can't it won't be able to

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.940 
here so it can't it won't be able to
distort<00:06:30.419> it<00:06:30.479> again<00:06:30.660> like<00:06:30.840> this<00:06:31.020> old<00:06:31.470> one<00:06:31.710> did

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
distort it again like this old one did

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.219 
distort it again like this old one did
it's<00:06:32.760> kind<00:06:32.970> of<00:06:33.030> molded<00:06:33.360> in<00:06:33.570> so<00:06:33.930> it<00:06:34.050> shouldn't

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
it's kind of molded in so it shouldn't

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:40.490 
it's kind of molded in so it shouldn't
happen<00:06:34.470> again<00:06:34.710> I<00:06:36.320> got<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.960> parts<00:06:40.320> from

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
happen again I got the parts from

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.709 
happen again I got the parts from
Volkswagen<00:06:40.800> O'Reilly<00:06:41.760> offered<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.210> coolant

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
Volkswagen O'Reilly offered the coolant

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.140 
Volkswagen O'Reilly offered the coolant
flange<00:06:43.159> but<00:06:44.159> it<00:06:44.280> didn't<00:06:44.520> come<00:06:44.640> with<00:06:44.669> any<00:06:44.820> of

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
flange but it didn't come with any of

flange but it didn't come with any of
the<00:06:45.210> other<00:06:45.330> o-ring<00:06:45.810> so<00:06:46.080> I<00:06:46.110> actually<00:06:46.830> had<00:06:47.130> to<00:06:47.220> go

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
the other o-ring so I actually had to go

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.270
