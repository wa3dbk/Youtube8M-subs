00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
but we're just gonna analyze a small

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.990 
but we're just gonna analyze a small
portion<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.310> talked<00:02:56.520> about<00:02:56.820> and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
ago now in black ops 1 we have

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.810

shangri-la and moon which have undecided

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.280 
shangri-la and moon which have undecided

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
dates and the 1917 letters may relate to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.260 
dates and the 1917 letters may relate to
those<00:03:10.470> maps<00:03:10.770> in<00:03:11.070> some<00:03:11.340> way<00:03:11.520> even<00:03:11.970> though<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
those maps in some way even though the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.449 
those maps in some way even though the
letters<00:03:12.600> state<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.770> map<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.340> to

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
letters state that the map is going to

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.120 
letters state that the map is going to
be<00:03:14.580> held<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.060> northern<00:03:15.510> France<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.260> still<00:03:16.890> think

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
be held in northern France I still think

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.500 
be held in northern France I still think
the<00:03:17.250> map<00:03:17.430> will<00:03:17.550> take<00:03:17.760> place<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.030> northern

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the map will take place in northern

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.870 
the map will take place in northern
France<00:03:18.840> however<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.370> next

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
France however I think that this next

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.060 
France however I think that this next
DLC<00:03:21.360> will<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.750> some<00:03:21.989> relation<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.590> moon<00:03:22.830> and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
DLC will have some relation to moon and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.070 
DLC will have some relation to moon and
shangri-la<00:03:23.640> basically<00:03:24.510> what<00:03:24.660> I'm<00:03:24.750> trying<00:03:25.019> to

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
shangri-la basically what I'm trying to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.380 
shangri-la basically what I'm trying to
say<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.730> realistically<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.970> terms<00:03:27.269> of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
say is that realistically in terms of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.479 
say is that realistically in terms of
zombies<00:03:27.840> it's<00:03:28.290> odd<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.620> these<00:03:28.980> letters<00:03:29.340> were

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
zombies it's odd that these letters were

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.120 
zombies it's odd that these letters were
written<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.910> 1917<00:03:30.900> even<00:03:31.470> though<00:03:31.590> all<00:03:31.830> other

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
written in 1917 even though all other

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.729 
written in 1917 even though all other

I<00:04:05.580> think<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.090> map<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.959> in<00:04:07.140> France

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
I think of this map if it is in France

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.440 
I think of this map if it is in France
will<00:04:07.800> allow<00:04:08.040> us<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.250> change<00:04:08.640> time<00:04:09.030> periods

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
will allow us to change time periods

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.120 
will allow us to change time periods
because<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.019> dates<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.560> letters<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
because the dates of the letters and the

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.820 
because the dates of the letters and the
dates<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.910> all<00:04:12.180> other<00:04:12.510> zombie<00:04:12.959> maps<00:04:13.200> do<00:04:13.590> not

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
dates of all other zombie maps do not

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.490 
dates of all other zombie maps do not
add<00:04:14.070> up<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:15.120> only<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.959> also<00:04:16.260> believe

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
add up not only that but I also believe

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.530 
add up not only that but I also believe
that<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.250> original<00:04:17.489> zombie<00:04:17.940> crew<00:04:18.299> will<00:04:18.510> be

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
that the original zombie crew will be

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.479 
that the original zombie crew will be
