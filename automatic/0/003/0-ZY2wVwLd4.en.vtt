00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 or the girl that her baby we are here a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 new video first of all say that this 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.719
 top 10 months of me crumbs and leave 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.000
 darios but let's continue after so much 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.730
 sorry time for my delay so much 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.800
 mental as temporary let's do this 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.850
 top 10 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.189
 based on my opinion with the help of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.050
 many people from the forum of little expert 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.580
 and especially a person who is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 descriptions and that many thanks 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 so let's start in the middle of 10 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.929
 we have our click to zero to don 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 Pokemon pretty ugly my opinion but 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.640
 perfect for the competitive one that with its 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.370
 joker skills a good set and their 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 includes stacks do not do much damage without 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 forget that you only have two weaknesses 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 earth and fire let's be the keychain 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.930
 tocacojones and we go with the number 9 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.880
 in this position we have a flower and a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.310
 little of type a gives equal to the previous one 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.650
 great pokemon best flower I keep thinking 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.690
 that lacks type fairy time plant 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.450
 sorry but let's continue it's a little 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.210
 incredibly defensive special but 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.400
 my precious 6 flip keeps on being with him 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 I keep saying that this common so 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.369
 defensive goes from fucking mother 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.760
 colloquially speaking but 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.550
 for p to competitively 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.170
 competitive forgive a good toxic 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.450
 protection and a couple of attacks of type 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 wing in case the flies as spaces 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.610
 rare and the opposite is very fast is very 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.070
 let 's move fast might sting given type 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.700
 to your true weakness in this case the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.340
 number 8 may dragon type I repeat is a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 little really used the competitive by 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.050
 your tall ones are clearly highlighting 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.660
 defensively rather special flaw 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.690
 although I could continue to hurt is the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.430
 Baba consolidation attack can lower 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.920
 the speed using this as a benefit 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.160
 It's not that powerful but I recommend it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.470
 so much you can use it so much 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.810
 offensively as defensively what 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.490
 I leave to your choice we are getting closer 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.030
 to the top 5 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.680
 number seven how fight a bit a 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.470
 flying a little bit misunderstood by 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.720
 that firefighter and with good attack but as 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.670
 everything has disadvantages has several 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.849
 weaknesses although being fast what 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.980
 you can see her beautifully with her 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.260
 various skills of mus gives many 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.800
 possibilities without a little character is a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.680
 little enough to say very very very 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.310
 difficult to use look for combinations like 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.500
 Acrobat plus the ability to fight can 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.860
 burst the opponent let's go back to the guy 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.630
 dragon with the number 6 in this position 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.220
 we have one of my movements 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.830
 of this generation in terms of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.840
 Appearance of the agave a pokémon that 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.390
 now you can not make much of it anymore 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.180
 that his weakness to earth fucks a lot 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.489
 people but when you can start 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.590
 get with the hidden life all the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.350
 world is going to see pink ponies is going to be a 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.250
 little incredibly strong entering 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.400
 the number 5 therefore in the top 5 I am 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.280
 pretty asshole we have 3 edges a 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.790
 pokémon of so to speak 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.830
 being the first one that can depend on the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.500
 size your stats relax from that 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.290
 can depend on the size and change their 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.180
 stocks people do not know how to do not 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.120
 he knows what to do with him he can be a 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.670
 little sprinter can tell us if a 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.920
 strange big pokemon based on the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.780
 special attack could extract the number 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.530
 4 if it were not for your abilities by 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.300
 your fucking skills 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.180
 I repeat with what colloquially 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.750
 talking about his departure is completely 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.060
 fucking with the number 4 approaching us 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.730
 the 3 to the 3 best we could of this 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.190
 sixth generation in sample in the is with 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.319
 pokemon of normal electric type still 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.050
 limping with his thinking thanks to his 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.709
 ability and the dry can do a lot 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.080
 damage thanks to the weather changing it 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.170
 combining forgiveness with more burden remains 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.170
 for ball we can recover almost all the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.950
 life in one really incredible tone 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.370
 almost 85 percent is pretty good 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.530
 almost everything and finally arrived good what 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.840
 you were waiting we entered the top 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.109
 3 and in the last position of this 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.250
 this top but the third of the best 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.780
 we have glass a pokémon 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.479
 incredibly powerful bestial impeccable 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.550
 safely tactical change can 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.070
 get to destroy any 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.320
 anyone using egg and a good one 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.140
 sword dance is a bit with really 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.889
 Amazing spectacular though tactics 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.740
 for this why 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.590
 to give and give we got to the point 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.169
 critic who is going to give me more talk 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.409
 you are going to insult me you are going to cost is not 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.629
 this cyberbullying you will complain 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.879
 I will comment jce I shit on God but let's go 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.400
 there I will say it with number two 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.349
 we have to flame this and you are 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.889
 saying heel end like heel flame 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.279
 in front well that is in number one 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.629
 like bears but usually explain you think 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.759
 which is the best of this generation but 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.889
 let's analyze it let's start with your 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.000
 bestial speed many people are to see 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.400
 that we can type them as a workshop 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.810
 tend to be fast but this little 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.699
 where it stands out incredibly in 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.949
 speed making the opponent fall as if 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.360
 outside a pen we can not forget its 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.460
 hidden ability that allows us to use 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.979
 acrobat or respite by priority 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.590
 really credible but here it comes in its 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.659
 big flaw if you use I recommend no 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.969
 use it against with this rock type since 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.529
 his great weakness for four this is what 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.289
 that game of enough and its attack is 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:39.020
 It is high but there are few with much more 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.370
 attack but I find it with quite 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.230
 good in the psuv 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.030
 his hidden ability is 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.430
 very good for competitive here we enter 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.160
 already with the number one we finally arrived 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.530
 you are tired of me but finally 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.800
 we reached number one and this 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.190
 I 'm going to give it to believe ninja no 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.890
 like balls an initial pokémon 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.390
 Sinister water can be in the number 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.700
 one of the best we can in sixth 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.860
 generation and it 's price we're going to 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.500
 explain forgiveness who would say that one of 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.620
 the sixth generation initials as 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.570
 I said before it could be the best of 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.580
 this generation stands out in having 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.710
 explain highlights in attack speed and 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.050
 Special attack What else can you ask for? 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.750
 of a pokémon explain it to me then you can 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.340
 ask even more for his hidden skill 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.830
 the hidden in muta type that change from 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.140
 kind almost in that you can get change 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.610
 of type in each movement or almost every 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:42.120
 move if you do not use the same type 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:45.300
 an oil with life conceals its states 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.699
 a good set and a little practice and 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.400
 experience could destroy many 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.669
 many many competitive pokémons 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.569
 with this he finished this top 10 I hope that you 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:00.629
 I liked it, it was quite long but 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:03.539
 kids I hope to remember this is just my 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:06.659
 opinion I hope you do not do me 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:09.060
 cyberbulling and pokemon tactics 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:13.520
 nolasco feet imagine the and 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.520
 reinvent them in until later
