going to see why and I plus I even got
it<00:00:39.780> connected<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.410> wireless<00:00:40.980> adapter

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
it connected to this wireless adapter

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.139 
it connected to this wireless adapter
this<00:00:43.440> old<00:00:43.680> wireless<00:00:44.160> router<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.850> 2003

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
this old wireless router from like 2003

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.040 
this old wireless router from like 2003
and<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.829> down<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.930> with
