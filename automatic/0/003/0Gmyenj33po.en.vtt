worth just putting the dryer on just to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.750 
worth just putting the dryer on just to
get<00:00:33.450> those<00:00:34.380> first<00:00:34.680> few<00:00:34.829> hectares<00:00:35.190> opened<00:00:35.640> up

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
get those first few hectares opened up

get those first few hectares opened up
and<00:00:35.969> under<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> belt<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> variety

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and under the belt this is a variety

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
and under the belt this is a variety
called<00:00:38.190> kws<00:00:38.969> Trinity<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> milling<00:00:40.079> wheat

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
called kws Trinity it's a milling wheat

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.010 
called kws Trinity it's a milling wheat
variety<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.860> we're<00:00:40.980> growing<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.550> seed

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
variety and we're growing this for seed

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
variety and we're growing this for seed
no<00:00:43.020> idea<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.379> yield<00:00:43.770> yet<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> first

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
no idea on yield yet it's the first

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.220 
no idea on yield yet it's the first
field<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> we've<00:00:45.059> cut<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.629> very<00:00:45.899> very

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
field that we've cut it on very very

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.069 
field that we've cut it on very very
like<00:00:46.469> sandy<00:00:46.890> land<00:00:47.300> plant<00:00:48.300> population<00:00:48.899> looks

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
like sandy land plant population looks

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
like sandy land plant population looks
pretty<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.700> thick<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.180> would

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
pretty good it's not as thick as I would

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
pretty good it's not as thick as I would
have<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:51.809> heavy<00:00:52.350> land<00:00:52.620> fields<00:00:53.100> but

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
have it for our heavy land fields but

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.439 
have it for our heavy land fields but
that's<00:00:53.370> usually<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:53.730> moisture<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that's usually because moisture is a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.170 
that's usually because moisture is a
limiting<00:00:54.840> factor<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> ground<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.640> we

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
limiting factor on this ground so we

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
limiting factor on this ground so we
don't<00:00:57.360> want<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.960> pick<00:00:58.320> apart<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.980> Eliza<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
don't want to pick apart and Eliza just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.609 
don't want to pick apart and Eliza just
end<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.910> fighting<00:01:00.410> for<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> moisture<00:01:03.619> whinger

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
end up fighting for the moisture whinger

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.140 
end up fighting for the moisture whinger
which<00:01:04.860> obviously<00:01:05.100> anymore<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.850> something

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
which obviously anymore to do something

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.200 
which obviously anymore to do something
here<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> other<00:01:08.430> crops<00:01:08.670> we've<00:01:08.880> cut<00:01:09.030> today

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210

here so the other crops we've cut today
we've<00:01:09.570> cut<00:01:09.750> some<00:01:09.960> gallon<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.439> second<00:01:10.860> week

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
we've cut some gallon to second week

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.580 
we've cut some gallon to second week
that's<00:01:12.119> yielded<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.229> very

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that's yielded really really well very

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.050 
that's yielded really really well very
pleased<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.340> was<00:01:14.430> clean<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.850> year

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
even those later plantings when we're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270 
even those later plantings when we're
trying<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.110> delay<00:01:25.350> drilling<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.860> blackgrass

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
trying to delay drilling for blackgrass

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.610 
trying to delay drilling for blackgrass
reasons<00:01:27.829> black<00:01:28.829> ass<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.369> cheated<00:01:30.590> off

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
later drilling in the right year can

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.400 
later drilling in the right year can
deliver<00:01:41.740> significant<00:01:42.490> yield<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.080> got<00:01:44.200> rock

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410
