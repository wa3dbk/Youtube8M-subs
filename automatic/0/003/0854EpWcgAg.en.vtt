00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.870
 Modern general anesthesia looks like 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.650
 fly a modern airplane the standards of 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.500
 quality are very high the possibility of 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.410
 that a complication arises is minimal 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.380
 then security security is a 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.900
 everything as when one of the youngest child 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.150
 they would draw a big ball and 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.220
 some little balls inside then 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.850
 let's talk about the big ball is that 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.010
 safety where the patient is my 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.500
 main objective and where the security 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.110
 of my patient is that great circle 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 what are the little circles the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.350
 anesthesiologist exams 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.479
 preoperative and a responsible surgeon 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 then the safety of anesthesia 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.790
 modern is given since the surgeon 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.620
 do not do more than what you have to do 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.870
 operate in an appropriate place where if the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.729
 surgeon is a crazy surgeon the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.979
 anesthesiologist stops him and tells him to hear 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.780
 you can not do all this that is 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.960
 wanting to make him do his patient 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.700
 let's do this right now or let's 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.409
 do these two procedures right now and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.869
 then we can do the others 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.759
 when it is operating with the professionalism 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.450
 Modern general anesthesia is a 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.850
 extremely safe procedure the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.189
 possibility of statistics that exists 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.229
 an anesthetic accident in a patient 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.299
 of low operative risk like all 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.369
 patients that we operate in surgery 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.630
 plastic is four in ten thousand me 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.250
 I invite you to take one 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.189
 calculator and divide in four between 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.270
 10,000 is a number with many 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.599
 many zeros before there is a 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.939
 digit 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:53.799
 then the modern general anesthesia is 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.799
 a highly secure procedure
