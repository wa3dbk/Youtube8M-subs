the<00:02:51.140> nose<00:02:51.379> so<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.159> makes<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.430> stand<00:02:52.549> out<00:02:52.760> a

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
the nose so it makes it stand out a

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.100 
the nose so it makes it stand out a
little<00:02:52.940> bit<00:02:53.060> more<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.540> could<00:02:53.659> see<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.930> so

little bit more so you could see it so

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.380 
little bit more so you could see it so
it<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.530> doesn't<00:02:55.099> look<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.700> mask<00:02:55.970> and

like<00:03:20.060> after<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:20.569> this

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.050 

I<00:03:25.470> should<00:03:26.470> mention<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.069> made<00:03:27.100> my<00:03:27.460> ears<00:03:27.700> out<00:03:27.910> of

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
I should mention I made my ears out of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.000 
I should mention I made my ears out of
construction<00:03:28.690> paper<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.319> glued<00:03:29.560> them<00:03:29.770> onto

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
construction paper and I glued them onto

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.370 
construction paper and I glued them onto
a<00:03:30.190> headband<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.240> painted<00:03:31.630> them<00:03:31.780> using<00:03:32.230> my

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
a headband and I painted them using my

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.520 
a headband and I painted them using my
face<00:03:32.620> paints<00:03:33.130> after<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:33.910> got<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.930> ears<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.350> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
face paints after I got the ears on and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.290 
face paints after I got the ears on and
I<00:03:35.590> painted<00:03:35.950> them<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.490> bit<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:36.819> went<00:03:37.240> ahead

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
I painted them a little bit I went ahead

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.780 
I painted them a little bit I went ahead
and<00:03:37.480> used<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.930> black<00:03:38.290> eye<00:03:38.560> shadow<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:39.490> shade

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
and used a black eye shadow to shade

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.760 
and used a black eye shadow to shade
around<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.150> eyes<00:03:40.300> just<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.990> little<00:03:41.350> bit<00:03:41.530> so

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
around the eyes just a little bit so

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.460 
around the eyes just a little bit so
this<00:03:41.920> adds<00:03:42.190> more<00:03:42.340> dimension<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.020> eyes<00:03:44.140> and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
this adds more dimension to the eyes and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.380 
this adds more dimension to the eyes and
then<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.100> used<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.459> black<00:03:45.670> eye<00:03:45.880> shadow<00:03:45.910> to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
then I used the black eye shadow to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.300 
then I used the black eye shadow to
shade<00:03:46.630> around<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.140> mask<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.740> makes<00:03:47.920> certain

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
shade around the mask it makes certain

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.510 
shade around the mask it makes certain
areas<00:03:48.760> darker<00:03:49.360> especially<00:03:50.170> around<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.040> edges

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
areas darker especially around the edges

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.270 
areas darker especially around the edges
of<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.880> mask

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.340 

you<00:03:58.880> want<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.180> use<00:03:59.330> eye<00:03:59.569> shadows<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.319> create

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350

you want to use eye shadows to create
fur<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.280> want<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.459> use<00:04:01.580> eye<00:04:01.670> shadows

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
on the cheekbones and I use a medium

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.060 
on the cheekbones and I use a medium
blue<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.540> do<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.049> then<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:21.200> use<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.560> lighter

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
blue to do that and then I use a lighter

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.030 
blue to do that and then I use a lighter
blue<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:23.210> highlight<00:04:23.840> around<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.530> fur<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:24.889> that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
blue to highlight around the fur so that

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.100 
blue to highlight around the fur so that
it<00:04:25.130> really<00:04:25.250> pops<00:04:25.550> out<00:04:25.700> into<00:04:26.090> highlight<00:04:26.570> right

where my like the nose meets the mouth

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.060 
where my like the nose meets the mouth
