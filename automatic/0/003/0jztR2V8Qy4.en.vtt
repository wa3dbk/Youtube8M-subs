00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hi today I have an air conditioner

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.769 
hi today I have an air conditioner
problem<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.259> I'm<00:00:04.410> gonna<00:00:04.589> troubleshoot<00:00:05.370> and

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
problem that I'm gonna troubleshoot and

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.120 
problem that I'm gonna troubleshoot and
just<00:00:06.779> walk<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.259> through<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> process<00:00:07.589> of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
just walk you through the process of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.270 
just walk you through the process of
what<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.400> figured<00:00:08.519> out<00:00:09.170> and<00:00:10.170> how<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> figured<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
what I figured out and how I figured it

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.140 
what I figured out and how I figured it
out

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
out

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.939 
out
so<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.380> off<00:00:13.559> let<00:00:13.740> me<00:00:13.769> describe<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.400> problem

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.840 

when<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> go<00:00:20.130> ahead<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> car<00:00:20.880> up

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
when I go ahead and start the car up

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.750 
when I go ahead and start the car up
make<00:00:23.850> sure<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> air<00:00:24.330> conditioner<00:00:25.580> button<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
make sure the air conditioner button is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.669 
make sure the air conditioner button is
on<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:28.500> get<00:00:28.740> nothing<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:30.470> temperature<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
on and I get nothing the temperature of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.979 
on and I get nothing the temperature of
the<00:00:31.830> air<00:00:31.859> doesn't<00:00:32.460> change<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.090> no<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.809> is

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the air doesn't change at all no this is

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.450 
the air doesn't change at all no this is
important<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.340> cold<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
important if it's just not as cold I

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.440 
important if it's just not as cold I
would<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.579> known<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> different

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
would have known that it's a different

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.670 
would have known that it's a different
problem<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:39.960> working<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
problem but it's not working at all and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.520 
problem but it's not working at all and
that<00:00:43.680> makes<00:00:44.100> me<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.530> compressor

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that makes me think that the compressor

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
that makes me think that the compressor
which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> critical<00:00:48.270> components

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
which is one of the critical components

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.850 
which is one of the critical components
of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> a/c<00:00:49.680> system<00:00:49.710> isn't<00:00:50.340> working<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:51.860> well

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
of the a/c system isn't working for well

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.290 
of the a/c system isn't working for well
at<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.190> there's<00:00:53.399> something<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.090> wrong

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
at all there's something really wrong

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.400 
at all there's something really wrong
with<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
with it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
with it
because<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.610> were<00:00:56.760> getting<00:00:56.879> any<00:00:57.149> kind<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
because if I were getting any kind of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.479 
because if I were getting any kind of
cold<00:00:57.809> air<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> sign<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.219> it's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
cold air would be a sign that it's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
cold air would be a sign that it's
working<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.090> maybe<00:01:00.300> not<00:01:00.510> properly<00:01:01.020> charged

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
working but maybe not properly charged

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
working but maybe not properly charged
or<00:01:01.559> something<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.149> but<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.300> not

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
or something like that but it's not

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.410 
or something like that but it's not
working<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:03.989> all<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.700> clue

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
working at all so that was my first clue

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230 
working at all so that was my first clue
I'm<00:01:06.659> gonna<00:01:06.930> run<00:01:07.260> back<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.979> check<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> a/c

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
I'm gonna run back and check the a/c

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.649 
I'm gonna run back and check the a/c
compressor<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:11.010> figure<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.580> what's<00:01:12.420> wrong

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
compressor to figure out what's wrong

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.170 
compressor to figure out what's wrong
with<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
with it

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.620 
with it
so<00:01:15.890> that's<00:01:16.890> where<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> went<00:01:17.490> first<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.360> let<00:01:18.600> me

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so that's where I went first so let me

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.940 
so that's where I went first so let me
take<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> around<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.439> side<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> I'll

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
take you around the other side and I'll

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.860 
take you around the other side and I'll
show<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.869> what<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.080> looking<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.850> now

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
show you what I was looking at now

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.730 
show you what I was looking at now
the<00:01:25.730> AC<00:01:26.730> compressor<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.870> always<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.440> front

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the AC compressor is always in the front

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
the AC compressor is always in the front
of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> engine<00:01:29.510> it's<00:01:30.510> connected<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
of the engine it's connected to one of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
of the engine it's connected to one of
the<00:01:31.560> belts<00:01:31.950> usually<00:01:32.370> there's<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.640> separate

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the belts usually there's a separate

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
the belts usually there's a separate
smaller<00:01:33.660> belt<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.290> front<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.830> running

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
smaller belt in the front that's running

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.720 
smaller belt in the front that's running
the<00:01:35.430> AC<00:01:35.760> compressor<00:01:37.160> it'll<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> AC

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
the AC compressor it'll have the AC

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.120 
the AC compressor it'll have the AC
lines<00:01:39.300> or<00:01:39.600> hoses<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.980> you'll

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
lines or hoses going to it so you'll

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
lines or hoses going to it so you'll
know<00:01:41.370> that<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:42.030> compressor<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.020> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
know that it's the compressor so you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.860 
know that it's the compressor so you
just<00:01:43.650> gotta<00:01:43.830> look<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.370> and<00:01:44.550> find<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.140> on<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
just gotta look at and find it on the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.440 
just gotta look at and find it on the
e36<00:01:48.870> bmw<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.820> below<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
e36 bmw it's right here right below the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.080 
e36 bmw it's right here right below the
coolant<00:01:52.020> expansion<00:01:52.650> check<00:01:52.920> tank<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.970> I'm

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
coolant expansion check tank so I'm

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.000 
coolant expansion check tank so I'm
gonna<00:01:54.240> give<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> shot<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.770> down

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
gonna give you a shot of that right down

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.030 
gonna give you a shot of that right down
here<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.510> can<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> compressor<00:01:58.800> right

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
here so you can see the compressor right

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.570 
here so you can see the compressor right
there<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.990> you'll<00:02:00.990> notice<00:02:01.230> at<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.130> end

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
there and you'll notice at the very end

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.410 
there and you'll notice at the very end
of<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:05.120> right<00:02:06.120> on<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:07.530> side<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:09.060> front

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
of it right on on that side the front

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.110 
of it right on on that side the front
elements<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.260> rotating<00:02:10.980> now

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
elements not rotating now

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.160 
elements not rotating now
when<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.870> AC<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.130> should<00:02:14.430> rotate

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
when the AC is on that should rotate

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
when the AC is on that should rotate
part<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> time<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:16.800> shut<00:02:17.070> off<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.610> then

part of the time then shut off and then

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.100 
part of the time then shut off and then
rotate<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.780> more<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.230> then<00:02:20.070> shut<00:02:20.370> off<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
rotate some more and then shut off it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.200 
rotate some more and then shut off it
won't<00:02:22.410> rotate<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.970> should

won't rotate all the time but it should

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.710 
won't rotate all the time but it should
switch<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.970> you'll<00:02:26.970> notice<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.450> watch

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
switch on and you'll notice I can watch

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.680 
switch on and you'll notice I can watch
it<00:02:27.750> watch<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.470> watch<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.510> just

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it watch it watch it and it's it's just

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.250 
it watch it watch it and it's it's just
never<00:02:31.200> never<00:02:32.160> rotating<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.750> kind<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.110> get

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
never never rotating you can kind of get

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.800 
never never rotating you can kind of get
a<00:02:34.290> better<00:02:34.530> look<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.340> go<00:02:35.610> round<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
a better look at it if you go round the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.340 
a better look at it if you go round the
expansion<00:02:37.350> tank<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:39.989> straight

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
expansion tank here and look straight

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.720 
expansion tank here and look straight
down<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.209> again<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.160> see<00:02:44.430> again

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
down there it is again you can see again

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.520 
down there it is again you can see again
that<00:02:45.030> front<00:02:45.900> element<00:02:46.380> isn't<00:02:46.590> rotating<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
that front element isn't rotating and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.940 
that front element isn't rotating and
that's<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.800> sign<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.700> clutch<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.950> either

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
that's a sign that the clutch is either

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's a sign that the clutch is either
bad<00:02:53.430> or<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:53.970> not<00:02:54.150> engaging<00:02:54.600> now<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.800> can

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
bad or it's not engaging now that I can

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.120 
bad or it's not engaging now that I can
see<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.640> clutch<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.739> end<00:02:58.860> is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
see that the clutch here on the end is

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.440 
see that the clutch here on the end is
in<00:02:59.730> fact<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.239> engaging<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.300> that's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
in fact not engaging I know that that's

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.590 
in fact not engaging I know that that's
the<00:03:03.840> problem<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.940> condenser

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the problem I know that the condenser

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600 
the problem I know that the condenser
clutch<00:03:07.050> is<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.650> engaging<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
clutch is just not engaging so the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.570 
clutch is just not engaging so the
condensers<00:03:09.209> not<00:03:09.510> turning<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.200> now<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
condensers not turning on now I have to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.630 
condensers not turning on now I have to
figure<00:03:12.060> out<00:03:12.330> whether<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.840> clutch<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.530> bad<00:03:13.830> or

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
figure out whether the clutch is bad or

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.170 
figure out whether the clutch is bad or
whether<00:03:15.120> there's<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.630> problem<00:03:16.260> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.620> power

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
whether there's a problem with the power

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
whether there's a problem with the power
going<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.660> clutch<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:20.519> right<00:03:20.760> here

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
going to the clutch so right here

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.720 
going to the clutch so right here
there's<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.390> plug<00:03:22.070> that<00:03:23.070> I'm<00:03:23.340> gonna<00:03:23.519> go<00:03:23.670> ahead

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
there's a plug that I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.850 
there's a plug that I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:23.820> disconnect<00:03:24.860> there<00:03:25.860> we<00:03:26.010> go

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
and disconnect there we go

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.350 
and disconnect there we go
now<00:03:28.570> these<00:03:29.570> plugs<00:03:29.990> will<00:03:30.230> either<00:03:30.400> have<00:03:31.400> two

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
now these plugs will either have two

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.470 
now these plugs will either have two
wires<00:03:32.660> going<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.470> them<00:03:33.590> in<00:03:34.460> which<00:03:34.730> case<00:03:34.820> one<00:03:35.300> is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
wires going to them in which case one is

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.930 
wires going to them in which case one is
a<00:03:35.510> live<00:03:35.810> wire<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.320> one's<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.620> ground<00:03:36.860> or<00:03:37.310> quite

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
a live wire and one's a ground or quite

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.850 
a live wire and one's a ground or quite
commonly<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.750> this<00:03:38.930> one<00:03:39.170> they'll<00:03:39.380> only<00:03:39.560> have

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
commonly like this one they'll only have

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.990 
commonly like this one they'll only have
one<00:03:40.250> live<00:03:40.550> wire<00:03:40.880> going<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.540> them<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.400> case

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
one live wire going to them in that case

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.810 
one live wire going to them in that case
this<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.110> hot<00:03:45.320> wire<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.920> then<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.760> should

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
this is the hot wire and then you should

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.140 
this is the hot wire and then you should
ground<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.620> metal<00:03:49.250> part<00:03:49.610> in<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.850> frame

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
ground it to a metal part in the frame

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.070 
ground it to a metal part in the frame
so<00:03:51.340> I'm<00:03:52.340> gonna<00:03:52.640> check<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.120> make<00:03:53.540> sure<00:03:53.840> that

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
so I'm gonna check and make sure that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.260 
so I'm gonna check and make sure that
this<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.470> getting<00:03:54.860> power<00:03:55.130> because<00:03:55.940> if<00:03:56.120> it's

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
this is getting power because if it's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.450 
this is getting power because if it's
not<00:03:56.360> getting<00:03:56.840> power<00:03:57.050> then<00:03:57.590> my<00:03:57.800> clutch<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.250> fine

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
not getting power then my clutch is fine

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.850 
not getting power then my clutch is fine
and<00:03:58.640> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.060> problem<00:03:59.510> so<00:04:00.230> I'm<00:04:00.350> taking<00:04:00.560> an

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
and this is the problem so I'm taking an

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.000 
and this is the problem so I'm taking an
ammeter<00:04:01.130> here<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.000> I'm<00:04:02.630> putting<00:04:03.050> on<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.800> one

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
ammeter here and I'm putting on the one

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.070 
ammeter here and I'm putting on the one
wire<00:04:04.280> I'm<00:04:04.550> putting<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.230> hot<00:04:06.230> wire<00:04:06.410> here<00:04:06.980> and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
wire I'm putting the hot wire here and

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.070 
wire I'm putting the hot wire here and
then<00:04:09.700> for<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.790> other<00:04:10.820> one<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.870> rounding

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
then for the other one I'm just rounding

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.850 
then for the other one I'm just rounding
it<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.240> piece<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.080> metal<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.620> the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
it to the to a piece of metal on the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.479 
it to the to a piece of metal on the
frame<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.930> I'm<00:04:17.930> checking<00:04:18.350> I'm<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.310> gonna

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
frame and I'm checking I'm just gonna

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.770 
frame and I'm checking I'm just gonna
hold<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.060> there<00:04:20.299> for<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.600> while

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
hold it there for a while

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.380 
hold it there for a while
since<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.830> clutch<00:04:22.070> isn't<00:04:22.550> engaged<00:04:23.000> all<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
since the clutch isn't engaged all the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.300 
since the clutch isn't engaged all the
time<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.700> won't<00:04:26.000> necessarily<00:04:26.270> get<00:04:27.170> power<00:04:27.470> but

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
time it won't necessarily get power but

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.600 
time it won't necessarily get power but
if<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.610> wait<00:04:28.820> for<00:04:29.710> 1520<00:04:30.710> seconds<00:04:33.550> right<00:04:34.550> here

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
if I wait for 1520 seconds right here

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.610 
if I wait for 1520 seconds right here
and<00:04:35.150> I'm<00:04:35.270> looking<00:04:35.540> at<00:04:35.660> my<00:04:35.690> ammeter<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.440> whole

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
and I'm looking at my ammeter the whole

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
and I'm looking at my ammeter the whole
time<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:38.720> never<00:04:39.350> get<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.650> 12<00:04:40.040> volt<00:04:40.370> source

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
time and I never get a 12 volt source

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.870 
time and I never get a 12 volt source
from<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.390> wire<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:42.410> means<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.430> there's<00:04:43.640> no

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
from this wire it means that there's no

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.950 
from this wire it means that there's no
power<00:04:44.240> going<00:04:44.720> here<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.550> that's<00:04:47.450> exactly

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
power going here so that's exactly

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.560 
power going here so that's exactly
what's<00:04:48.380> happening<00:04:48.950> I'm<00:04:49.160> watching<00:04:49.640> it<00:04:49.790> and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.440 

it's<00:04:53.570> showing<00:04:54.280> it's<00:04:55.280> never<00:04:55.520> showing<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.150> 12

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
it's showing it's never showing a 12

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.110 
it's showing it's never showing a 12
volt<00:04:56.690> signal<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:58.190> at<00:04:58.310> this<00:04:58.430> point<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.850> know<00:04:59.000> that

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
volt signal so at this point I know that

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.430 
volt signal so at this point I know that
the<00:04:59.570> it<00:05:00.140> is<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.510> condenser<00:05:02.510> clutch<00:05:02.780> the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
the it is the condenser clutch the

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.200 
the it is the condenser clutch the
condenser<00:05:03.950> clutch<00:05:04.160> is<00:05:04.370> probably<00:05:04.880> fine<00:05:05.180> but

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
condenser clutch is probably fine but

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.570 
condenser clutch is probably fine but
it's<00:05:05.570> not<00:05:05.660> getting<00:05:06.020> power<00:05:06.410> I'm<00:05:07.250> gonna<00:05:07.400> go

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
it's not getting power I'm gonna go

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.909 
it's not getting power I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:07.730> and<00:05:08.090> trace<00:05:08.540> back<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.290> source<00:05:09.440> of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
ahead and trace back to the source of

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.850 
ahead and trace back to the source of
this<00:05:10.040> wire<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:11.030> find<00:05:11.330> out<00:05:11.570> which<00:05:11.900> component<00:05:12.680> is

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
this wire to find out which component is

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.450 
this wire to find out which component is
is<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:14.300> problem<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.260> not<00:05:15.500> providing<00:05:16.070> power<00:05:16.280> to

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
is a problem and not providing power to

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.240 
is a problem and not providing power to
the<00:05:16.700> bunch

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.870 

at<00:05:20.250> this<00:05:20.550> point<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:22.130> went<00:05:23.130> ahead<00:05:23.220> and<00:05:23.550> looked<00:05:23.670> at

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
at this point I went ahead and looked at

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.010 
at this point I went ahead and looked at
a<00:05:23.970> wiring<00:05:24.240> diagram<00:05:24.930> for<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.290> AC<00:05:25.440> system<00:05:26.360> oh<00:05:27.360> go

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
a wiring diagram for the AC system oh go

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.700 
a wiring diagram for the AC system oh go
ahead<00:05:28.170> and<00:05:28.290> post<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.830> wiring<00:05:29.520> diagram<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.710> my

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
ahead and post that wiring diagram on my

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.950 
ahead and post that wiring diagram on my
blog<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:32.850> you<00:05:33.120> can<00:05:33.270> take<00:05:33.420> a<00:05:33.450> look<00:05:33.660> at<00:05:33.840> it

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
blog so that you can take a look at it

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.350 
blog so that you can take a look at it
if<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.110> have<00:05:34.230> a<00:05:34.350> similar<00:05:34.740> problem<00:05:35.330> anyway<00:05:36.330> I

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
if you have a similar problem anyway I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.170 
if you have a similar problem anyway I
found<00:05:36.600> out<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.140> first<00:05:37.320> component<00:05:38.180> that

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
found out that the first component that

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.910 
found out that the first component that
connects<00:05:39.930> from<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:40.590> wire<00:05:41.060> is<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.450> relay<00:05:42.920> so

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
connects from that wire is the relay so

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.470 
connects from that wire is the relay so
I<00:05:43.950> figured<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.550> would<00:05:44.580> go<00:05:44.850> ahead<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.270> check

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
I figured I would go ahead and check

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.930 
I figured I would go ahead and check
that<00:05:45.750> relay<00:05:46.310> I'm<00:05:47.310> going<00:05:47.700> here<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:49.370> also<00:05:50.370> on

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
that relay I'm going here and also on

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.210 
that relay I'm going here and also on
the<00:05:51.630> back<00:05:51.870> here<00:05:52.200> you'll<00:05:52.350> notice<00:05:52.560> that<00:05:52.680> all<00:05:52.980> the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
the back here you'll notice that all the

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.060 
the back here you'll notice that all the
positions<00:05:53.670> of<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:53.910> fuses<00:05:54.420> are<00:05:54.570> listed<00:05:55.070> but

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
positions of the fuses are listed but

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.340 
positions of the fuses are listed but
the<00:05:56.280> positions<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.030> relays<00:05:57.450> aren't<00:05:58.080> or

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
the positions of the relays aren't or

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.220 
the positions of the relays aren't or
the<00:05:58.500> which<00:05:59.130> relays<00:05:59.550> are<00:05:59.760> which<00:05:59.940> so<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.810> had<00:06:01.110> to

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
the which relays are which so I had to

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.110 
the which relays are which so I had to
look<00:06:01.380> that<00:06:01.440> up<00:06:01.650> I'll<00:06:01.980> put<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:02.340> on<00:06:02.400> my<00:06:02.580> blog<00:06:02.820> as

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
look that up I'll put that on my blog as

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.340 
look that up I'll put that on my blog as
well<00:06:03.830> but<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.010> relay<00:06:05.400> for<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:06.120> AC<00:06:06.720> compressor

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
well but the relay for the AC compressor

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.340 
well but the relay for the AC compressor
clutch<00:06:07.620> is<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:09.150> guy<00:06:09.390> right<00:06:09.660> here<00:06:09.720> marked

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
clutch is this guy right here marked

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.210 
clutch is this guy right here marked
with<00:06:10.500> 0<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:10.830> 8<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.490> yellow<00:06:12.290> and<00:06:13.290> you'll

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
with 0 to 8 it's yellow and you'll

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.330 
with 0 to 8 it's yellow and you'll
notice<00:06:14.430> that<00:06:14.520> right<00:06:14.850> next<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:15.360> is<00:06:15.600> the

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
notice that right next to it is the

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.390 
notice that right next to it is the
second<00:06:17.340> relay<00:06:17.900> that's<00:06:18.900> identical<00:06:19.410> this<00:06:20.190> one

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
second relay that's identical this one

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.530 
second relay that's identical this one
actually<00:06:20.760> controls<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:21.270> low<00:06:21.540> speed<00:06:21.840> fan<00:06:23.510> so<00:06:24.510> I

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
actually controls the low speed fan so I

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.300 
actually controls the low speed fan so I
figured<00:06:25.160> for<00:06:26.160> an<00:06:26.250> experiment<00:06:26.790> it<00:06:27.060> was<00:06:27.540> safe

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
figured for an experiment it was safe

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:35.740 
figured for an experiment it was safe
just<00:06:29.310> swap<00:06:29.610> these<00:06:29.880> out<00:06:31.220> like<00:06:32.220> that

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.500 

and<00:06:36.820> test<00:06:37.820> it<00:06:38.030> again<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:38.570> what<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:39.590> did<00:06:39.890> that

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
and test it again and what I did that

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.070 
and test it again and what I did that
went<00:06:41.510> back<00:06:41.690> around<00:06:41.900> and<00:06:42.320> sure<00:06:43.250> enough<00:06:44.080> tried

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
went back around and sure enough tried

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.870 
went back around and sure enough tried
it<00:06:45.200> again<00:06:45.470> and<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:48.650> clutch<00:06:48.950> engaged<00:06:49.550> like

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
it again and the the clutch engaged like

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.840 
it again and the the clutch engaged like
it<00:06:50.060> was<00:06:50.210> supposed<00:06:50.570> to<00:06:51.100> so<00:06:52.100> at<00:06:52.220> that<00:06:52.430> point<00:06:52.640> I

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
it was supposed to so at that point I

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.850 
it was supposed to so at that point I
knew<00:06:52.880> a<00:06:53.360> hundred<00:06:53.780> percent<00:06:54.140> that<00:06:54.290> I<00:06:54.440> had<00:06:54.680> to

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
knew a hundred percent that I had to

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.030 
knew a hundred percent that I had to
replace<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:56.150> relay<00:06:56.570> now<00:06:57.470> if<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.740> relay

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
replace the relay now if the relay

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.490 
replace the relay now if the relay
didn't<00:06:58.310> work<00:06:58.550> I'd<00:06:58.790> keep<00:06:59.330> tracing<00:06:59.780> the<00:07:00.110> problem

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
didn't work I'd keep tracing the problem

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.980 
didn't work I'd keep tracing the problem
back<00:07:00.710> til<00:07:00.980> I<00:07:01.010> found<00:07:01.400> it<00:07:02.590> with<00:07:03.590> the<00:07:03.860> AC<00:07:04.990> with

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
back til I found it with the AC with

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.260 
back til I found it with the AC with
that<00:07:06.200> relay<00:07:07.010> switched<00:07:07.430> out<00:07:07.700> you'll<00:07:07.940> now<00:07:08.120> be

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
that relay switched out you'll now be

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.690 
that relay switched out you'll now be
able<00:07:08.300> to<00:07:08.510> see<00:07:08.600> the<00:07:08.900> correct<00:07:10.510> operation<00:07:11.510> of<00:07:11.750> the

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
able to see the correct operation of the

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.370 
able to see the correct operation of the
compressor<00:07:13.700> clutch<00:07:13.990> looking<00:07:14.990> at<00:07:15.140> it<00:07:15.260> right

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
compressor clutch looking at it right

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.280 
compressor clutch looking at it right
now<00:07:15.440> now<00:07:15.950> the<00:07:16.010> end<00:07:16.550> is<00:07:16.820> not<00:07:17.030> turning<00:07:17.419> and<00:07:17.630> there

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.290 
now now the end is not turning and there

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.290 
now now the end is not turning and there
it<00:07:18.380> engages<00:07:18.770> you<00:07:19.160> actually<00:07:19.550> be<00:07:19.730> able<00:07:19.910> to<00:07:20.000> hear

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
it engages you actually be able to hear

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.280 
it engages you actually be able to hear
it<00:07:20.419> and<00:07:20.650> so<00:07:21.650> now<00:07:21.800> it's<00:07:22.010> turning<00:07:22.340> turning<00:07:23.290> this

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
it and so now it's turning turning this

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.260 
it and so now it's turning turning this
is<00:07:24.560> with<00:07:24.770> the<00:07:24.950> air<00:07:25.070> conditioner<00:07:25.610> on<00:07:25.790> the<00:07:26.060> whole

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
is with the air conditioner on the whole

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.570 
is with the air conditioner on the whole
time<00:07:26.540> the<00:07:27.440> whole<00:07:27.470> time<00:07:27.620> they're<00:07:27.980> conditioners

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
time the whole time they're conditioners

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.200 
time the whole time they're conditioners
on<00:07:28.850> the<00:07:30.430> compressor<00:07:31.430> will<00:07:31.610> run<00:07:31.850> only

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
on the compressor will run only

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.110 
on the compressor will run only
intermittently<00:07:32.750> so<00:07:33.080> now<00:07:33.230> it's<00:07:33.410> running<00:07:34.120> and

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 
intermittently so now it's running and

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.850 
intermittently so now it's running and
it<00:07:35.300> will<00:07:35.390> run<00:07:35.630> for<00:07:35.840> a<00:07:35.930> while<00:07:36.110> and<00:07:36.440> then<00:07:36.680> you'll

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
it will run for a while and then you'll

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.170 
it will run for a while and then you'll
hear<00:07:37.100> it<00:07:37.190> click<00:07:37.370> off<00:07:37.640> and<00:07:38.500> there<00:07:39.500> it<00:07:39.560> cooks<00:07:39.770> off

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
hear it click off and there it cooks off

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.550 
hear it click off and there it cooks off
I'll<00:07:41.180> stay<00:07:41.630> off<00:07:41.840> for<00:07:42.140> a<00:07:42.169> few<00:07:42.440> seconds<00:07:43.810> and<00:07:44.810> then

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 
I'll stay off for a few seconds and then

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.980 
I'll stay off for a few seconds and then
cycle<00:07:46.040> back<00:07:46.190> on<00:07:46.450> so<00:07:47.450> now<00:07:47.630> it's<00:07:47.780> working

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:47.990 
cycle back on so now it's working

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.290
