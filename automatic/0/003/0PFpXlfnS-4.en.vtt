00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 Oh 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.950
 your land project with a house 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.850
 straw on it is it always 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.550
 topical 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.380
 if so, we will make a short video 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.510
 on the subject to know 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.239
 the evolution and the means put in place 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.559
 to get it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.449
 yes of course the project is still 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.070
 topical 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.870
 the problem is always the lack of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 time the what I said damascus yves where 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.750
 exchanging loved my ideas my projects 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.729
 according to all kinds of context 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.640
 circumstances 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:01:01.059
 so that for the moment what we 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.010
 decided to make our family that's 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.820
 to go settle a place in a 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.320
 region we decided it did not load 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.080
 we want to buy a tax is not 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 all developed that without changing because 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.220
 we just wanted them 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.110
 move the box right away whose 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.409
 mama we will buy a land that wants 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.610
 you just grabbed earth preferably 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.260
 standing wood and then all she 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.450
 will be bought a toy shoot him down 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.920
 enough trees to build 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.380
 embodies aaron hunting for that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.050
 we make children a cottage and 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.930
 why a hunting camp because the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 four leaders are not subject to 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.050
 same building rules as the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.540
 other buildings 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.680
 for sure we are limited in the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.830
 size of a number of square meters 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.110
 we can build but given 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.060
 that it is to go and stay precisely 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.080
 for the hunt where she spent the week 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.100
 end recalled m 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.520
 Well, it's going to be enough 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.880
 then once the catch has built 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.580
 with an application structure on it 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.430
 ie for the food everything 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.610
 need there to be able to live there even 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.500
 c is very rustic way of living 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.750
 I will undertake the construction of 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.940
 our real home quietly 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.140
 slowly and I still want business 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.370
 a bundle of straw is long 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.080
 requires a lot of manpower 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.140
 that's why it's going to be interesting 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.550
 to have a hunting camp on site 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.410
 resources in tents 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.620
 I'm in a good evening guild 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.430
 able to take real sweet makes a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.489
 work day but it's okay 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.150
 allow the island live are placed from 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.700
 slowly and surely build the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.360
 author's house 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.500
 now do not ask me what is going 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.000
 to be the plans of the house the for the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 moment we have the evidence 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.519
 we have a good idea of â€‹â€‹what we want 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.250
 but we did not have the license 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:11.489
 the house that there will be ideally 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.470
 off the grid is a grid test 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.739
 is that but by legal obligation is 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.579
 connected to the electricity network 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.940
 it depends where the line of 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.620
 transmission had courage and hershey he 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 there are obligations that we are 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.320
 constrained and unfortunately we can 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.720
 to miss but definitively that 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.579
 is going to be a red house in the west that 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.799
 are going to be autonomous and who is going to be 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.489
 able to support the life of a 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.860
 family with all the facilities madam 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:49.380
 after it is true that 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:53.160
 the washing machine dryer what are you doing 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.520
 you finally see all that supposes 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.720
 a lot of prospecting because I do not 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.370
 will not necessarily buy the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.550
 lands that are less than we want 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.230
 find on the internet and who are 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.330
 usually much more expensive than this 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.250
 that I could pay if I do a 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.190
 research work 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.230
 luckily I have friends on the spot who 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.410
 are on the lookout for more seedlings 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.440
 a wish several proposals that have 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.430
 found land or houses 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.470
 isolated 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.460
 thank you for doing all that work for 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.330
 me 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.690
 then continue please 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.760
 needed soon but no joke 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.390
 it's still a project that requires 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.620
 a lot of preparation because it's 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.190
 completely changed region 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.080
 change of lifestyle change of environment 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.490
 obviously change jobs 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.160
 So we do not do it lightly 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.320
 for that we will go in stages and 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.950
 do I make a video on the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.060
 construction 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.590
 but of course but of course maybe 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.400
 not on all the secrets of the house 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.400
 but muller has built without tact the hearing 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.750
 and
