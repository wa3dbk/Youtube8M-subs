top end of the circuit before breaking
heart<00:00:49.100> into<00:00:49.760> this<00:00:49.850> right-hander<00:00:50.600> used<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.319> be

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
heart into this right-hander used to be

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.750 
heart into this right-hander used to be
quite<00:00:51.589> sending<00:00:52.010> through<00:00:52.159> there<00:00:52.399> but<00:00:52.429> it's

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
quite sending through there but it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.079 
quite sending through there but it's
down<00:00:52.999> to<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.239> bare<00:00:53.420> rock<00:00:54.249> this<00:00:55.249> year<00:00:55.550> through

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
down to the bare rock this year through

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.389 
down to the bare rock this year through
four<00:00:56.329> waves<00:00:56.600> not<00:00:57.079> quite<00:00:57.350> possible<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.010> double

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
four waves not quite possible to double

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.880 
four waves not quite possible to double
double<00:00:58.729> your<00:00:59.269> way<00:00:59.449> through<00:00:59.659> so<00:01:00.530> it's<00:01:00.679> just

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
double your way through so it's just

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.079 
double your way through so it's just
going<00:01:01.069> to<00:01:01.159> upset<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.519> balance<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.819> the<00:01:01.909> bike<00:01:02.059> a

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
going to upset the balance of the bike a

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.399 
going to upset the balance of the bike a
little<00:01:02.329> bit<00:01:02.510> just<00:01:02.719> towards<00:01:03.109> into<00:01:03.289> that

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
little bit just towards into that

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.229 
little bit just towards into that
section<00:01:03.649> let<00:01:04.220> me<00:01:04.309> go<00:01:04.430> through<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.790> left<00:01:04.940> drew

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
section let me go through the left drew

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.670 
section let me go through the left drew
the<00:01:05.360> right<00:01:05.510> drop<00:01:05.840> downhill<00:01:06.290> through<00:01:06.320> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
the right drop downhill through the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.340 
the right drop downhill through the
valley<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:07.280> back<00:01:07.490> up<00:01:07.930> almost<00:01:08.930> level

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
valley and then back up almost level

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.950 
valley and then back up almost level
with<00:01:09.460> turn<00:01:10.460> one<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:10.970> just<00:01:11.000> see<00:01:11.299> over<00:01:11.600> there<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
with turn one you just see over there to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.990 
with turn one you just see over there to
the<00:01:11.990> right<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:13.100> was<00:01:13.250> chiro<00:01:13.580> knees<00:01:13.760> corner

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
the right this was chiro knees corner

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.630 
the right this was chiro knees corner
from<00:01:14.120> last<00:01:14.330> year<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.260> we<00:01:15.409> head<00:01:15.620> over<00:01:15.860> one<00:01:16.520> of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
from last year then we head over one of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.570 
from last year then we head over one of
the<00:01:16.760> huge<00:01:17.120> table<00:01:17.510> tops<00:01:17.720> here<00:01:18.340> dropping<00:01:19.340> down

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
the huge table tops here dropping down

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.400 
the huge table tops here dropping down
hill<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.150> then<00:01:20.300> into<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:20.810> short<00:01:21.290> little

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
hill and then into this short little

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.220 
hill and then into this short little
tabletop<00:01:22.390> right<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.780> entry<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
tabletop right on the entry to the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.280 
tabletop right on the entry to the
corner

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
corner

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
corner
and<00:01:26.070> there'll<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> choice<00:01:26.580> alive<00:01:26.850> through

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and there'll be a choice alive through

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
and there'll be a choice alive through
there<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.360> well<00:01:27.510> come<00:01:27.750> race<00:01:27.930> day<00:01:28.310> exit<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
there as well come race day exit the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.860 
there as well come race day exit the
turn<00:01:29.580> slightly<00:01:30.540> uphill<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> F<00:01:31.620> candor

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
turn slightly uphill into the F candor

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.000 
turn slightly uphill into the F candor
and<00:01:33.870> then<00:01:34.050> because<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.440> see<00:01:34.650> we're

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
and then because you can see we're

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.940 
and then because you can see we're
through<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.850> left<00:01:36.090> over<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.260> waves<00:01:37.590> it's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
through the left over for waves it's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.110 
through the left over for waves it's
double<00:01:38.250> double<00:01:38.490> through<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.850> before

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
double double through there before

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.330 
double double through there before
plunging<00:01:39.390> back<00:01:39.720> downhill<00:01:39.960> into<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.830> bank's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
plunging back downhill into the bank's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
plunging back downhill into the bank's
right-hander<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.660> start<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.110> drop<00:01:46.350> down

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
right-hander and we start to drop down

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
right-hander and we start to drop down
and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.220> over<00:01:47.370> tabletop<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.960> get

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and then up over tabletop you can get

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.540 
and then up over tabletop you can get
all<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.440> way<00:01:49.530> over<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.370> run

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
all the way over it but you have to run

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.310 
all the way over it but you have to run
wide<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.120> next<00:01:51.330> corner<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.870> most<00:01:52.080> riders

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
wide in the next corner so most riders

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
wide in the next corner so most riders
just<00:01:52.950> plop<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.490> top<00:01:53.670> drop<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> off

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just plop it on to the top drop it off

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
just plop it on to the top drop it off
the<00:01:54.330> end<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.920> trying<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.220> hold<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> nice

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the end and then trying to hold a nice
