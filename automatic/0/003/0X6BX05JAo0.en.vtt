brake fluid to your Honda cb750 I'm
going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.809> using<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.349> CB<00:00:13.860> 750<00:00:14.280> F<00:00:14.610> 1975<00:00:15.599> but

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
going to be using a CB 750 F 1975 but
this<00:00:16.800> technique<00:00:17.340> applies<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.150> many<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this technique applies to many of the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
this technique applies to many of the
cb750<00:00:19.410> s<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.740> actually<00:00:20.010> many<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
cb750 s and actually many of the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250 
cb750 s and actually many of the
motorcycles<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.119> there<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.600> hopefully<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
motorcycles out there so hopefully you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.019 
motorcycles out there so hopefully you
can<00:00:22.380> learn<00:00:22.439> how<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.100> yourself<00:00:23.220> okay

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
can learn how to do this yourself okay

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.230 
can learn how to do this yourself okay
let's<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:25.400> now<00:00:26.400> brake<00:00:26.730> fluid<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.210> a

so<00:04:03.510> that's<00:04:03.690> what<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> put<00:04:04.170> into<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.770> dot<00:04:05.370> 3

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
so that's what I put into this one dot 3

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.510 
so that's what I put into this one dot 3
brake<00:04:05.940> fluid<00:04:06.630> if<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:07.200> says<00:04:07.410> dot<00:04:07.650> four<00:04:07.980> use<00:04:08.280> dot

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
brake fluid if it says dot four use dot

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.630 
brake fluid if it says dot four use dot
four<00:04:08.880> if<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.120> says<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.480> five<00:04:09.750> use<00:04:10.080> dot<00:04:10.260> five
