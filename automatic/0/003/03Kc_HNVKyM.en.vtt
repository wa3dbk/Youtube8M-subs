00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.620
 key 1 to save getting the 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.779
 authentic financial freedom supposes 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.969
 have money to live on 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.639
 years even if you do not have income for your 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.009
 I work to build a good mattress 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.650
 the usual financial thing is to consider 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.510
 save the traditional method consists 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.060
 in saving what we have left at the end of 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.250
 month the problem is that at the beginning of 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.759
 month we pay the mortgage on the house the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.740
 car insurance light and so on then 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.200
 We have day-to-day expenses as 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.570
 eat go out with friends buy the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.110
 newspaper look at what a beautiful watch 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.660
 I need a new sweater and so on 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.390
 result is that at the end of the month just 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.640
 we have nothing saved no matter the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.309
 salary coppers everyone when 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.219
 we have money we end up spending it and not 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.800
 we save for that to save does not work 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.719
 if we want to get our freedom 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.719
 financially we have to forget about 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.550
 save and start to preah save for 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.350
 save is to withdraw another 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.690
 count a part of your salary at 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.909
 beginning of each month just before 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.130
 come to your pocket and you can spend it 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.590
 the difference with traditional savings 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.420
 is that with the pre-savings there is a part 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.909
 of your salary with which you do not count from 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.399
 a principle and you avoid the temptation to 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.850
 spend it like that without you noticing 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.340
 you start saving the only thing you have 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.349
 what to do to start preparing is to go 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.939
 to your bank and give order that all 

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:30.429
 months your bank transfers 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.649
 automatically a part of your salary to 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.149
 a savings account you choose the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.829
 amount of salary that you want to pre 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.219
 save the least to get 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.049
 results is 10% of your salary to 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.140
 from there you can book a 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.050
 higher percentage 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 you decide after all the more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.830
 quickly pre save before 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.320
 you will achieve your dreams of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.229
 Financial Freedom 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.940
 Also if your salary goes up you can add 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.250
 that extra money to what I already pre 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.320
 you saved every month 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.360
 surely you will think if that is very 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.369
 well and it's very easy to take a 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.330
 amount at the beginning of each month but 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.400
 how do I live without that 10% or more 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.890
 When I start, I'll know how to save, you'll observe 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.290
 something curious the first month yes that 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.020
 you will notice that 10% less than you have for 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.780
 spend the second month you will notice less and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.850
 the third month nothing your level of spending is 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.430
 will have adapted as if by magic to the new 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.160
 income level and if you want to increase 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.770
 even more your pre-savings level reduces 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.320
 your expenses domiciled when 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.090
 domiciliary a payment you are less conscious 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.580
 what it means to you and your 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.620
 finances that many know very well 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.340
 companies like electric companies 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.690
 telephone subscriptions to magazines 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.370
 insurance 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.470
 the point is that you can know that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.290
 every month the bank withdraws you 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.630
 twenty euros of your monthly subscription to 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.370
 the magazine you are today but the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.590
 reality is that you are not fully 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.660
 aware of it like those twenty 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.640
 euros are money that never reaches your 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.130
 pocket you do not realize your loss 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.220
 and that you could spend it on something that 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.650
 I would like much more or pre save 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.900
 that is why direct payments act 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.910
 as the dark side of pre savings 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.340
 They take away money automatically without 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.200
 that you realize in a simple way 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.120
 to increase your pre- level even more 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.030
 saving is to minimize 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.950
 essential your domiciled expenses and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.620
 avoid domicile your expenses in the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.870
 future another way to increase your level 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 pre- saving is to save your increases of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.290
 salary 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.890
 when we have money in our pocket it 's 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.600
 very difficult not to spend it if you enter the 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.790
 shopping center with pockets 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.250
 full and you see that video game that so much 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.200
 like or those pants that would seat you 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.480
 great you have to make an effort to 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.550
 superhuman will not to buy them 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.410
 The same thing happens when we receive a 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.000
 increase in salary at work we 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.310
 we found more money in the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.590
 pocket so our spending level 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.010
 it immediately rises and adapts to the new 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.930
 income level a very simple way 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.810
 to break the spiral of rising spending 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.250
 is to save the salary increases like the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.590
 money from the raise does not reach your 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.320
 pocket you never have the temptation to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.110
 increase your spending level you save without 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.940
 no effort of will during the 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.340
 ten first years of working life of 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.170
 people are frequent that their salary 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.510
 I got to double what I received when 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.430
 started using the pre-trick 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.350
 save the salary increases you 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.140
 it will be very easy to save 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.390
 every month an amount 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.790
 considerable without any effort 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.530
 to preah save and go to your first step 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.530
 to get financial freedom
