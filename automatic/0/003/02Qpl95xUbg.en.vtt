weapon<00:00:18.449> gameplay<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> be

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
weapon gameplay so we're going to be

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.140 
weapon gameplay so we're going to be
spectating<00:00:20.010> me<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> moment<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
spectating me at the moment with the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.240 
spectating me at the moment with the
regular<00:00:21.600> 57<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.230> we're<00:00:22.439> also<00:00:22.590> occasionally

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
regular 57 and we're also occasionally

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
regular 57 and we're also occasionally
going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> switch<00:00:23.609> over<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.000> demised<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
going to switch over to demised with the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230 
going to switch over to demised with the
gold<00:00:25.560> 57<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> guys<00:00:26.760> should<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:27.029> able<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
gold 57 so you guys should be able to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.269 
gold 57 so you guys should be able to
differentiate<00:00:27.630> fairly<00:00:28.470> easily<00:00:28.650> between<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
differentiate fairly easily between the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
differentiate fairly easily between the
two<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.670> won't<00:00:29.820> put<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> name<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.900> top

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
two so i won't put a name in the top

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.840 
two so i won't put a name in the top
corner<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.679> video<00:00:32.070> took<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.669> an

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
corner now this video took about an

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.900 
corner now this video took about an
extra<00:00:33.270> hour<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:34.110> put<00:00:34.350> together<00:00:34.670> compared<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
extra hour to put together compared to a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
extra hour to put together compared to a
regular<00:00:36.230> video<00:00:37.230> obviously<00:00:37.380> there's<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> know

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
regular video obviously there's you know

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
regular video obviously there's you know
maybe<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.730> hour<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> gameplay

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
maybe an hour or two into the gameplay

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
maybe an hour or two into the gameplay
then<00:00:40.860> usually<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> half<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.149> hour

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
then usually it's kind of half an hour

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
then usually it's kind of half an hour
into<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:44.070> from<00:00:44.280> having<00:00:44.430> gameplay

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
into actually going from having gameplay

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
into actually going from having gameplay
to<00:00:45.000> having<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> video<00:00:45.660> whereas<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.170> took

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to having a video whereas this took

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.959 
to having a video whereas this took
about<00:00:46.469> an<00:00:46.620> hour<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> half<00:00:47.129> because<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.789> had

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
about an hour and a half because I had

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.400 
about an hour and a half because I had
to<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.420> record<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.110> gameplay

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to you know record the two gameplay

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.860 
to you know record the two gameplay
separately<00:00:50.280> watch<00:00:50.789> them<00:00:51.059> both<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.780> know

write<00:00:52.110> down<00:00:52.289> key<00:00:52.530> points<00:00:52.890> where<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.070> wanted<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
write down key points where I wanted to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
write down key points where I wanted to
be<00:00:53.699> spectating<00:00:54.600> each<00:00:54.780> player<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.590> know

be spectating each player you know
points<00:00:56.010> where<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> might<00:00:56.340> fast<00:00:56.640> forward<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
points where I might fast forward that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.479 
points where I might fast forward that
kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> stuff<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.320> basically<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.399> I'm

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
kind of stuff so basically what I'm

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.830 
kind of stuff so basically what I'm
trying<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> say<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> fair<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.629> effort

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
trying to say is a fair bit more effort

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
trying to say is a fair bit more effort
went<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.649> i<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.100> well

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
went into this but i think it was well

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
went into this but i think it was well
worth<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.789> i<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> game<00:01:03.719> plays<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> know

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
worth it i think the game plays you know

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.039 
worth it i think the game plays you know
much<00:01:04.439> more<00:01:04.470> engaging<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.549> fast-paced

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
much more engaging more fast-paced

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.539 
much more engaging more fast-paced

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
enjoyable more enjoyable to watch I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.890 
enjoyable more enjoyable to watch I
think<00:01:08.790> anyway<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.390> watching<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.780> back

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
think anyway just from watching it back

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
think anyway just from watching it back
now<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.700> Jack<00:01:12.000> getting

the<00:01:12.390> bloodthirsty<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.560> I'm

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the bloodthirsty there and then I'm

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.080 
the bloodthirsty there and then I'm
gonna<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.220> own<00:01:14.250> little<00:01:14.490> streak<00:01:14.850> here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

my content used to be absolutely

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.259 
my content used to be absolutely
terrible<00:03:33.799> I'm<00:03:34.799> not<00:03:35.220> gonna<00:03:35.370> lie<00:03:35.489> obviously<00:03:36.239> I

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
terrible I'm not gonna lie obviously I

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.689 
terrible I'm not gonna lie obviously I
wasn't<00:03:36.599> you<00:03:36.989> know<00:03:37.310> practiced<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.400> using

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
wasn't you know practiced in using

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.119 
wasn't you know practiced in using
editing<00:03:39.090> software<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.840> wasn't<00:03:40.349> really<00:03:40.680> I

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
editing software I wasn't really I

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.619 
editing software I wasn't really I
didn't<00:03:41.370> really<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.549> much<00:03:41.669> feedback<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.449> go

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
didn't really have much feedback to go

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.839 
didn't really have much feedback to go
on<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.680> thought<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.220> was<00:03:44.340> fine<00:03:44.579> but

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
on and I thought it was fine but

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.939 
on and I thought it was fine but
obviously<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.750> quality<00:03:46.139> was<00:03:46.260> lacking<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.799> I

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
obviously the quality was lacking and I

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.099 
obviously the quality was lacking and I
could<00:03:47.159> be<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> similar<00:03:47.760> point<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.959> i<00:03:48.989> just

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
could be a similar point here so i just

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.809 
could be a similar point here so i just
wanted<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.560> hear<00:03:49.709> from<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.010> guys<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.699> know
