00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
release this got really excited because

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.929 
release this got really excited because
you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.590> owned<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.009> Spyderco<00:01:41.640> techno

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
you know if you owned a Spyderco techno

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.870 
you know if you owned a Spyderco techno
units<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.119> same<00:01:45.450> designer<00:01:46.070> Marcin<00:01:47.070> slit

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
units by the same designer Marcin slit

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.359 
units by the same designer Marcin slit
so<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.270> his<00:01:48.540> name<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
so I think his name is

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
so I think his name is
so<00:01:50.369> same<00:01:50.700> same<00:01:51.299> type<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> finish<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> guys

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
so same same type of finish as you guys

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
so same same type of finish as you guys
could<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:53.180> look<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:55.670> look<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.909> edge

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
could see look at that look at that edge

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.709 
could see look at that look at that edge
