00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 the pertinaz in 1956 in california and his 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.529
 maximum category is the kz2 look at 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.800
 this detail with Fernando Alonso with 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 engines of 200 of 125 45 horses 6 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.590
 marches 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.880
 reach speeds that approach 200 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.440
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.270
 the hunting equipment wheels moved 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.220
 benamariel to where we are 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 with our best driver 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 here we are whistling ne the whistling of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 penalty sea ​​and the one that the 1.4 circuit 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.199
 kilometers we are with andrés castro 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.970
 Galician a very young promise of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.300
 world of karting we hope to see 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.430
 because not soon in higher formulas 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 André how old are you running 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.710
 it came from 2008 so let's do 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.760
 already five years and another little you are 21 years old 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 and we are seeing now to begin with 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 a race right here on this circuit 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.930
 with Fernando Alonso who goes behind 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 you exact and not a good day is not a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.170
 race exactly one day comes 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.050
 train before a formula race 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.820
 1 and here we write together is giving 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.070
 we see that in almost four laps it was not 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.200
 able to overtake tea not that's something 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.540
 to remember then that a lot of people 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.940
 he was here he saw it and he stayed 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.090
 Astonished but good and the car was 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.810
 better than you I more expensive 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.060
 well, I did not know how good it is 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 andrés castro gallego driving 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.490
 intelligent and vertiginous a kart made 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 for the same lot of talent wins and 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.509
 few means Andre only needs 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.369
 keep competing with them 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.049
 resources than the rest because without a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.640
 team behind demonstrates in each race 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.340
 that has a tom that is not bought with 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.609
 money that if they have the children of 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.280
 but they are behind languages ​​since 2008 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.920
 running social careers and 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.829
 regional and even national what 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.700
 difference there is between tailors 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.939
 mainly the level of participants 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.209
 as you go increasing regional 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.469
 There is a national level for both 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.750
 superior piloting as economic 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.149
 Well, it's a sport that demands one 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.009
 maintenance costs kart 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.539
 etcetera etcetera you are always in 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.130
 looking for sponsors or that's 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.230
 exactly this 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.660
 we have a good economy 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.820
 then our expenditures loose 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.340
 we are pulling with them but of course already 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.290
 want to increase of more category we have 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.210
 would ascend a little more then clear of 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.980
 missing sponsors because we do not 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.930
 we can since we make a 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.850
 call to workshops dealers of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.640
 insurance cars and so on so that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.470
 put on your monkey your brand because sure 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.780
 that André Castro Galician is going to take her 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.440
 far away 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.440
 anywhere 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.670
 but good 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.709
 what is clear is that nobody doubts 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.599
 your talent is this a sport in which 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.790
 if you have talent with security you arrive 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.879
 up or unfortunately not only 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.950
 talent is currently influencing the most 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.530
 economic level than the other talent 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.530
 fans of this sport with more 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.640
 money have two three four engines you 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.530
 you have to manage all the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.069
 season with the same these wheels of 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.200
 back you tell me they are four years old 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.069
 the certain wheels that have four 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.749
 years the engines, of course, having one is 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.249
 delays a lot because it is with the 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.079
 you have to run and what you have 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.389
 to train and it shows a lot in the 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.969
 engine wear that put a lot more 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.500
 money in this sport we have seen the 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.450
 experience of other pilots are usually 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.939
 parents who from very young 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.549
 they accompany you puts the effort in your hands 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.859
 the money the time your father there you 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.129
 supports a lot not always always supported 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.469
 is the one that has trusted me the most and 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.469
 thank you and your girlfriend also 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.989
 we have supported morally a lot about 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.629
 everything very well has always been with me 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.969
 and also a lot of character does not ask for big 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.949
 amounts with contributions of only two 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.599
 Andros zeros could start in 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.699
 December and the preseason and fight for 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.500
 the national championship I assure you that 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.930
 with just six thousand euros to beat and the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.969
 they have 30,000 and a whole team now 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.000
 same if our support would have to 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.519
 leave it let's see if institutions 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.009
 scouts marks someone will notice 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.500
 andrés castro gallego a leonese who 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.270
 he deserves to be supported 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.710
 and to show his talent because what 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.320
 We are seeing with Fernando Alonso not 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.720
 was able to overcome him and it's already good 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.490
 truncate the future of those who are worth more 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.800
 four laps with alonso to the slipstream 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.590
 dance and credibility of this lion is 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.510
 unstoppable a real best and behind the wheel 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.820
 who surrendered his feet to himself 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.700
 two-time world champion before a few 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.190
 witnesses because the true loves are 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.110

 his love of karting to the whole world 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.460
 when we understand that there are geniuses 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.460
 that help in bad times it 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.680
 that we give we will receive it has surpassed 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.210
