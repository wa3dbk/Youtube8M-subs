normally there was in the green

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.890 
normally there was in the green
background<00:02:36.519> are<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> kind<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.269> seed<00:02:37.600> shots

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
background are the kind of seed shots

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.940 
background are the kind of seed shots
the<00:02:38.110> ones<00:02:38.260> where<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> kind<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.769> sit

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the ones where you have to kind of sit

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.229 
the ones where you have to kind of sit
down<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.310> can't<00:02:39.549> move<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.090> fire

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
down you can't move but you can fire

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.880 
down you can't move but you can fire
them<00:02:40.360> out<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.570> do<00:02:40.660> some<00:02:40.810> massive<00:02:41.049> damage<00:02:41.230> there

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
them out to do some massive damage there

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.380 
them out to do some massive damage there
is<00:02:42.010> however<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.340> shot<00:02:42.730> which<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.150> blend

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
is however one shot which is a blend

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.420 
is however one shot which is a blend
between<00:02:43.600> both<00:02:43.989> green<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.350> blue<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.130> seems

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
between both green and blue so it seems

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.400 
between both green and blue so it seems
like<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:45.820> an<00:02:45.910> inbuilt<00:02:46.330> sechelt<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.260> that's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
like it's an inbuilt sechelt so that's

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.050 
like it's an inbuilt sechelt so that's
going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.560> be<00:02:47.620> pretty<00:02:47.920> damn<00:02:48.220> powerful<00:02:48.430> we

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
going to be pretty damn powerful we

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.280 
going to be pretty damn powerful we
don't<00:02:49.209> know<00:02:49.299> too<00:02:49.360> much<00:02:49.540> about<00:02:49.600> them<00:02:49.930> yet<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.230> I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
don't know too much about them yet but I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.360 
don't know too much about them yet but I
imagine<00:02:50.590> there'll<00:02:50.709> be<00:02:50.739> pretty<00:02:50.920> cool<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.220> also

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
imagine there'll be pretty cool and also

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.890 
imagine there'll be pretty cool and also
kind<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:51.820> matchup<00:02:52.329> with<00:02:52.480> say<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
kind of like matchup with say like the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.330 
kind of like matchup with say like the
weapon<00:02:53.140> itself<00:02:53.200> or<00:02:53.650> like<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.829> monster<00:02:54.010> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
weapon itself or like the monster you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.530 
weapon itself or like the monster you
know<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.549> they<00:02:54.640> might<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:54.880> like<00:02:55.000> elemental

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
know so they might be like elemental

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.000 
know so they might be like elemental
that<00:02:55.810> could<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.019> like<00:02:56.170> particularly<00:02:56.890> powerful

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
that could be like particularly powerful

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.039 
that could be like particularly powerful
either<00:02:57.549> way<00:02:57.760> we'll<00:02:57.940> find<00:02:58.120> out<00:02:58.180> more<00:02:58.299> soon<00:02:58.360> but

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
either way we'll find out more soon but

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.080 
either way we'll find out more soon but
that<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.260> something<00:02:59.380> worth<00:02:59.650> noting<00:03:00.100> then

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that is something worth noting then

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.460 
that is something worth noting then
moving<00:03:01.269> on<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.420> arrow<00:03:01.630> style<00:03:01.989> I'm<00:03:02.230> sure<00:03:02.380> you

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
moving on to arrow style I'm sure you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.810 
moving on to arrow style I'm sure you
guys<00:03:02.560> know<00:03:02.620> exactly<00:03:03.100> what<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.430> by<00:03:03.519> now<00:03:03.670> if

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
guys know exactly what this is by now if

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.920 
guys know exactly what this is by now if
you've<00:03:03.940> seen<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.360> other<00:03:04.480> weapon<00:03:04.720> demos

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
you've seen all the other weapon demos

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.240 
you've seen all the other weapon demos
then<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:05.350> basically<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.769> same<00:03:05.950> every<00:03:06.220> time

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
then it's basically the same every time

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.069 
then it's basically the same every time
you<00:03:06.700> roll<00:03:06.790> towards<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.060> monster<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.900> touch

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
you roll towards the monster you touch

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.330 
you roll towards the monster you touch
it<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.290> launched<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.829> air<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.160> then

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
it it launched you in the air and then

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.319 
it it launched you in the air and then
from<00:03:09.459> there<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.760> then<00:03:10.000> launch<00:03:10.180> some

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
from there you can then launch some

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.789 
from there you can then launch some
attacks<00:03:10.600> over<00:03:10.900> its<00:03:10.989> back<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.680> obviously

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
attacks over its back this is obviously

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.900 
attacks over its back this is obviously
a<00:03:11.980> place<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.280> wouldn't<00:03:12.430> normally<00:03:12.610> go<00:03:12.850> to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
a place you wouldn't normally go to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.940 
a place you wouldn't normally go to
reach<00:03:13.150> unless<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.720> knocked<00:03:13.900> over<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.799> one

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
reach unless you knocked over the one

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.020 
reach unless you knocked over the one
thing<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.220> worth<00:03:15.400> calling<00:03:15.610> out<00:03:15.790> it's

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
thing that is worth calling out it's

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.039 
thing that is worth calling out it's
actually<00:03:16.239> something<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.480> made<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.630> little<00:03:16.900> bit

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
actually something I made a little bit

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.660 
actually something I made a little bit
of<00:03:17.110> mistake<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.799> light<00:03:18.040> photon<00:03:18.370> video<00:03:18.579> the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
of mistake in the light photon video the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.699 
of mistake in the light photon video the
other<00:03:18.760> day<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.049> actually<00:03:20.200> mount<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
other day but you can actually mount a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.440 
other day but you can actually mount a
monster<00:03:21.070> with<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> bogan<00:03:21.760> both<00:03:22.030> light<00:03:22.299> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
monster with a bogan both light and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.270 
monster with a bogan both light and
heavy<00:03:22.780> simply<00:03:23.320> by<00:03:23.440> shooting<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:23.920> on<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.100> back

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
heavy simply by shooting it on the back

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.590 
heavy simply by shooting it on the back
you<00:03:24.430> don't<00:03:24.519> actually<00:03:24.730> need<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.120> use<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.360> melee

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
you don't actually need to use the melee

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.210 
you don't actually need to use the melee
attack<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.019> can<00:03:26.200> use<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.769> don't<00:03:26.950> need<00:03:27.070> to

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
attack you can use it you don't need to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.949 
attack you can use it you don't need to
use<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.209> can<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.420> sort<00:03:28.630> jump<00:03:28.870> those

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
use it so you can just sort jump those

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.300 
use it so you can just sort jump those
back<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.470> if<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.680> again<00:03:29.860> at<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.160> right

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
back and if it's again at the right

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.860 
back and if it's again at the right
threshold<00:03:30.549> then<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.150> can<00:03:31.329> result<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.780> a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
threshold then that can result in a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.410 
threshold then that can result in a
mount<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:33.610> finally<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
mount and then finally you have the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.030 
mount and then finally you have the
hunting<00:03:34.989> skill<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.650> called<00:03:35.829> these

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
hunting skill this is called these

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.890 
hunting skill this is called these
supernovae<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.060> doesn't<00:03:37.360> really<00:03:37.600> need<00:03:37.780> much

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
supernovae it doesn't really need much

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.810 
supernovae it doesn't really need much
explanation<00:03:38.079> you<00:03:38.680> fire<00:03:38.950> out<00:03:39.100> this<00:03:39.280> massive

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
explanation you fire out this massive

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.090 
explanation you fire out this massive

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.520 
wide range of attack if you're so pay
attention<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> very<00:03:46.900> beginning<00:03:47.049> part

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
attention to the very beginning part

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.240 
attention to the very beginning part
would<00:03:47.650> actually<00:03:47.889> show<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
would actually show you the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.040 
would actually show you the
supernova<00:03:48.700> you're<00:03:49.120> also<00:03:49.270> seen<00:03:49.540> as<00:03:49.720> able<00:03:49.960> to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
supernova you're also seen as able to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.330 
supernova you're also seen as able to
knock<00:03:50.260> down<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.620> kind<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:50.830> destructive

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
knock down that kind of destructive

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.980 
knock down that kind of destructive
apart<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.670> level<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.210> imagine<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.690> areas

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
apart the level so I imagine the areas

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.480 
apart the level so I imagine the areas
where<00:03:53.110> normally<00:03:53.590> only<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.980> monsters<00:03:54.370> would

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
where normally only the monsters would

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.040 
where normally only the monsters would
be<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.730> break<00:03:54.880> them<00:03:55.090> now<00:03:55.660> if<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.930> use<00:03:56.020> the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
be to break them now if you use the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.620 
be to break them now if you use the
supernova<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.980> can<00:03:57.280> too<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.210> kind<00:03:58.570> of

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
supernova you can too so that kind of

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.910 
supernova you can too so that kind of
goes<00:03:58.720> lengths<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.140> sort<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.350> illustrate<00:03:59.650> quite

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
goes lengths to sort of illustrate quite

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.710 
goes lengths to sort of illustrate quite
how<00:04:00.040> powerful<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.460> is<00:04:00.490> but<00:04:01.300> this<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.510> going<00:04:01.660> to

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
how powerful it is but this is going to

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.420 
how powerful it is but this is going to
add<00:04:01.810> some<00:04:01.840> incredible<00:04:02.470> firepower<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:03.130> an

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
add some incredible firepower to an

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.760 
add some incredible firepower to an
already<00:04:03.640> powerful<00:04:04.090> weapon<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.660> that's<00:04:05.500> my

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
already powerful weapon and that's my

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.260 
already powerful weapon and that's my
friends<00:04:06.100> brings<00:04:06.459> me<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.730> end<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:07.150> this
