the divine UI Gold Edition you'll notice
there's<00:03:04.970> both<00:03:05.180> an<00:03:05.300> MBR<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.140> an<00:03:06.260> MVC<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.100> that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
there's both an MBR and an MVC and that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.100 
there's both an MBR and an MVC and that
stands<00:03:07.460> for<00:03:07.550> main<00:03:07.790> bar<00:03:08.030> right<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.540> made<00:03:08.810> Mars

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
stands for main bar right and made Mars

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.020 
stands for main bar right and made Mars
center<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.160> can<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:10.820> actually

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
center so you can do is you can actually

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.390 
center so you can do is you can actually
move<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:12.260> one<00:03:12.560> through<00:03:12.860> equal<00:03:13.160> signs

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
move that one through equal signs

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.080 
move that one through equal signs
section<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:14.000> your<00:03:14.270> toolbar<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.680> side<00:03:16.090> you

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
section of your toolbar to the side you

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
section of your toolbar to the side you
can<00:03:17.209> move<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.630> right<00:03:17.989> or<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.200> left<00:03:18.380> I'm

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
can move it to the right or the left I'm

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.900 
can move it to the right or the left I'm
guessing<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.130> probably<00:03:19.280> move<00:03:19.520> top<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
guessing you can probably move top and

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.690 
guessing you can probably move top and
bottom<00:03:20.090> if<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.239> wanted<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.310> I'm<00:03:22.400> going

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
bottom if you wanted to and so I'm going

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.130 
bottom if you wanted to and so I'm going
went<00:03:23.150> ahead<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.360> selected<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.720> now<00:03:24.110> I

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
went ahead and selected it now I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.590 
went ahead and selected it now I
selected<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.830> MBR<00:03:25.700> which<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.000> main<00:03:26.150> bar<00:03:26.330> right

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
selected the MBR which is main bar right

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.780 
selected the MBR which is main bar right
but<00:03:27.410> you'll<00:03:27.530> notice<00:03:27.680> things<00:03:28.010> don't<00:03:28.400> quite

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
but you'll notice things don't quite

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.970 
but you'll notice things don't quite
look<00:03:29.090> right<00:03:29.170> don't<00:03:30.170> panic<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.650> pretty

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
look right don't panic this is pretty

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.560 
look right don't panic this is pretty
common<00:03:31.190> essentially<00:03:32.000> what<00:03:32.090> happens<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.450> when

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
common essentially what happens is when

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.090 
common essentially what happens is when
you<00:03:32.600> load<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> game<00:03:33.050> certain<00:03:33.590> things<00:03:33.739> get<00:03:33.890> pre

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
you load the game certain things get pre

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.310 
you load the game certain things get pre
cached<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.489> predefined<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:36.050> is<00:03:36.170> one<00:03:36.290> of

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
cached and predefined and this is one of

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.530 
cached and predefined and this is one of
those<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.770> you<00:03:36.830> have<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.310> do<00:03:38.209> want<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.420> be

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
those that you have to do want to be

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.740 
those that you have to do want to be
tried<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.140> trued<00:03:39.430> computer<00:03:40.430> fixes<00:03:40.940> which<00:03:41.540> is

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
tried and trued computer fixes which is

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.650 
tried and trued computer fixes which is
start<00:03:42.700> reset<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> client<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.330> basically<00:03:44.540> just

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
start reset the client so basically just

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.300 
start reset the client so basically just
exit<00:03:45.080> out<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.170> lotro<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.739> bring<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:45.980> back<00:03:46.040> up

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
exit out a lotro and bring it back up

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.860 
exit out a lotro and bring it back up
and<00:03:46.550> you'll<00:03:46.970> go<00:03:47.120> ahead<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.510> add<00:03:47.660> things

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and you'll go ahead and add things

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.000 
and you'll go ahead and add things
looking<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.260> way<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.530> expect<00:03:48.769> them<00:03:48.920> to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
looking the way that you expect them to

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.800 
looking the way that you expect them to
so<00:03:49.459> if<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.640> ever<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:50.330> through<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.570> play<00:03:50.630> all

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
so if you ever go through and play all

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.060 
so if you ever go through and play all
of<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.959> UI<00:03:51.080> scans<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.709> see<00:03:51.890> something

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
of the UI scans and you see something

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.220 
of the UI scans and you see something
doesn't<00:03:52.310> quite<00:03:52.610> look<00:03:52.790> right<00:03:53.019> always<00:03:54.019> go<00:03:54.170> ahead

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
doesn't quite look right always go ahead

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.170 
doesn't quite look right always go ahead
and<00:03:54.530> exit<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.980> game<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.400> then<00:03:55.550> pop<00:03:55.760> back<00:03:55.790> up

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and exit the game and then pop back up

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.479 
and exit the game and then pop back up
and<00:03:56.840> you'll<00:03:56.959> see<00:03:57.200> this<00:03:58.010> way<00:03:58.160> looking<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.459> way

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
and you'll see this way looking the way

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.160 
and you'll see this way looking the way
you<00:03:58.580> want<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.330> switch<00:03:59.810> over<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.050> my

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
you want it to so switch over to my

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.430 
you want it to so switch over to my
captain<00:04:00.410> here<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.550> is<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.660> same<00:04:03.110> user

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
captain here and this is that same user

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.540 
captain here and this is that same user
interface<00:04:03.500> but<00:04:04.040> now<00:04:04.130> looking<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.430> way<00:04:04.459> that

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
interface but now looking the way that

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.740 
interface but now looking the way that
should<00:04:04.820> look<00:04:04.970> associate<00:04:05.390> on<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.540> bottom

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
should look associate on the bottom

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.860 
should look associate on the bottom
right<00:04:05.900> there<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.140> have<00:04:06.350> my<00:04:06.459> toolbars<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:08.150> set

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
right there I have my toolbars and set

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.479 
right there I have my toolbars and set
up<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:08.989> that<00:04:09.320> way<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:09.860> essentially

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
up that that way and this is essentially

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.280 
up that that way and this is essentially
this<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.760> exact<00:04:11.090> same<00:04:11.330> user<00:04:11.989> interface

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
this is the exact same user interface

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.410 
this is the exact same user interface
that<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:13.010> had<00:04:13.130> on<00:04:13.220> my<00:04:13.250> burglar<00:04:13.580> just<00:04:14.120> now<00:04:14.239> it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
sits after I restarted now and I've also

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.430

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
loaded up a couple of Lua plugins so in

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.290 
loaded up a couple of Lua plugins so in
this<00:04:22.160> case<00:04:22.370> first<00:04:22.789> one<00:04:22.910> here<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.180> was<00:04:23.270> just

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
this case first one here that was just

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.760 
this case first one here that was just
kind<00:04:23.539> of<00:04:23.570> Mouse<00:04:23.690> ground<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.200> was<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.560> the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
kind of Mouse ground that was that the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.500 
kind of Mouse ground that was that the
two<00:04:25.070> little<00:04:25.310> parentheses<00:04:25.760> that's

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
two little parentheses that's

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.300 
two little parentheses that's
allows<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.500> bring<00:04:27.590> up<00:04:27.710> your<00:04:27.830> health<00:04:27.980> and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
morale displays that way it also does

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.410 
morale displays that way it also does
some<00:04:30.770> other<00:04:30.800> things<00:04:30.890> with<00:04:31.160> regards<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.550> wounds
