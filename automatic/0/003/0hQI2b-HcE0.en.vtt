00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
example where everybody when every

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.540 
example where everybody when every
smaller<00:03:55.920> group<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:57.590> master<00:03:58.590> their<00:03:59.070> own<00:03:59.340> music

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
smaller group can master their own music

of<00:04:00.000> course<00:04:00.330> with<00:04:00.510> my<00:04:00.690> help<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.200> then<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:01.560> have

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
of course with my help and then we have

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.520 
of course with my help and then we have
three<00:04:02.160> different<00:04:02.570> results<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.350> same

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
three different results in of the same

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.390 
three different results in of the same
track<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.540> make<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.690> make<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.140> decision<00:04:07.680> what

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
track and make it make a decision what

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400 
track and make it make a decision what
might<00:04:08.640> be<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.850> best<00:04:09.180> way<00:04:09.330> for<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.140> I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
might be the best way for that and I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.780 
might be the best way for that and I
think<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:11.160> would<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.459> an<00:04:11.549> interesting

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
think this would be an interesting

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:25.850 
think this would be an interesting
project

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.919
