"Now I'm going to show you some of the tools
you'll want to use in face painting.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.700
We'll start with the brushes, you can buy
just any type of art brush, preferably ones

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.320
with synthetic bristles or real hair.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.131
And they should be able to easily brush back
and forth.

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:32.680
They come in varying sizes, this one's a 4,
which is one of the most universal sizes that

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:41.289
face painters use but then we have a 0 which
is a very fine tip brush and then they range

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.269
from very wide bristles to in-between.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.170
Next we have sponges.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.219
You will want to buy specifically face painting
sponges.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.129
You can find these on a variety of websites.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.889
Normally they come in a round, like this,
this is actually from the brand called Snazaroo

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:08.560
and what you can do then is cut them to make
little wedges.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.540
Next you will want to get FDA approved cosmetic
paints.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.050
These are meant to be used on the face.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:25.650
There are also other brands such as Krylon,
Ben Nye, Snazaroo but these are my favorites.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.220
They're activated just by water, which I use
a spray bottle for.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.000
Next we have a paint called an arty brush
and it has a variety of different colors next

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.280
to each other which make a perfect stroke
pattern and blend the colors perfectly together

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.930
so you don't have to.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:00.680
Next we have glitter and they come in 2 different
forms; liquid, which easily comes out in a

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:10.039
gel form, which you can draw lines with, make
dots.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:20.090
Next we have loose glitter and you just put
some on your finger and then just dab it over

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.310
the paint to make it glimmer.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.640
And then last but not least, how to remove
your face paint or to fix a mistake, baby

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.590
wipes are the easiest way or if there's any
slight staining of a color, warm water and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.950
mild soap will do the trick.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.950
