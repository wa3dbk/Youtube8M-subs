00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.910
 Welcome guys to this first video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.059
 of the long wars 92 series a as first 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.469
 opponent today we have yellow xy that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:20.160
 I'm inviting the game into this 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:23.820
 moment we wait for you to accept he will have to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.650
 use the Udine area as their own 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.430
 because yesterday and lazio I played against 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.710
 the Udinese 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.550
 so let's go immediately to do the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.530
 formations ok my form and how 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 always the 5 3 2 with marchetti in port 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.079
 with external right konko and like 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.239
 central defenders siani dias and radu e 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.370
 with left outer lulic 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.520
 the three midfielders will be candreva 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.450
 ledesma hernanes and the two klose tips 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 Ederson 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.690
 let's say it's just the same schilder 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.690
 real madrid but let's go straight to the field 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.950
 ok guys let's start right away from the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.700
 fourteenth minute and we can see 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.310
 that I just earned a punishment 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.310
 decided to let her kick a hernanes 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.390
 we see nothing a mozzarella launched by 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.940
 bear that we easily see now 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.990
 What happen 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 let's talk about the game a little bit 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.940
 ok let's take back the game immediately and 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:41.869
 we see that the Udine takes an action 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 dangerous that is a penalty kick give 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.069
 really in the meantime random you put 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.860
 your hands everywhere in your hair those who 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:54.350
 he knows that the penalty is the act 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.420
 scandalous for kids 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.220
 covering the replay see with the ball 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.120
 that player is your paradox 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.130
 not only do I not know why it is a cleaver 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.440
 the Udinese striker arrives 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.970
 the arbitrary core of wine and so the kicks 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.100
 of rigor hello confrontation made the Lazio 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.180
 is 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.740
 surely we will sue the referee 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.430
 but truly a scandalous thing ever 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.390
 seen such a rigor 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.250
 let's go directly to the other front 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 in the meantime with anderson who is 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.980
 gains the corner kick 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 Candreva 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 hernanes a bit of trick lasts a while 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.850
 players that and there is a tie 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.160
 just as well 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:51.920
 the prophet puts it inside 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 this is dedicated to the referee I believe but 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.240
 let's go straight to the 55th where 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.210
 gianluca really has two balls 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.040
 dangerous first with I don't know who and then 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.200
 after common is that with a half 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.780
 overturned he was about to throw it in but 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.959
 thank goodness there was marchetti and then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.940
 we pass the 66th directly with one 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.040
 great play always made by jean 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.410
 luc that with maicosuel dribla very well 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 the defender and pull a slingshot on 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.360
 first post 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.010
 obviously a nice goal now let's go 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.360
 forward with my counterattack with klose 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.450
 than on the band 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.730
 yes yes triple to benatia then return the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.600
 step behind for pineapple as always 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.050
 dribla case of rho at random and there is a goal 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.980
 cristian ledesma this great goal 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.380
 skills 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.300
 note that technique in the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:59.540
 do this very ugly and that's okay 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.540
 now we see the big game is what 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.790
 you pass the ball alone these are the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.590
 players that al alaqi meanwhile we give with 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.080
 the last action of the ball game 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.150
 klose that triple the defender and pull him 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.930
 scarpino in the door does not really see the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.510
 balloon and ends here 2 even beautiful 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.060
 I really play my players 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.530
 I don't know what to celebrate though, it's good 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.960
 so they are happy we are all happy 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.850
 I wanted to thank lux already for the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.490

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.389
