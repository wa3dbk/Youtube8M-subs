this membrane here as I mentioned in the
previous<00:01:50.790> video<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.660> smoked<00:01:51.900> rib

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
previous video here at smoked rib

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.190 
previous video here at smoked rib
mentioned<00:01:53.120> will<00:01:54.120> always<00:01:54.480> take<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.810> membrane

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
mentioned will always take this membrane

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.160 
mentioned will always take this membrane
off<00:01:58.130> we<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.120> take<00:02:01.020> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
off we don't like to have it take this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.950 
off we don't like to have it take this
off

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.780 

now<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.230> there's<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.430> coming

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
now you see there's the one more coming

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.219 
now you see there's the one more coming
my<00:02:08.880> big<00:02:09.060> cat<00:02:09.300> I'm<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.630> do<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.170> thing

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
my big cat I'm going to do on this thing

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
my big cat I'm going to do on this thing
I'm<00:02:10.920> choosing<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.670> after<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> take<00:02:12.210> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
I'm choosing to do it after I take the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.670 
I'm choosing to do it after I take the
membrane<00:02:12.630> off<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.020> figure<00:02:13.140> every<00:02:13.380> easier

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
membrane off and figure every easier

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.430 
membrane off and figure every easier
that<00:02:13.860> way<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.940> get<00:02:15.090> out<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.930> take<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.230> off

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that way to get out the to take this off

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.940 
that way to get out the to take this off
and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> cut<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> stay<00:02:19.440> will<00:02:19.650> stick

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and then do the cut so I stay will stick

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:29.490 
and then do the cut so I stay will stick
with<00:02:20.100> me<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.670> we'll<00:02:20.850> get<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.720 

you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.840 

all<00:02:37.730> right<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.210> have<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.420> membrane

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
all right so we have to membrane

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.000 
all right so we have to membrane
off<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.150> now<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.410> some<00:02:40.920> more

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
off now now I was going to do some more

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.370 
off now now I was going to do some more
trimming<00:02:41.400> off<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.990> before<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.290> do

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
trimming off of that but before we do

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.190 
trimming off of that but before we do
that<00:02:43.440> we're<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.980> actually<00:02:44.100> do<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:45.200> big

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
that we're going to actually do the big

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
that we're going to actually do the big
cut<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.770> remember<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.160> want<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:47.670> nice

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
cut here remember we want some nice

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
cut here remember we want some nice
sharp<00:02:48.060> knife<00:02:48.120> make<00:02:48.720> sure<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> kind<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.230> board

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
yourself so the first we want to do is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.760 
yourself so the first we want to do is
find<00:02:58.860> out<00:02:59.040> where<00:02:59.280> these<00:02:59.550> bones<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.680> can

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
find out where these bones as you can

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.310 
find out where these bones as you can
see<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:02.910> these<00:03:03.060> bones<00:03:03.300> right<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:03.780> find

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
see here all these bones right here find

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.350 
see here all these bones right here find
out<00:03:04.500> where<00:03:04.710> they<00:03:04.920> end<00:03:05.190> within<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.940> meat<00:03:06.120> here

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
out where they end within the meat here

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.460 
out where they end within the meat here
itself<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.320> they're<00:03:07.530> going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> end<00:03:08.750> right<00:03:09.750> add

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
itself so they're going to end right add

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.130 
itself so they're going to end right add
this<00:03:10.830> line<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.240> I'm<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.020> to

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
this line right here so I'm going to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870 
this line right here so I'm going to
maybe<00:03:13.440> pull<00:03:13.710> it<00:03:13.830> up<00:03:13.920> feel<00:03:14.250> with<00:03:14.400> your<00:03:14.520> finger

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
maybe pull it up feel with your finger

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.700 
maybe pull it up feel with your finger
and<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:15.420> put<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> knife<00:03:15.900> right<00:03:16.320> at<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
and just put the knife right at that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.070 
and just put the knife right at that
endpoint<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.720> might<00:03:18.840> draw

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
endpoint and then you might draw

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.120 
endpoint and then you might draw
imaginary<00:03:19.590> line<00:03:20.130> straight<00:03:20.520> across<00:03:20.550> here<00:03:21.240> and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
imaginary line straight across here and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.250 
imaginary line straight across here and
then<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.760> complete<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.210> cut<00:03:24.390> remember<00:03:25.140> one

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
then this complete the cut remember one

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.620 
then this complete the cut remember one
is<00:03:25.350> nice<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:26.490> as<00:03:26.580> nice<00:03:26.730> sharp<00:03:27.090> nice<00:03:27.300> for<00:03:27.570> all

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
is nice not as nice sharp nice for all
