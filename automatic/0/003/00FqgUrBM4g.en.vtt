/ crap now so well with this girly thing

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.130 
/ crap now so well with this girly thing
on<00:04:19.230> your<00:04:19.380> mouse<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.970> I'll<00:04:21.150> make<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.570> smaller<00:04:21.930> I

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
on your mouse so I'll make it smaller I

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.710

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
think that is about the same size as

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.620 
think that is about the same size as
that<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.380> can't<00:04:25.620> necessarily<00:04:26.540> put<00:04:27.540> them

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
that one you can't necessarily put them
