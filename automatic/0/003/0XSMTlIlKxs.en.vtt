00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.560 
dirt it wasn't like sitting on top and
it<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.950> grows<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:22.760> we've<00:04:23.120> been<00:04:23.210> doing<00:04:23.510> about

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
it just grows so we've been doing about

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.840 
it just grows so we've been doing about
with<00:04:23.810> everything<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.889> celery<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.610> seems<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.210> be

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
with everything of celery it seems to be

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.490 
with everything of celery it seems to be
it's<00:04:28.850> not<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.120> fastest<00:04:29.690> grower<00:04:29.930> but<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.380> can

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
it's not the fastest grower but you can

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.960 
it's not the fastest grower but you can
definitely<00:04:30.650> tell<00:04:31.010> pretty<00:04:31.310> instantly<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:31.820> see

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
definitely tell pretty instantly you see

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.110 
definitely tell pretty instantly you see
the<00:04:32.090> leaves<00:04:32.270> popping<00:04:32.840> up<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.260> think<00:04:34.120> that's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
the leaves popping up so I think that's

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.840 
the leaves popping up so I think that's
a<00:04:35.240> really<00:04:35.660> good<00:04:36.530> thing<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.800> do<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.730> don't

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
a really good thing to do and you don't

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.730 
a really good thing to do and you don't
need<00:04:38.060> any<00:04:38.240> space<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.540> do<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:39.140> I<00:04:39.200> highly

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
need any space to do it so I highly

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.640 
need any space to do it so I highly
suggest<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.370> if<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:40.990> eat<00:04:41.990> celery<00:04:42.290> at<00:04:42.530> all

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
suggest it if you eat celery at all

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.150 
suggest it if you eat celery at all
