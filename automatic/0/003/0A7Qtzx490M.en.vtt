00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.550
 and in fact she considers 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.510
 like first cd this year 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.720
 in fact the previous cd of our first true cd 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:17.019
 a lot of people did not participate so much because right-of-know students 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.079
 that we 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.730
 It was part of the group. Everything was ready. We already saw that we use the chosen ones. 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.880
 and we already had to get there and put the now people 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 we saw everything happen and we did not see the first song in a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.370
 meeting with henrique 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.980
 the ANA 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.390
 r so the people of the whole process of building the headquarters now 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.220
 it's being super fun now work account 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.110
 Thank you baby 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.280
 on here 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.739
 the city 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340
 here in Brazil I would love to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 nick santora without this rhythm now as happened with ragatanga 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.470
 For sure people will compare because I think it will pay 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.460
 testimony 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.890
 there was already an appeal 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.150
 For Brazil, making games. 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.700
 doing s 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 our attitude does not even 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.650
 went to sow the school agre 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.890
 I think that's what led to it. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 this new work 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.650
 the tietÃª 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.790
 evo 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.820
 five more mature girls are like this 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.590
 professionally speaking 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 and of real artists that we have become artists to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 From the moment we went to face a mission 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.230
 sure that energy is that people 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.340
 We have to continue 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.229
 or hire 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.979
 thus killing themselves to work with certainty the only answer Santista 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.110
 sometimes we have to lean somewhere 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.210
 and take the woman to walk on the left foot 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.080
 I think the thing that most makes me happy 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.510
 and make people happy 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.720
 in every way both our fans during the show told 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 is nutrition assistance to charities 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.279
 What saddens me the most 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.669
 are the criticisms of one's life practically of people who ignore 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.429
 know our work and criticize 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.119
 I think great and very valid people here 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.620
 make your reviews intense reviews 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.999
 since you know our work 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:31.159
 everyone has every right to like or dislike but knows one to be able to 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.019
 Say something is very sad sometimes I saw somebody 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.729
 talk like crazy has no calendar 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.049
 being that sometimes the person never any of us knows nor who is 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.019
 factory has its time is very sad because in the conversation with us 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 the leash makes the heart of all 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.589
 is the only way to improve 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.150
 are completely different realities but I was very happy I'm very happy 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.619
 of today 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.619
 You're a different joy that you can not compare. 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 here I sure thank you very much 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.369
 my family 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:12.320
 my parents 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.219
 does my grandmother had 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.539
 we suffered the beginning of the whole story she started 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.389
 to sing and so my mother after my aunt and then gave 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.409
 I thanked her for putting the song in my life. 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.619
 and mainly 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.069
 thanked God for the blessing that he 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.069
 I was so inwardly 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.749
 For everything that's been happening in my life. 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.189
 each day 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.849
 m 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.849
 I feel paulo 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.179
 a big difference from one day to the next 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.549
 how much I've been growing 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.549
 as a professional as his wife 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.179
 You have to thank my family a lot in the distance. 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.289
 as I can guarantee said the singer in being known has already been performed 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.039
 I think today my other goal 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.409
 is to stabilize 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.139
 d 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.509
 same team 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.969
 the hour 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.230
 grow with the group i built a 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.969
 in relation to Libya 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.800
 because 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 Everybody knows what it's all about. 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.610
 on here 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.460
 only with her 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.319
 It's a subject as well. 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.439
 deficient 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.870
 says the people I know 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.730
 today we can be 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.730
 The famous we're doing well that night can ride. 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740
 it is very unusual for unstable 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.319
 the cost for me today besides a job 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.550
 and my achievement 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.990
 as a professional 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.439
 It's my family where 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.450
 where do I go 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.469
 I'll look 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.949
 all I need 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.569
 and it's the only card of running points 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.569
 It was very sad in the early afternoon. 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.439
 my joys when about 4 6 thousand 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.990
 I wanted to cry 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.180
 this tension 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.490
 I only have class 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.099
 the yo-yo 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:20.740
 now
