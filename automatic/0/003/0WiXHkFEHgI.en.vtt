bulky fun stuff there we go and this is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.799 
bulky fun stuff there we go and this is
a<00:00:51.690> plastic<00:00:52.020> stand<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.949> put<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> in

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
a plastic stand that you can put it in

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
a plastic stand that you can put it in
so<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.079> pretty<00:00:55.289> cool

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.150 

it<00:00:58.680> comes<00:00:58.949> with<00:01:00.140> obviously<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.440> manual<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it comes with obviously a manual if you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
it comes with obviously a manual if you
really<00:01:02.520> need<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.210> external<00:01:03.510> hard

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
really need it it's an external hard

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.000 
really need it it's an external hard
drive<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.350> probably<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
drive so it's probably not that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.399 
drive so it's probably not that
complicated

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
complicated

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.600 
complicated
well<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.130> pretty<00:01:08.340> small

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
well as you can see it's pretty small

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
well as you can see it's pretty small
and<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> comes<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:09.900> languages

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and it comes with all these languages

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.520 
and it comes with all these languages
and<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.220> being<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> small<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.350> probably<00:01:13.350> has

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and for being that small it probably has

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.580 
and for being that small it probably has
like<00:01:13.680> two<00:01:13.890> pages<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> read<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.590> don't

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
like two pages for you to read I don't

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.320 
like two pages for you to read I don't
know<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.049> comes<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.740> USB<00:01:19.979> cord

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.210 

which<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.509> should<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> would<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> helpful

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.859 

so<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.340> simple<00:01:29.850> black<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:32.479> let's<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so I'm simple black and let's take a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
so I'm simple black and let's take a
look<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
look at it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.000 
look at it
itself<00:01:37.970> nice<00:01:38.970> foam<00:01:39.930> protection<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.830> either

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
itself nice foam protection on either

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.600 
itself nice foam protection on either
side<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:45.390> feels<00:01:45.659> cold<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.100> metal

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
side and it feels cold so that is metal

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
side and it feels cold so that is metal
for<00:01:47.820> sure<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.440> texture<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
for sure I really like the texture of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
for sure I really like the texture of
this<00:01:50.100> actually<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:51.210> quite<00:01:51.450> nice<00:01:53.210> especially

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this actually it's quite nice especially

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850 
this actually it's quite nice especially
if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.690> Mac<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.170> blends<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.830> quite

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
if you have a Mac it blends in quite

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.280 
if you have a Mac it blends in quite
well<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.340> their<00:01:57.049> design<00:01:58.049> aesthetics

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
well with their design aesthetics

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.389 
well with their design aesthetics
although<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.440> did<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.860> keep<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.280> on

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
although they did kind of keep it out on

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.820 
although they did kind of keep it out on
the<00:02:02.490> endcaps<00:02:02.940> they're<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:04.110> plastic<00:02:04.590> that's

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
the endcaps they're just plastic that's

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.680 
the endcaps they're just plastic that's
painted<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.479> looks<00:02:06.630> pretty

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
painted but it actually looks pretty

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.249 
painted but it actually looks pretty
good<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.470> too<00:02:07.649> bad<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.170> have

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
good it's not too bad and then you have

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.130 
good it's not too bad and then you have
your<00:02:10.410> power<00:02:11.100> switch<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.550> here<00:02:12.140> simple

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
your power switch right here simple

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.430 
your power switch right here simple
enough<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.620> your<00:02:14.220> USB<00:02:14.700> input<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.300> AC<00:02:15.870> adapter

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
enough and your USB input and AC adapter

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.110 
enough and your USB input and AC adapter
and<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.310> looks<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> Kensington

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and it looks like they have a Kensington

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600 
and it looks like they have a Kensington
lock<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.190> don't<00:02:20.340> want<00:02:20.459> people

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
lock so if you don't want people

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.370 
lock so if you don't want people
stealing<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.150> data<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.900> could<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.260> lock

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
stealing your data you could just lock

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.160 
stealing your data you could just lock
it<00:02:22.560> down<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.920> desk<00:02:23.750> let's<00:02:24.750> take<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> look

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it down to your desk let's take a look

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.740 
it down to your desk let's take a look
at<00:02:25.290> what<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.800> looks<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.420> stand

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
at what it looks like in the stand

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.890 
at what it looks like in the stand
pretty<00:02:30.750> simple<00:02:36.290> looks<00:02:37.290> quite<00:02:37.560> nice<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:38.900> believe

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
pretty simple looks quite nice I believe

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.199 
pretty simple looks quite nice I believe
it<00:02:40.260> comes<00:02:40.530> formatted<00:02:41.370> by<00:02:41.519> default

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
it comes formatted by default

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.020 
it comes formatted by default
NTFS<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> Mac<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.670> need<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
NTFS so if you have a Mac you need a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.319 
NTFS so if you have a Mac you need a
reformat<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.720> into<00:02:46.230> something<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.890> can

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
reformat it into something that it can

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.390 
reformat it into something that it can
write<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.660> think<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.140> Mac<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.500> read<00:02:49.739> NTFS

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
write to I think the Mac can read NTFS

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.750 
write to I think the Mac can read NTFS
but<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.670> can't<00:02:50.880> write<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.680> yeah<00:02:52.890> that's<00:02:53.250> kind

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
but it can't write so yeah that's kind

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270 
but it can't write so yeah that's kind
of<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> problem<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.329> really<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:55.110> NTFS<00:02:55.799> but<00:02:56.070> the
