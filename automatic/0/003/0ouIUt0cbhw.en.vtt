00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
duplicate that gets into a big hassle of

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.590 
duplicate that gets into a big hassle of
having<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.680> explain<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.180> rather<00:01:12.420> than

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
having to explain it so rather than

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
having to explain it so rather than
dealing<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.259> I<00:01:13.320> always<00:01:13.829> rename<00:01:14.219> the

dealing with that I always rename the
final<00:01:14.939> images<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.329> can<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.509> delivered<00:01:15.750> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
one of these it's going to give me an

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.649 
one of these it's going to give me an
option<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.109> do<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> custom<00:01:40.950> name<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> X<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.630> Y

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
option to do a custom name and of X of Y

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.170 
option to do a custom name and of X of Y
and<00:01:42.840> based<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> starting<00:01:44.159> number<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:45.000> what

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and based on a starting number so what

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.899 
and based on a starting number so what
we'll<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.420> we'll<00:01:45.539> type<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.899> s<00:01:46.079> our<00:01:46.259> lounge

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
we'll do is we'll type in s our lounge

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.859 
we'll do is we'll type in s our lounge
final<00:01:47.990> images<00:01:48.990> i<00:01:50.149> will<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.299> tutorial<00:01:51.780> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
final images i will put tutorial in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.770 
final images i will put tutorial in
there<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.320> why<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.799> oriole<00:01:53.780> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there that's why I'm just at oriole and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.139 
there that's why I'm just at oriole and
you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.740> how<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.979> does<00:01:56.100> X<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.520> Y<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you can see how it does X of Y one of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
you can see how it does X of Y one of
sixteen<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.810> it'll<00:01:57.960> base<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.289> be<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.679> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sixteen so it'll base would be one of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
sixteen so it'll base would be one of
however<00:01:59.490> many<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.969> being<00:02:00.179> exported<00:02:00.570> or

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
however many are being exported or

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.859 
however many are being exported or
however<00:02:01.079> many<00:02:01.259> being<00:02:01.590> renamed<00:02:02.299> this<00:02:03.299> original

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
however many being renamed this original

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.029 
however many being renamed this original
file<00:02:04.079> number<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> keep<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
file number is just going to keep the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.499 
file number is just going to keep the
original<00:02:05.310> file<00:02:05.460> which<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.359> to<00:02:06.420> do

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
original file which we don't want to do

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
original file which we don't want to do
because<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.020> want<00:02:07.560> again<00:02:07.859> I<00:02:07.920> wanted<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
because I want again I wanted to be

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.680 
because I want again I wanted to be
remembered<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.210> they<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.420> come

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
remembered so that they don't come

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.410 
remembered so that they don't come
asking<00:02:09.899> me<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.410> questions<00:02:10.470> later<00:02:11.070> on

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
asking me all these questions later on

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.790 
asking me all these questions later on
then<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.600> custom<00:02:12.990> names<00:02:13.170> sequence<00:02:13.620> this

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
then we have custom names sequence this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.410 
then we have custom names sequence this
is<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> typically<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.610> i<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.000> customized

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
is what I typically do i do a customized

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.520 
is what I typically do i do a customized
sequence<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.900> i<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.080> little<00:02:16.230> modification

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
sequence and i do a little modification

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.490 
sequence and i do a little modification
on<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.450> then<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.629> custom<00:02:19.050> name<00:02:19.260> which

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
on it then we have custom name which

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.899 
on it then we have custom name which
just<00:02:19.709> gives<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.190> custom<00:02:20.489> name<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
just gives it a custom name but it

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:21.950 
just gives it a custom name but it
doesn't<00:02:21.180> give<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> number

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
doesn't give it a number

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600 
doesn't give it a number
I<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.830> either<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.460> it's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
I don't like that either because it's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.190 
I don't like that either because it's
going<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.760> use<00:02:24.060> Windows<00:02:24.450> basically<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.900> create

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
going to use Windows basically to create

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.330 
going to use Windows basically to create
multiple<00:02:25.680> numbers<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:28.100> next<00:02:29.100> we<00:02:29.220> have

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
multiple numbers for it next we have

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.210 
multiple numbers for it next we have
date<00:02:29.640> file<00:02:29.970> name<00:02:30.650> which<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.740> don't<00:02:31.800> want<00:02:32.070> it's

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
date file name which I don't want it's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.740 
date file name which I don't want it's
not<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:32.550> friendly<00:02:32.730> format<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.480> next<00:02:33.690> we

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
not a very friendly format the next we

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.260 
not a very friendly format the next we
have<00:02:33.840> filename<00:02:34.470> sequence<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.150> also

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
have filename sequence and then we also

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.920 
have filename sequence and then we also
have<00:02:36.390> file<00:02:36.780> name<00:02:37.370> now<00:02:38.370> i<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:39.330> edit<00:02:39.480> any<00:02:39.660> one<00:02:39.900> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
have file name now i can edit any one of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.350 
have file name now i can edit any one of
these<00:02:40.050> by<00:02:40.260> selecting<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> preset<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.270> i'm

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
these by selecting like a preset so i'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.640 
these by selecting like a preset so i'm
gonna<00:02:42.450> select<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.780> custom-made<00:02:43.200> sequence

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
gonna select this custom-made sequence

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.080 
gonna select this custom-made sequence
because<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.130> closest<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:44.700> i<00:02:44.760> want

and then i'm going to go under edit and
what<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.630> does<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.780> basically<00:02:49.080> shows<00:02:49.530> me<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
what it does is basically shows me the

I<00:03:11.160> need<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.430> add<00:03:11.550> at<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.820> beginning<00:03:12.120> okay<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
I need to add at the beginning okay and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.120 
I need to add at the beginning okay and
it's<00:03:13.080> going<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.260> show<00:03:13.440> basically<00:03:13.680> how<00:03:13.950> it's

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
it's going to show basically how it's

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.830 
it's going to show basically how it's
going<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.280> look<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:15.300> don't<00:03:15.540> want<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.720> do

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
going to look now I don't want to do

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.570 
going to look now I don't want to do
that<00:03:15.870> basically<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.590> mean<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.370> thing<00:03:17.550> is

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
that basically I mean this thing is

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.580 
that basically I mean this thing is
pretty<00:03:18.060> self-explanatory<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.350> far<00:03:19.500> as

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
pretty self-explanatory as far as

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800 
pretty self-explanatory as far as
changing<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.880> what<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> want<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.720> do

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
changing it so what I want to do

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.090 
changing it so what I want to do
actually<00:03:22.140> let<00:03:22.230> me<00:03:22.290> cancel<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.710> out<00:03:22.920> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
actually let me cancel this out and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.270 
actually let me cancel this out and
we're<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.400> click<00:03:23.760> Edit<00:03:24.030> again<00:03:25.220> all<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
we're going to click Edit again all I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400 
we're going to click Edit again all I
want<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> custom<00:03:28.170> text

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
want it to be is just the custom text

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
want it to be is just the custom text
i'm<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.800> type<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.460> then<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.670> sequence

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
i'm going to type in and then a sequence

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
i'm going to type in and then a sequence
starting<00:03:30.840> with<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.290> i<00:03:31.440> want<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.710> be<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.860> 4

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
starting with and i want to be a 4

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.980 
starting with and i want to be a 4
number<00:03:32.340> sequence<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.360> i<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.600> change<00:03:33.840> that

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
number sequence so i can change that

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.750 
number sequence so i can change that
sequence<00:03:34.440> number<00:03:34.740> by<00:03:34.860> either<00:03:35.010> clicking<00:03:35.220> here

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
sequence number by either clicking here

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.610 
sequence number by either clicking here
and<00:03:35.790> selecting<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.630> different<00:03:36.660> amount<00:03:37.440> of

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
and selecting a different amount of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.710 
and selecting a different amount of
numbers<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.730> if<00:03:38.760> i<00:03:38.910> select<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.300> 5<00:03:39.480> number

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
numbers so if i select a 5 number

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.390 
numbers so if i select a 5 number
sequence<00:03:40.080> it'll<00:03:40.290> start<00:03:40.500> with<00:03:40.620> zeros<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.220> then

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
sequence it'll start with zeros and then

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.250 
sequence it'll start with zeros and then
you<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.820> fill<00:03:42.030> up<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.420> numbers<00:03:42.660> go<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:43.020> I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
you know fill up as the numbers go up I

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.550 
you know fill up as the numbers go up I
want<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> 4<00:03:44.520> number<00:03:44.730> sequence<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
want to be a 4 number sequence the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040 
want to be a 4 number sequence the
reason<00:03:46.800> why<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.950> do<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.340> also<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:48.090> because<00:03:48.480> we

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
reason why I do this also is because we

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.290 
reason why I do this also is because we
actually<00:03:49.200> upload<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.100> pick<00:03:50.610> Tosh<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.180> like

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
actually upload to pick Tosh and like

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.800 
actually upload to pick Tosh and like
what<00:03:51.450> if<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.840> upload<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.290> online<00:03:52.710> sources

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
what if you upload to online sources

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.090 
what if you upload to online sources
they<00:03:54.810> typically<00:03:55.170> want<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.680> have<00:03:55.860> like

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
they typically want you to have like

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300 
they typically want you to have like
four<00:03:56.720> numbers<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.990> file<00:03:58.200> name<00:03:58.470> because

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
four numbers in the file name because

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
four numbers in the file name because
they<00:03:59.520> use<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.940> for<00:04:00.150> sorting<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:00.870> if

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
they use that for sorting so like if

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.540 
they use that for sorting so like if
it's<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.350> one<00:04:01.680> two<00:04:01.890> three<00:04:02.100> four<00:04:02.250> five<00:04:02.280> six

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
it's just one two three four five six

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.180 
it's just one two three four five six
seven<00:04:02.670> eight<00:04:02.790> nine<00:04:02.850> ten<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.750> can<00:04:03.930> get<00:04:04.190> the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
seven eight nine ten you can get the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.830 
seven eight nine ten you can get the
computer<00:04:05.430> system<00:04:05.760> will<00:04:05.850> actually<00:04:06.090> not<00:04:06.300> sort

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
computer system will actually not sort

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.170 
computer system will actually not sort
it<00:04:06.900> correctly<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.740> you<00:04:08.490> need<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.700> do<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:09.150> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
it correctly so you need to do like a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.240 
it correctly so you need to do like a
four<00:04:09.540> number<00:04:09.810> system<00:04:10.140> now<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.710> didn't<00:04:11.070> want<00:04:11.220> it

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
four number system now I didn't want it

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.040 
four number system now I didn't want it
to<00:04:11.310> add<00:04:11.520> on<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.970> sequence<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.870> end<00:04:12.990> of

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
to add on the sequence on to the end of

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.270 
to add on the sequence on to the end of
it<00:04:13.140> because<00:04:13.350> we<00:04:13.440> see<00:04:13.620> what<00:04:13.770> it's<00:04:13.890> doing<00:04:13.920> is

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
it because we see what it's doing is

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.800 
it because we see what it's doing is
it's<00:04:14.460> putting<00:04:14.610> sequence<00:04:15.150> which<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.480> have<00:04:15.570> one

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
it's putting sequence which we have one

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.750 
it's putting sequence which we have one
and<00:04:16.109> then<00:04:16.200> it's<00:04:16.320> adding<00:04:16.560> another<00:04:16.770> sequence<00:04:17.190> 00

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
and then it's adding another sequence 00

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.789 
and then it's adding another sequence 00
01<00:04:18.020> on<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.230> end<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.440> I'm<00:04:19.530> going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.710> delete

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
01 on the end so I'm going to delete

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.520 
01 on the end so I'm going to delete
that<00:04:20.270> what<00:04:21.270> i<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.480> do<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.630> if<00:04:21.930> i<00:04:22.020> click<00:04:22.290> right

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
that what i can do is if i click right

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.620 
that what i can do is if i click right
here<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.610> sequence<00:04:24.120> it'll<00:04:24.540> actually

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
here on this sequence it'll actually

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.390 
here on this sequence it'll actually
give<00:04:24.840> me<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.050> option<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:26.040> change<00:04:26.280> that

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
give me the option to just change that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.250 
give me the option to just change that
to<00:04:26.670> modify<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.120> right<00:04:27.270> there<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:28.080> I'm<00:04:28.140> just

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
to modify it right there so I'm just

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.610 
to modify it right there so I'm just
going<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.440> change<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:29.010> 0<00:04:29.430> 0<00:04:29.670> 0<00:04:29.700> 1<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:31.500> now

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
going to change this to 0 0 0 1 and now

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.410 
going to change this to 0 0 0 1 and now
we<00:04:31.680> have<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.010> 4<00:04:32.520> number

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
we have a 4 number

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.540 
we have a 4 number
once<00:04:33.660> starting<00:04:34.530> with<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.890> sequence<00:04:35.220> number

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
once starting with the sequence number

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.180 
once starting with the sequence number
that<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.760> enter<00:04:36.060> in<00:04:36.210> I'm<00:04:36.780> go<00:04:36.870> ahead<00:04:37.050> done<00:04:37.290> so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
that I enter in I'm go ahead done so

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.400 
that I enter in I'm go ahead done so
that's<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.520> typical<00:04:38.930> rename<00:04:39.930> setting<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.320> I

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
that's the typical rename setting that I

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.990
