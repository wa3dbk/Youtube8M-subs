 and is that they naturally find out 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:15.939
 if you believe in something 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.679
 if you trust in the importance of developments 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.460
 if you know what you want 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 then the difficulties they find savage 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.880
 strengthened with the setbacks 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 ends up overcoming the barriers that hinder 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.040
 with this strategy 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 the interest in the ice of the glaciers 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.280
 with technical schools not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580
 of inside that these

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.290
 this attraction for the classic tests that conquers this great 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.920
 internationally recognized scenario for its complex and risky

 in 1996 it appeared 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910
 with a tremendous desire to contribute their mathematical knowledge 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 something practical 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.740
 from the 27 to the year 2000 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.060
 beginning to develop what they had in mind 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.440
 the special environment 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.850
 these times 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 still not talking about global warming 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.160
 after staff 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.140
 self-financed love looking for sponsor that is that this is some material 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.229
 they did not have adequate equipment to work in the open for long periods 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.980
 but they could count on the probing 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.420
 official sources 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.300
 in 2006, a qualitative change 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.280
 they are invited by the Russians apart

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.350
 I was very interested in the work that both researchers did and they wanted 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.890
 let's come 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 after downloading the fia if I want to lose information 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.939
 interest awakened in the sky the Russians 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.769
 with the data recorded during those first years 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.289
 they began to consume 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.349
 so in 2001 he started what they called an error 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 national supports international collaborations 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.259
 they started to create the network of leg stations 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.229
 located in polar areas of the two hemispheres 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.229
 and that they measure in continuing with their career 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 the one that was consolidated 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.519
 and now in 2010 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.519
 a new stage with iu 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.219
 since the beginning of the project was approved 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.219
 not only is researched 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.669
 global warming 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 they have not become fashionable

 lucas luna new stage 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.859
 behind was the time 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.099
 and there is a solid 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.239
 that nobody after decades of work then continue
