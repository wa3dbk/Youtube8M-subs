00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
now and he's very aware of those

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 
now and he's very aware of those
pressures<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.920> teaches<00:02:05.250> them<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.430> deal

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
pressures and so it teaches them to deal

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.160 
pressures and so it teaches them to deal
with<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.510> able<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> cope<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
with that and to be able to cope with it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.010 
with that and to be able to cope with it
and<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> second<00:02:08.280> thing<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.759> does<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.479> helps

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and the second thing it does is it helps

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.380 
and the second thing it does is it helps
them<00:02:10.259> take<00:02:10.649> care<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.250> any<00:02:11.700> issues<00:02:11.790> they<00:02:12.360> have

caused a lot of heartache for them

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
caused a lot of heartache for them
they're<00:02:23.880> able<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.270> address<00:02:24.540> those<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.430> accept

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
they don't have to live with the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.160 
they don't have to live with the
negative<00:02:32.460> emotion<00:02:33.240> day-to-day<00:02:33.630> from<00:02:34.020> their

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
negative emotion day-to-day from their

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.080 
negative emotion day-to-day from their
past<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:34.740> can<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.130> free<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
past that they can be free from that and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.270 
past that they can be free from that and
that's<00:02:36.240> what<00:02:36.420> Jesus<00:02:36.570> came<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.160> them

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that's what Jesus came for is for them

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.280 
that's what Jesus came for is for them
to<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.520> free<00:02:38.730> from<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.090> after<00:02:39.930> those<00:02:40.080> first

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to be free from that after those first

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.260 
to be free from that after those first
two<00:02:40.500> lessons<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:41.040> pick<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.580> Titus<00:02:42.000> too

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
two lessons we pick up with Titus too

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.690 
two lessons we pick up with Titus too
because<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.350> are<00:02:43.470> seven<00:02:43.890> key<00:02:44.100> principles

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
because there are seven key principles

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.460 
because there are seven key principles
right<00:02:44.970> from<00:02:45.209> Titus<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> think<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
right from Titus to I think it's the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.550 
right from Titus to I think it's the
most<00:02:47.090> condensed<00:02:48.090> part<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.959> scriptures

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
most condensed part of scriptures

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.580 
most condensed part of scriptures
specifically<00:02:50.490> meant<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:50.910> women<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.690> find<00:02:52.470> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
specifically meant for women I find it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.380 
specifically meant for women I find it
interesting<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:53.130> when<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.490> was<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.850> young

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
interesting that when I was a young

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.780 
interesting that when I was a young
woman<00:02:54.720> myself<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> brand<00:02:56.100> new<00:02:56.280> Christian

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
woman myself I was a brand new Christian

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.050 
woman myself I was a brand new Christian

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and I wanted desperately to know how to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.660 
and I wanted desperately to know how to
be<00:03:00.420> what<00:03:01.170> God<00:03:01.350> wanted<00:03:01.709> me<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:02.070> as<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.490> matter
