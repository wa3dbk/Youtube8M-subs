along with you know the main issue which

along with you know the main issue which
was<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:42.220> dog<00:00:42.460> bone<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.120> not<00:00:43.299> being<00:00:43.510> long

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
was the dog bone and it not being long

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.590 
was the dog bone and it not being long
enough<00:00:44.080> but<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:45.280> more<00:00:45.489> I<00:00:45.519> start<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.940> look<00:00:46.269> into

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
enough but the more I start to look into

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.090 
enough but the more I start to look into
it<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.110> more<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.350> thought<00:00:47.530> about<00:00:47.589> it<00:00:47.860> I

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
it and the more I thought about it I

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.310 
it and the more I thought about it I
remember<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:48.699> when<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.059> was<00:00:49.330> first<00:00:49.570> to

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
remember that when this was first to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.100 
remember that when this was first to
come<00:00:50.500> out<00:00:50.739> they<00:00:51.670> had<00:00:51.909> the<00:00:52.150> release<00:00:52.479> date<00:00:52.720> set

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
come out they had the release date set

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.310 
come out they had the release date set
and<00:00:53.350> then<00:00:54.010> when<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.339> did<00:00:54.580> come<00:00:54.610> out<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:56.170> was

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
and then when it did come out it was

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.109 
and then when it did come out it was
only<00:00:56.559> available<00:00:56.650> for<00:00:57.070> like<00:00:57.220> a<00:00:57.250> week<00:00:57.519> or<00:00:57.760> two

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
only available for like a week or two

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.689 
only available for like a week or two
and<00:00:58.360> then<00:00:58.479> you<00:00:58.629> couldn't<00:00:58.930> get<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.290> for<00:00:59.739> you

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
and then you couldn't get it for you

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.310 
and then you couldn't get it for you
know<00:01:00.790> another<00:01:00.970> couple<00:01:01.449> months<00:01:01.869> two<00:01:02.049> or<00:01:02.170> three

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
know another couple months two or three

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.120 
know another couple months two or three
months<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.699> I<00:01:03.729> start<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.089> think<00:01:04.150> maybe<00:01:05.130> they

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
months so I start to think maybe they

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.819 
months so I start to think maybe they
recalled<00:01:06.579> it<00:01:06.789> and<00:01:07.229> nobody<00:01:08.229> had<00:01:08.380> actually

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
recalled it and nobody had actually

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.770 
recalled it and nobody had actually
talked<00:01:09.640> about<00:01:10.000> whether<00:01:10.210> or<00:01:10.299> not<00:01:10.420> they<00:01:10.630> ever

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
talked about whether or not they ever

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.179 
talked about whether or not they ever
called<00:01:11.109> there<00:01:11.289> or<00:01:11.439> if<00:01:11.530> they<00:01:11.680> have<00:01:11.799> resolved

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
called there or if they have resolved

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.429 
called there or if they have resolved
the<00:01:12.340> issues<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.909> dog<00:01:13.090> bone<00:01:13.329> so<00:01:13.659> what<00:01:14.350> I'm

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
the issues with a dog bone so what I'm

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.859 
the issues with a dog bone so what I'm
going<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.649> do<00:01:14.859> is<00:01:15.070> show<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.369> that<00:01:15.939> in<00:01:16.719> my

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
going to do is show you that in my

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.840 
going to do is show you that in my
opinion<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:17.229> think<00:01:17.259> they<00:01:17.500> did<00:01:17.710> actually<00:01:17.950> recall

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
opinion I think they did actually recall

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.690 
opinion I think they did actually recall
it<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.299> just<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.140> show<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.380> guys<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
it and just to show you guys that the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.120 
it and just to show you guys that the
issue<00:01:21.880> with<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.359> dog<00:01:22.509> bone<00:01:22.810> doesn't<00:01:23.710> seem<00:01:24.009> to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
issue with the dog bone doesn't seem to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.849 
issue with the dog bone doesn't seem to
be<00:01:24.280> one<00:01:24.460> anymore<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.420> just<00:01:26.350> let<00:01:26.439> me<00:01:26.469> position

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
be one anymore so just let me position

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.859 
be one anymore so just let me position
this<00:01:27.219> and<00:01:27.369> then<00:01:27.460> i'll<00:01:27.490> show<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:27.820> what<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.719> dog

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
this and then i'll show you what the dog

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.200 
this and then i'll show you what the dog
bones<00:01:29.170> look<00:01:29.350> like<00:01:29.500> in<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.710> front<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.969> as<00:01:31.119> you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
bones look like in the front so as you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.149 
bones look like in the front so as you
can<00:01:31.329> see<00:01:31.509> here<00:01:31.719> this<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.200> front<00:01:32.469> dog<00:01:32.679> bone<00:01:32.920> it

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
can see here this is a front dog bone it

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.469 
can see here this is a front dog bone it
is<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.549> is<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:36.189> this<00:01:36.280> extension<00:01:36.729> I'm

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
is that is for this extension I'm

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.899 
is that is for this extension I'm
holding<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:38.020> up<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.320> obviously<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.460> spring<00:01:39.759> is

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
holding it up so obviously the spring is

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.880 
holding it up so obviously the spring is
pushing<00:01:40.689> all<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.840> way<00:01:41.020> down<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:41.530> that's<00:01:41.619> it's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
pushing all the way down so that's it's

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.539 
pushing all the way down so that's it's
for<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.249> compression<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:43.179> as<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.140> can<00:01:44.259> see

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
for this compression and as you can see

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.440 
for this compression and as you can see
it<00:01:45.549> no<00:01:45.789> longer<00:01:47.399> sits<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.579> right<00:01:48.819> on<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.060> edge<00:01:49.179> I

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
it no longer sits on right on the edge I

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.149 
it no longer sits on right on the edge I
mean<00:01:49.630> they<00:01:50.079> could<00:01:50.109> have<00:01:50.319> pushed<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.859> just<00:01:51.069> a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
mean they could have pushed it in just a

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.300 
mean they could have pushed it in just a
little<00:01:51.310> bit<00:01:51.429> more<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.179> I<00:01:52.659> mean<00:01:53.619> it's<00:01:53.829> in<00:01:54.100> there

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
little bit more but I mean it's in there

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.370 
little bit more but I mean it's in there
and<00:01:54.549> then<00:01:55.149> on<00:01:55.270> compression<00:01:55.630> obviously<00:01:56.200> it's

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
and then on compression obviously it's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.029 
and then on compression obviously it's
moves<00:01:57.009> in<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.219> little<00:01:57.429> bit<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:58.329> it<00:01:58.420> looks<00:01:58.600> like

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
moves in a little bit so it looks like

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.819 
moves in a little bit so it looks like
they<00:02:00.039> heard<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:01.450> complaints<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.170> responded

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
they heard the complaints and responded
