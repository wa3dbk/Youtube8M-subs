00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.730
 we have an appointment with Jeremy Ferrari 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.059
 ugliness his lodge he waits for us then was 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.059
 two months 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.710
 good there are strong beautiful days with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 impression 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 hello I managed it hard it's okay 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.930
 fine and rather did not come here 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.650
 tonight because we were told that your 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.750
 show 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.989
 allelujah brothel it was solid cardboard on 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.809
 can do that of our own defenses 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:46.470
 with it works well it's very hard 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.750
 in the one man it's not obvious is this 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.370
 that you have, like religion, of course 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.690
 deferring my name provokes but it proves 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.400
 that people are open -minded 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.019
 smart allelujah brothel then 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.010
 why go wet at bornel go 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.180
 the devil because nobody is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.100
 to write it nobody knows how the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.379
 to pronounce and it hurts 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 by the way I'm going to match and suddenly I 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.800
 I misspelled on purpose 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.550
 his poster then that's a little twinkle 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 but you see what's funny 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.070
 it's that I do not have to spell it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.180
 people realized 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840
 because I kind of people got 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 describes the queen and especially when you're there 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 it's hard to get on stage 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 but it's all the more complicated 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.140
 to go on stage when you go there 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.789
 saying crap you to tell you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 the truth that things I could have 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.549
 take that was worse than I 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.140
 tells on stage that I did not take 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.090
 because the interpretations deferred 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 because according to the translations of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.359
 seagulls is not the same I do not take 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.229
 I took when things on 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.280
 which one can not really 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.960
 contradict the blow you still have 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 studied the subject of the coup we thought the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.710
 bible quran the doran a great respect of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.750
 faith and believers 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.700
 I went to see the ravine loans 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.110
 to be something I remember that I 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 shows you the extremists so the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.640
 extremists also use the facts 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.070
 it's a tradition in this profession 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.929
 says that the first five minutes a 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.460
 show are the most important have 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.500
 been more than that we shift before that are 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.870
 those first five minutes that determines 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.870
 all the atmosphere of lassus and stadium 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.280
 chances on my side 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:47.010
 cartel agreement flora and pretty success 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 media tell you I will provide it know 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.530
 I regretted the ardennes 20 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.640
 minutes later you arrive at marcq already 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.739
 a work solution 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.569
 Saffron is obvious that I am very 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.430
 young and I have no blues I 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.359
 stopped school in second bac as a 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.920

 Direct auto shop it goes very fast it is 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.120

 I was really amused and still 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.060
 once it's a pleasure to come back one 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.690
 little bit in Paris because it's not 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.430

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.310
 that I do that leave us in paris and I 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.379
 do not know what I feel like 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.450
