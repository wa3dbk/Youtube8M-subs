00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
something and it was just it it was a

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.369

good time and that's what I think that I
should<00:04:13.859> kind<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.519> go<00:04:14.579> back<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:14.879> its<00:04:15.269> kind<00:04:15.389> of

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
should kind of go back to its kind of

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.240 
should kind of go back to its kind of
hard<00:04:15.750> once<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.199> start<00:04:16.530> getting<00:04:16.680> into<00:04:16.949> this

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
hard once you start getting into this

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.800 
hard once you start getting into this
where<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.060> get<00:04:18.209> into<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.449> mindset

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
where you just you get into this mindset

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.360 
where you just you get into this mindset
we're<00:04:19.019> like<00:04:19.199> I<00:04:19.320> have<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.650> get<00:04:19.769> game<00:04:19.919> plays<00:04:20.190> and

some some good old friends it was fun
and<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:25.979> look<00:04:26.219> back<00:04:26.490> during<00:04:26.880> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and I look back during the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.600 
and I look back during the
like<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.570> whole<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.199> whole<00:04:28.530> domination<00:04:29.370> game<00:04:29.400> I

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
like a whole a whole domination game I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.610 
like a whole a whole domination game I
was<00:04:29.910> we<00:04:30.210> were<00:04:30.240> playing<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.810> looked<00:04:31.110> back<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.350> I

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
was we were playing I looked back and I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.560 
was we were playing I looked back and I
didn't<00:04:31.860> remember<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:32.550> single<00:04:32.910> thing<00:04:33.090> about<00:04:33.360> the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
didn't remember a single thing about the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.409 
didn't remember a single thing about the
game<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.560> was<00:04:34.680> like<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.460> know<00:04:35.580> it's<00:04:35.880> at<00:04:36.240> how

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
game so I was like you know it's at how

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.050 
game so I was like you know it's at how
gaming<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.289> think<00:04:37.770> should<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.340> where<00:04:38.610> were<00:04:38.910> you

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
gaming I think should be where were you

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.210 
gaming I think should be where were you
just<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.840> gaming<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.530> just<00:04:40.770> something<00:04:40.949> in<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
just the gaming is just something in the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.189 
just the gaming is just something in the
background<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.820> have<00:04:42.030> just<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.840> pass<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.050> time

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
background to have just to pass the time

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.920 
background to have just to pass the time
but<00:04:43.800> it's<00:04:44.639> it<00:04:45.000> should<00:04:45.270> be<00:04:45.419> more<00:04:45.630> about

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
but it's it should be more about

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.650 
but it's it should be more about
socializing<00:04:46.710> with<00:04:46.919> your<00:04:47.130> friends<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.759> just

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
socializing with your friends and just

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
you're gonna do it too because there's

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.480 
you're gonna do it too because there's
no<00:07:27.940> way<00:07:28.060> to<00:07:28.120> compete<00:07:28.600> and<00:07:28.979> it<00:07:29.979> just<00:07:30.160> it's<00:07:30.310> going

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
no way to compete and it just it's going

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.920

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
using steroids not using these things

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.550

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.300 
at the same time it's cool to see what

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.790 
at the same time it's cool to see what
you<00:07:43.389> can<00:07:43.539> get<00:07:43.720> with<00:07:43.900> these<00:07:43.990> full<00:07:44.229> parties<00:07:44.560> like

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060 
get I still think that this is really

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.820 
get I still think that this is really
entertaining<00:07:49.599> to<00:07:49.810> watch<00:07:49.840> because<00:07:50.349> I'm<00:07:50.680> just

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:50.830 
entertaining to watch because I'm just

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.710 
entertaining to watch because I'm just
walking<00:07:51.010> around<00:07:51.580> the<00:07:51.849> spot<00:07:52.090> and<00:07:52.270> completely

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 
walking around the spot and completely

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.839 
walking around the spot and completely
decimating<00:07:53.470> kids<00:07:53.680> and<00:07:53.919> I<00:07:54.010> have<00:07:54.160> to<00:07:54.280> dodge<00:07:54.460> them

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:54.849 
decimating kids and I have to dodge them

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.870 
decimating kids and I have to dodge them
I<00:07:55.120> have<00:07:55.630> to<00:07:55.780> get<00:07:56.349> a<00:07:56.590> ton<00:07:56.950> of<00:07:56.979> kills<00:07:57.280> with<00:07:57.490> my<00:07:57.639> gun

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:57.880 
I have to get a ton of kills with my gun

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.670 
I have to get a ton of kills with my gun
and<00:07:58.150> I<00:07:58.360> just<00:07:58.510> think<00:07:58.660> that's<00:07:58.750> entertaining<00:07:59.560> to

00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 
and I just think that's entertaining to

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.200 
and I just think that's entertaining to
watch<00:07:59.710> but<00:08:00.099> here's<00:08:00.340> where<00:08:00.490> the<00:08:00.610> game<00:08:00.760> ends

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.210 
watch but here's where the game ends

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.170 
watch but here's where the game ends
when<00:08:01.389> I'm<00:08:02.110> four<00:08:02.919> kills<00:08:03.190> off<00:08:03.370> of<00:08:03.550> my<00:08:03.669> quad<00:08:03.940> it

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.180 
when I'm four kills off of my quad it

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.300 
when I'm four kills off of my quad it
was<00:08:04.270> a<00:08:04.300> little<00:08:04.479> bit<00:08:04.660> disappointing<00:08:05.289> hope<00:08:06.250> you

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.310 
was a little bit disappointing hope you

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.529 
was a little bit disappointing hope you
