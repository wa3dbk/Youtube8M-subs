this<00:00:03.720> video<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.230> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.500> be<00:00:04.560> an

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
this video is going to be an

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.000 
this video is going to be an
introduction<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.370> decimals<00:00:09.650> all<00:00:10.650> right<00:00:10.740> what

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
introduction to decimals all right what

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.070 
introduction to decimals all right what
is<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> decimal<00:00:11.580> decimal<00:00:12.210> numbers<00:00:12.780> are<00:00:12.929> numbers

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
is a decimal decimal numbers are numbers

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.480 
is a decimal decimal numbers are numbers
that<00:00:13.380> are<00:00:13.530> written<00:00:13.650> according<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.280> their

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
that are written according to their

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
that are written according to their
place<00:00:14.700> value<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.570> decimal<00:00:15.960> point<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.289> used<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
place value the decimal point is used to

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
place value the decimal point is used to
separate<00:00:17.160> whole<00:00:17.400> numbers<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:17.970> numbers<00:00:18.359> less

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
separate whole numbers from numbers less

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.980 
separate whole numbers from numbers less
than<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.920> were<00:00:20.130> looking<00:00:20.340> at<00:00:20.699> our

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
than one so if you were looking at our

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.210 
than one so if you were looking at our
examples<00:00:21.990> down<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> bottom<00:00:23.119> anything<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
examples down at the bottom anything to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
examples down at the bottom anything to
the<00:00:26.220> left<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> decimal<00:00:29.539> are<00:00:30.560> whole

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the left of the decimal are whole

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
the left of the decimal are whole
numbers<00:00:32.360> anything<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
numbers anything to the right of the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.889 
numbers anything to the right of the
decimal<00:00:34.489> our<00:00:38.510> decimal<00:00:39.510> they're<00:00:39.719> called

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
decimal our decimal they're called

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
decimal our decimal they're called
decimal<00:00:40.260> numbers<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> numbers

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
decimal numbers or these are the numbers

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.959 
decimal numbers or these are the numbers
that<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.030> less<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:44.750> one<00:00:45.860> okay<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.700> our

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that are less than one okay so in our

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
that are less than one okay so in our
examples<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.899> 6<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> whole<00:00:50.460> number<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.410> 1

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
examples here 6 is a whole number and 1

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
examples here 6 is a whole number and 1
is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> whole<00:00:53.039> number<00:00:55.309> okay<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:59.329> 0.76<00:01:00.329> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
is a whole number okay and then 0.76 is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
is a whole number okay and then 0.76 is
that<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> less<00:01:01.920> than<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that is less than one that's on the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.280 
that is less than one that's on the
decimal<00:01:03.210> side<00:01:05.420> 0.06<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> decimal<00:01:07.080> side

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
decimal side 0.06 in the decimal side

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.710 
decimal side 0.06 in the decimal side
and<00:01:07.590> point<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.520> 9<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> decimal<00:01:09.390> side

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.030 

now<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:12.930> we're<00:01:13.110> looking<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
now when we're looking at here just to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.880 
now when we're looking at here just to
understand<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> decimal<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.740> are

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
understand what a decimal is if you are

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.850 
understand what a decimal is if you are
given<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.500> whole

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
given this this is you know one whole

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830 
given this this is you know one whole
just<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.390> were<00:01:21.659> in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
just think of when you were in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120 
just think of when you were in
elementary<00:01:21.990> school<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> were<00:01:22.860> given

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
elementary school and you were given

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640 
elementary school and you were given
base<00:01:23.310> ten<00:01:23.580> blocks<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.320> whole

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
base ten blocks this would be one whole

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
base ten blocks this would be one whole
and<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.580> had<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.000> whole<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.570> would<00:01:27.689> be

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and if we had one whole that would be

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.770 
and if we had one whole that would be
written<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.880> left<00:01:30.150> side<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
written with one on the left side of the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.929 
written with one on the left side of the
decimal<00:01:30.960> point<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.670> point

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
decimal point so that would be one point

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.030 
decimal point so that would be one point
zero<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> could<00:01:34.350> write<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.799> point

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
zero so you could write at one point

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.719 
zero so you could write at one point
zero<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:36.090> over<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:37.189> use<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> number

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
zero or one over one or use the number

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
zero or one over one or use the number
the<00:01:39.090> word<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.500> you'd

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the word one so that's how you'd

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.999 
the word one so that's how you'd
indicate<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> whole<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.229> took<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
indicate a whole now if we took this and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.510 
indicate a whole now if we took this and
we<00:01:44.100> split<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:44.970> 10<00:01:45.329> pieces<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
we split it up into 10 pieces one of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.800 
we split it up into 10 pieces one of
those<00:01:47.700> pieces<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> called<00:01:49.079> 1/10<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.810> if

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
those pieces would be called 1/10 and if

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.100 
those pieces would be called 1/10 and if
you<00:01:51.960> notice<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.490> decimal<00:01:53.970> places

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
you notice here all the decimal places

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
you notice here all the decimal places
are<00:01:55.250> th<00:01:56.360> tenth<00:01:57.360> hundredth<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.909> thousandth

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
are th tenth hundredth and thousandth

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
are th tenth hundredth and thousandth
okay<00:02:00.719> now<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.670> had<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.240> tenth<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:04.020> one

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
okay now if you had one tenth a one

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.730 
okay now if you had one tenth a one
piece<00:02:05.540> that's<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:07.229> tenth

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
piece that's one tenth

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.699 
piece that's one tenth
so<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.520> point<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
so you would be point one because the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.089 
so you would be point one because the
tenth<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.700> first<00:02:11.970> place<00:02:12.270> value

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
tenth is the first place value

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.369 
tenth is the first place value
in<00:02:13.159> decimal<00:02:13.819> place<00:02:14.030> value<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.200> would<00:02:15.290> be

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
in decimal place value so it would be

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.449 
in decimal place value so it would be
0.1<00:02:16.249> or<00:02:16.609> 1<00:02:17.180> over<00:02:17.209> 10<00:02:17.780> or<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.829> using<00:02:19.489> words<00:02:19.689> 1/10

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
0.1 or 1 over 10 or in using words 1/10

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.589 
0.1 or 1 over 10 or in using words 1/10
if<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:23.180> split<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.840> into<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:25.389> hundred<00:02:26.389> pieces

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
if you split that into a hundred pieces

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.800 
if you split that into a hundred pieces
and<00:02:27.139> you<00:02:27.290> only<00:02:27.499> color<00:02:27.859> one<00:02:28.219> then<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.599> would

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and you only color one then you would

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.589 
and you only color one then you would
write<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:31.340> one<00:02:31.579> in<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.969> hundredths<00:02:32.540> place

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
write it the one in the hundredths place

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.319 
write it the one in the hundredths place
and<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.530> would<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.310> zero<00:02:35.000> as

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
and you would have to have this zero as

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.709 
and you would have to have this zero as
a<00:02:35.959> placeholder<00:02:36.579> so<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:37.969> could<00:02:38.299> write<00:02:38.510> at

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
a placeholder so you could write at

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:46.509 
a placeholder so you could write at
point<00:02:38.989> zero<00:02:39.469> 1<00:02:39.939> or<00:02:40.939> 1<00:02:41.689> over<00:02:41.959> 100<00:02:42.439> or<00:02:42.939> 100<00:02:44.829> if<00:02:45.829> you

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
point zero 1 or 1 over 100 or 100 if you

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.520 
point zero 1 or 1 over 100 or 100 if you
split<00:02:46.969> it<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.180> into<00:02:47.389> a<00:02:47.480> thousand<00:02:48.109> pieces<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
split it up into a thousand pieces and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.309 
split it up into a thousand pieces and
only<00:02:48.859> colored<00:02:49.219> this<00:02:49.370> one<00:02:49.819> piece<00:02:50.260> okay<00:02:51.260> you

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
only colored this one piece okay you

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.869 
only colored this one piece okay you
would<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.949> write<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.189> in<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.340> thousands

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
would have to write it in the thousands

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.670 
would have to write it in the thousands
place<00:02:52.969> so<00:02:53.480> you'd<00:02:53.659> put<00:02:53.840> your<00:02:53.989> 1<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
place so you'd put your 1 here in the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.229 
place so you'd put your 1 here in the
thousands<00:02:55.219> place<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.760> you'd<00:02:55.879> have<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> have

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
thousands place and you'd have to have

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.020 
thousands place and you'd have to have
these<00:02:56.569> zeros<00:02:57.079> as<00:02:57.379> placeholders<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.879> would

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
these zeros as placeholders so you would

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.899 
these zeros as placeholders so you would
write<00:02:59.209> at<00:02:59.389> point<00:02:59.629> zero<00:03:00.049> zero<00:03:00.139> one<00:03:00.500> or<00:03:00.980> one

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
write at point zero zero one or one

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.599 
write at point zero zero one or one
thousandth<00:03:02.689> or<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.159> write<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.430> words

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
thousandth or you can write it in words

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.899 
thousandth or you can write it in words
as<00:03:04.909> one<00:03:05.120> thousandth

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
as one thousandth

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.649 
as one thousandth
now<00:03:07.909> what<00:03:08.239> if<00:03:08.329> I<00:03:08.480> colored<00:03:10.180> 237<00:03:11.180> these<00:03:11.329> blocks

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
now what if I colored 237 these blocks

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.809 
now what if I colored 237 these blocks
as<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.989> can<00:03:12.169> see<00:03:12.969> 10<00:03:13.969> 20<00:03:14.930> 30<00:03:15.199> 40<00:03:15.319> 50<00:03:15.799> 60<00:03:16.400> 70<00:03:16.430> 80

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
as you can see 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.830 
as you can see 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
90<00:03:17.090> 100<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.699> is<00:03:19.879> 100<00:03:21.729> this<00:03:22.729> is<00:03:22.790> 100<00:03:23.689> and

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
90 100 so this is 100 this is 100 and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.819 
90 100 so this is 100 this is 100 and
then<00:03:24.049> 10<00:03:24.349> 20<00:03:24.919> 30<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.579> then<00:03:26.299> 7<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.409> could

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
then 10 20 30 and then 7 so you could

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.979 
then 10 20 30 and then 7 so you could
write<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:29.949> 237<00:03:30.949> thousands<00:03:31.909> and<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.180> can

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
write that 237 thousands and you can

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.990 
write that 237 thousands and you can
write<00:03:33.169> that<00:03:33.349> as<00:03:33.579> 0.23<00:03:34.579> 7<00:03:36.159> 237<00:03:37.159> over<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.459> thousand

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
write that as 0.23 7 237 over a thousand

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.080 
write that as 0.23 7 237 over a thousand

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
or in words 237 thousands now this isn't

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.110 
or in words 237 thousands now this isn't
if<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:45.259> had<00:03:46.120> one<00:03:47.120> whole<00:03:47.599> piece<00:03:48.939> colored<00:03:49.939> in

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
if you had one whole piece colored in

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.089 
if you had one whole piece colored in
and<00:03:50.449> then<00:03:51.049> in<00:03:51.199> the<00:03:51.319> second<00:03:51.709> piece<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.669> had<00:03:54.099> 456

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
and then in the second piece you had 456

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.520 
and then in the second piece you had 456
colored<00:03:55.549> in<00:03:55.699> this<00:03:56.509> is<00:03:56.689> where<00:03:56.930> your<00:03:57.079> decimal

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
colored in this is where your decimal

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.939 
colored in this is where your decimal
point<00:03:57.769> would<00:03:57.919> go<00:03:58.479> you<00:03:59.479> have<00:03:59.719> the<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.259> hole<00:04:00.650> on

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
point would go you have the one hole on

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.610 
point would go you have the one hole on
the<00:04:01.370> whole<00:04:01.729> number<00:04:02.090> side<00:04:02.389> this<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.379> whole

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
the whole number side this is the whole

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.800 
the whole number side this is the whole
number<00:04:03.859> side<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.639> then<00:04:05.359> you<00:04:05.479> have<00:04:05.659> the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
number side and then you have the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.039 
number side and then you have the
decimal<00:04:06.049> piece<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:07.519> decimal<00:04:07.909> side<00:04:08.239> so<00:04:08.989> it

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
decimal piece on the decimal side so it

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:15.399 
decimal piece on the decimal side so it
would<00:04:09.319> be<00:04:09.439> one<00:04:09.859> point<00:04:10.519> four<00:04:11.090> five<00:04:11.479> six<00:04:14.409> now

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
would be one point four five six now

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.529 
would be one point four five six now
looking<00:04:15.739> at<00:04:15.829> this<00:04:16.009> number<00:04:16.219> four<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:17.150> five

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.060 

the<00:04:26.330> zero<00:04:26.810> would<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.140> in<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.440> hundredths

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
the zero would be in the hundredths

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.880 
the zero would be in the hundredths
