this but to clarify that's what it is
having<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.710> dual<00:01:09.890> core<00:01:10.130> processor<00:01:10.570> actually

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
having a dual core processor actually

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.270 
having a dual core processor actually
allows<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.020> system<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.380> run<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:12.679> lot<00:01:13.039> longer

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
allows the system to run a lot longer

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.340 
allows the system to run a lot longer
and<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:13.700> much<00:01:14.149> better<00:01:14.390> battery<00:01:14.990> life<00:01:15.050> you

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and have much better battery life you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.440 
and have much better battery life you
get<00:01:15.500> 10<00:01:15.770> hours<00:01:16.039> of<00:01:16.070> normal<00:01:16.520> battery<00:01:16.700> life<00:01:17.000> but

get 10 hours of normal battery life but
if<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.630> actually<00:01:17.869> use<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.350> 4g<00:01:18.860> capabilities

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
if you actually use the 4g capabilities

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.510 
if you actually use the 4g capabilities
you<00:01:20.000> get<00:01:20.179> only<00:01:20.390> nine<00:01:21.140> hours<00:01:21.890> now<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.369> one

positioning a little better here got to

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.150 
positioning a little better here got to
fifth<00:04:43.610> place<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:44.090> know<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.169> sucks<00:04:45.440> still<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:45.979> a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
fifth place I know it sucks still but a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.700 
fifth place I know it sucks still but a
my<00:04:46.550> first<00:04:46.760> time<00:04:46.910> playing<00:04:47.060> this<00:04:47.240> thing<00:04:47.510> my<00:04:48.470> mac

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
my first time playing this thing my mac

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.500 
my first time playing this thing my mac
but<00:04:48.979> he<00:04:49.070> may<00:04:49.190> all<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.460> look<00:04:49.789> really<00:04:50.330> really

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
but he may all it look really really

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.969 
but he may all it look really really
easy<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.020> guess<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.410> pretty<00:04:51.560> easy<00:04:51.710> I'm

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
easy and I guess it is pretty easy I'm

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.279 
easy and I guess it is pretty easy I'm
just<00:04:52.160> not<00:04:52.220> used<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.840> kind<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.080> weird

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
just not used to it it's kind of weird

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.020 
just not used to it it's kind of weird
because<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.800> thing<00:04:57.979> accelerates<00:04:58.580> on<00:04:58.729> its<00:04:58.880> own

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
because the thing accelerates on its own

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.460 
because the thing accelerates on its own
and<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.270> don't<00:04:59.419> know<00:04:59.600> how<00:04:59.900> to<00:04:59.960> do<00:05:00.139> anything<00:05:00.289> else

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
and I don't know how to do anything else

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.719 
and I don't know how to do anything else
really<00:05:00.680> honor<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:01.070> accelerate<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.639> or

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
really honor to accelerate it or

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.700 
really honor to accelerate it or
anything<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:01.970> make<00:05:02.060> it<00:05:02.180> go<00:05:02.270> faster<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.200> feel

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
anything to make it go faster so I feel

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.870 
anything to make it go faster so I feel
like<00:05:03.770> I'm<00:05:03.889> kind<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.100> stuck<00:05:04.340> at<00:05:04.490> whatever<00:05:04.610> speed
