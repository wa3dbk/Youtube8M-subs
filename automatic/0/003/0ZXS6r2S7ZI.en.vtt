00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.780 

our<00:00:06.930> manufacturing<00:00:07.649> process<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.490> really

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
our manufacturing process is really

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.390 
our manufacturing process is really
unique<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.420> fact<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.889> being<00:00:10.889> able<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.250> do

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
unique in the fact that being able to do

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480 
unique in the fact that being able to do
many<00:00:11.880> different<00:00:12.210> types<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.130> sizes<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.160> shapes

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
many different types of sizes and shapes

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
many different types of sizes and shapes
and<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.269> things<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.529> critical

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and and things is really critical

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.880 
and and things is really critical
because<00:00:17.310> our<00:00:18.090> customer<00:00:18.600> base<00:00:18.710> pretty<00:00:19.710> much

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
because our customer base pretty much

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
because our customer base pretty much
designs<00:00:20.400> everything<00:00:21.119> based<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
designs everything based on the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
designs everything based on the
different<00:00:22.439> size<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.769> volumes<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.850> stuff

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
different size and volumes and stuff

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.670 
different size and volumes and stuff
that<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.510> need<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.500> really

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
that they need they don't really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.839 
that they need they don't really
standardize<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.580> any<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:27.109> size<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.529> shape<00:00:28.849> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
standardize on any one size or shape and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.310 
standardize on any one size or shape and
then<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> next<00:00:30.060> step<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.599> take<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.840> actually

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
then the next step we take is actually

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
then the next step we take is actually
to<00:00:31.439> start<00:00:31.619> putting<00:00:31.859> holes<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.610> like

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
to start putting holes and things like

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.110 
to start putting holes and things like
that<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> water<00:00:33.780> jug<00:00:35.120> actually

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that in it with the water jug actually

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.299 
that in it with the water jug actually
there<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.020> got<00:00:37.230> into<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
there the way we got into that is we

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
there the way we got into that is we
have<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> specific<00:00:39.059> customer<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> were

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
have a specific customer that we were

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.459 
have a specific customer that we were
doing<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.520> ends<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> tanks<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
doing the ends of the tanks for in the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
doing the ends of the tanks for in the
cryogenic<00:00:43.710> industry<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.809> basically<00:00:45.809> they

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
cryogenic industry and basically they

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.549 
cryogenic industry and basically they
were<00:00:47.030> their<00:00:48.030> requirement<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.379> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
were their requirement was to actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.790 
were their requirement was to actually
have<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> holes<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> prior<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
have the holes put in it prior to

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
have the holes put in it prior to
getting<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.360> have

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
getting it so that they would not have

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
getting it so that they would not have
to<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> themselves<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.620> refined<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to do that themselves they refined the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.470 
to do that themselves they refined the
process<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:57.199> burning<00:00:58.199> holes<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:59.039> things<00:00:59.359> to<00:01:00.359> be

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
process of burning holes in things to be

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
process of burning holes in things to be
a<00:01:00.510> very<00:01:00.719> key<00:01:01.050> dias<00:01:01.289> process<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.520> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
a very key dias process when you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.740 
a very key dias process when you
actually<00:01:02.760> look<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.539> long<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> takes<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
actually look at how long it takes to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually look at how long it takes to
put<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.070> shape<00:01:08.070> onto<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.549> table<00:01:08.820> located

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
put this shape onto a table located

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.429 
put this shape onto a table located
exactly<00:01:09.960> where<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> hole<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.439> how

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
exactly where you want a hole in it how

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.140 
exactly where you want a hole in it how
big<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.920> hole<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> then<00:01:14.700> go<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
big of a hole you want and then go in

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
big of a hole you want and then go in
basically<00:01:15.689> by<00:01:15.840> hand<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.619> hole<00:01:16.950> saw<00:01:17.280> or

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
basically by hand or hole saw or

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
basically by hand or hole saw or
whatever<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> cut<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> very

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
whatever and cut it it was a very

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
whatever and cut it it was a very
time-consuming<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.470> very<00:01:22.619> tedious<00:01:22.830> process

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
time-consuming and very tedious process

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.649 
time-consuming and very tedious process
and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:23.909> also<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.240> good<00:01:24.420> chance

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and then there was also a good chance

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
and then there was also a good chance
when<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> did<00:01:25.259> cut<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> hole<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.880> may<00:01:27.030> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
when you did cut the hole that it may be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
when you did cut the hole that it may be
a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.570> bigger<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.680> I'll<00:01:29.100> browned<00:01:29.490> or

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a little bigger or I'll browned or

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
a little bigger or I'll browned or
whatever<00:01:30.000> than<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:30.509> supposed<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
whatever than what it was supposed to be

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
whatever than what it was supposed to be
not<00:01:31.860> perfect<00:01:32.159> correct<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
not perfect correct and then so first of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
not perfect correct and then so first of
all<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.329> was<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> first<00:01:36.869> issue<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
all that that was the first issue the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.960 
all that that was the first issue the
second<00:01:37.710> issue<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.220> dealing<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.579> thin

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
second issue is you're dealing with thin

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.240 
second issue is you're dealing with thin
or<00:01:39.210> stainless<00:01:39.630> steel<00:01:39.930> materials<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.070> you're

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
or stainless steel materials that you're

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.819 
or stainless steel materials that you're
trying<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> weld<00:01:41.909> pieces<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.619> those

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
trying to weld pieces on to into those

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.819 
trying to weld pieces on to into those
holes<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.780> what<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.110> find<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.799> that

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
holes and what they would find is that

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.039 
holes and what they would find is that
if<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.430> hole<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.240> egg-shaped<00:01:48.450> or

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
if that hole was a little egg-shaped or

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.920 
if that hole was a little egg-shaped or
a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:50.100> perfect<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.630> weld

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
a little not perfect and you would weld

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
a little not perfect and you would weld
something<00:01:52.170> into<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> great

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
something into it it has a great

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.230 
something into it it has a great
tendency<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.600> warp<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:56.520> part<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
tendency to warp that that part that you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.940 
tendency to warp that that part that you
welded<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.259> basically<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.520> started

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
welded it so basically they started

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
welded it so basically they started
dictating<00:02:02.119> waterjet<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.290> issue

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
dictating waterjet they the other issue

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
dictating waterjet they the other issue
they<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.759> you're<00:02:05.969> welding<00:02:06.180> thin

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
they have is by when you're welding thin

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.990 
they have is by when you're welding thin
materials<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.469> stainless<00:02:08.129> steel<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.789> really

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
materials in stainless steel you really

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.089 
materials in stainless steel you really
don't<00:02:09.209> want<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> heat<00:02:09.599> affected<00:02:10.050> zone<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
don't want a heat affected zone so you

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.650 
don't want a heat affected zone so you
don't<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> material<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.239> hardened

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
don't want the material to be hardened

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.160 
don't want the material to be hardened

by
whatever<00:02:13.560> cutting<00:02:13.950> method<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.430> using<00:02:14.490> for

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
whatever cutting method you're using for

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.530 
whatever cutting method you're using for
using<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.780> plasmas<00:02:16.410> are<00:02:16.620> using<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.540> torch

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
using like the plasmas are using a torch

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.140 
using like the plasmas are using a torch
or<00:02:18.840> something<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.290> you're<00:02:19.890> actually

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
or something like that you're actually

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.130 
or something like that you're actually
changing<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> molecular<00:02:21.450> structure<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
changing the molecular structure of the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.610 
changing the molecular structure of the
material<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.010> hole<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:25.290> only<00:02:25.440> way<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
material at that hole so the only way to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.990 
material at that hole so the only way to
get<00:02:25.800> around<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.220> would<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.730> cut<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
get around that would be to cut a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.270 
get around that would be to cut a
smaller<00:02:27.360> hole<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:27.900> grind<00:02:28.200> back<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
smaller hole and then grind back to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.130 
smaller hole and then grind back to
eliminate<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> heat<00:02:30.239> affected<00:02:30.360> zone<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
eliminate the heat affected zone and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.949 
eliminate the heat affected zone and
then<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.380> one's<00:02:31.590> more<00:02:31.860> labour<00:02:32.160> more<00:02:33.120> more

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
then that one's more labour more more

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.860 
then that one's more labour more more
expense<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.590> do<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:36.209> still<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> perfect

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
expense to do it's still not the perfect

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.800 
expense to do it's still not the perfect
touch<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.670> what<00:02:38.850> they<00:02:39.000> found<00:02:39.300> they

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
touch so so what they found they

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.580 
touch so so what they found they
basically<00:02:40.230> dictated<00:02:40.830> us<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.310> had<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:42.590> get

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
basically dictated us that we had to get

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.990 
basically dictated us that we had to get
the<00:02:43.739> holes<00:02:43.920> cut<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.550> had<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.819> deal<00:02:44.970> with

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
the holes cut and we had to deal with

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.460 
the holes cut and we had to deal with
something<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.600> did<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.930> heat<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
something it did that heat to the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.190 
something it did that heat to the
material<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.190> water<00:02:48.090> jet<00:02:48.390> cutting<00:02:48.630> was<00:02:48.900> really

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
material so water jet cutting was really

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.750 
material so water jet cutting was really
the<00:02:49.350> only<00:02:49.470> option<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.400> could<00:02:50.550> come<00:02:50.730> up

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the only option that we could come up

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.729 
the only option that we could come up
with<00:02:51.060> where<00:02:51.299> we<00:02:51.390> could<00:02:51.569> economically<00:02:52.200> do<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
with where we could economically do that

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.680 
with where we could economically do that
what<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.519> find<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> actually<00:02:54.209> cut<00:02:54.569> it

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
what we find when you actually cut it

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.420 
what we find when you actually cut it
with<00:02:54.780> five<00:02:55.019> axis<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.890> actually<00:02:55.980> cut

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
with five axis is you can actually cut

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.470 
with five axis is you can actually cut
the<00:02:56.810> correct<00:02:57.810> sort<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> perfect<00:02:58.650> circle

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the correct sort of the perfect circle

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.180 
the correct sort of the perfect circle
without<00:03:00.480> having<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> lot<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.680> extra

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
without having to do a lot of extra

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.059 
without having to do a lot of extra
trial<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.299> error<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.780> get<00:03:04.049> there<00:03:04.260> yeah<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:04.980> had

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
trial and error to get there yeah we had

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.800 
trial and error to get there yeah we had
to<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> perfect<00:03:05.580> fit<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> perfect<00:03:06.600> cut

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
to have a perfect fit in a perfect cut

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.050 
to have a perfect fit in a perfect cut
that<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.500> key<00:03:07.709> with<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> machine

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
that was the key with with the machine

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.729 
that was the key with with the machine
that<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.299> ended<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:09.750> with<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.049> power<00:03:10.620> of

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
that we ended up on with the power of

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.240 
that we ended up on with the power of
water<00:03:11.640> jet<00:03:12.030> we<00:03:12.540> were<00:03:12.630> able<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> machine

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
water jet we were able to have a machine

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.569 
water jet we were able to have a machine
that<00:03:14.870> fit<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.200> these<00:03:16.530> these<00:03:16.890> issues<00:03:17.370> that

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
that fit all of these these issues that

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.390 
that fit all of these these issues that
we<00:03:17.700> were<00:03:17.820> looking<00:03:17.850> at<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.070> operate<00:03:20.070> very

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
we were looking at and operate very

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.210 
we were looking at and operate very
easily<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.709> came<00:03:22.950> down<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
easily and then it really came down to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.759 
easily and then it really came down to
just<00:03:23.760> dealing<00:03:24.750> with<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.049> people<00:03:25.170> at<00:03:25.500> par

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
just dealing with the people at par

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.520 
just dealing with the people at par
there<00:03:26.700> were<00:03:26.820> very<00:03:27.090> professional<00:03:27.269> people<00:03:27.989> we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
there were very professional people we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.810 
there were very professional people we
went<00:03:28.739> up<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.100> visited<00:03:29.700> their

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
went up and actually visited their

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.060 
went up and actually visited their
facility<00:03:30.390> in<00:03:30.510> Minnesota<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.859> was<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
facility in Minnesota and it was a

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.729 
facility in Minnesota and it was a
first-class<00:03:32.910> operation<00:03:33.320> throughout<00:03:34.320> it

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
first-class operation throughout it

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.039

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
allows you to do things that you just

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.280 
allows you to do things that you just

we can put it on water jet the center

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.790 
we can put it on water jet the center
out<00:06:28.009> and<00:06:28.159> use<00:06:28.310> that<00:06:28.339> for<00:06:28.550> another<00:06:28.909> part<00:06:29.800> I've

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
out and use that for another part I've

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.829 
out and use that for another part I've
just<00:06:30.860> found<00:06:31.189> it<00:06:31.399> to<00:06:31.490> be<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.789> most<00:06:31.939> useful<00:06:32.089> tool

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:32.839 
just found it to be the most useful tool

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.619 
just found it to be the most useful tool
that<00:06:33.740> we<00:06:34.249> have<00:06:34.430> in<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.699> shop<00:06:34.909> I<00:06:35.180> mean<00:06:35.419> there's

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
that we have in the shop I mean there's

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.480 
that we have in the shop I mean there's
just<00:06:35.779> an<00:06:35.930> unlimited<00:06:36.319> it's<00:06:36.800> only<00:06:37.039> limited<00:06:37.459> by

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
just an unlimited it's only limited by

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.820 
just an unlimited it's only limited by
your<00:06:37.639> imagination<00:06:37.849> what<00:06:38.719> the<00:06:39.110> machine<00:06:39.439> can<00:06:39.649> do

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
your imagination what the machine can do

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.309 
your imagination what the machine can do
but<00:06:40.279> you<00:06:40.370> couldn't<00:06:40.669> do<00:06:40.849> that<00:06:40.879> without<00:06:41.419> 5-axis

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.619 
but you couldn't do that without 5-axis
I<00:06:42.529> mean<00:06:42.860> we<00:06:43.039> use<00:06:43.550> it<00:06:43.759> we've<00:06:44.089> used<00:06:44.240> it<00:06:44.449> as<00:06:44.599> a

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
I mean we use it we've used it as a

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.589 
I mean we use it we've used it as a
drill<00:06:45.050> we've<00:06:45.740> used<00:06:45.949> it<00:06:46.159> as<00:06:46.370> a<00:06:46.399> as<00:06:46.939> a<00:06:47.029> solve

drill we've used it as a as a solve

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.019 
drill we've used it as a as a solve
we've<00:06:48.050> used<00:06:48.229> to<00:06:48.409> I<00:06:48.620> mean<00:06:48.949> to<00:06:49.129> ultimately<00:06:49.849> get
