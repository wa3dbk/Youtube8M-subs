00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
the stairs kind of priority thing so you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.630 
the stairs kind of priority thing so you
can<00:03:11.730> be<00:03:11.820> above<00:03:12.030> everybody<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.709> my<00:03:14.340> whole

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
can be above everybody but so my whole

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.699 
can be above everybody but so my whole
point<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.810> go<00:03:15.990> into<00:03:16.230> gun<00:03:16.500> game

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
point of this is if you go into gun game

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.390 
point of this is if you go into gun game
it's<00:03:16.890> probably<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.250> little<00:03:17.489> easier<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:20.190> gun

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
it's probably a little easier you in gun

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.860 
it's probably a little easier you in gun
game<00:03:20.550> if<00:03:20.640> you're<00:03:20.790> familiar<00:03:21.209> with<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.720> which
