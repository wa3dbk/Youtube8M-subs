00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
platformer with 8-bit graphics I mean

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.999 
platformer with 8-bit graphics I mean
there<00:01:33.900> are<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.200> many<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.590> those<00:01:34.710> but

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
as retro as possible and it feels out of

as retro as possible and it feels out of
place<00:02:03.829> it<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.070> does<00:02:05.570> because<00:02:06.570> you're<00:02:06.719> just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
place it really does because you're just

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
place it really does because you're just
trying<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> jump<00:02:07.530> you're<00:02:07.740> trying<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> kill

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
might have been hard in the 80s

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.130 
might have been hard in the 80s
nowadays<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.730> flat-out<00:02:15.180> frustrating

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
nowadays it's just flat-out frustrating

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.270 
nowadays it's just flat-out frustrating
especially<00:02:16.290> when<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.070> longer<00:02:17.550> games<00:02:19.280> to

especially when you have longer games to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.580 
especially when you have longer games to
complete<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.820> feel<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.690> game<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.350> at

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
complete the feel the game is not at

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.280 
complete the feel the game is not at
least<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> Wii<00:02:23.250> version<00:02:23.730> let<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.390> use<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
were intentionally designed to be clunky

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.710 
were intentionally designed to be clunky
because<00:02:35.970> after<00:02:36.270> all

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
because after all
