you're looking for you get one shot and
that's<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.990> is<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.320> good<00:03:08.740> segue<00:03:08.980> into<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that's it this is a good segue into the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.810 

the<00:03:16.170> valley<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.530> not<00:03:16.800> nearly<00:03:17.130> as<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.430> Kenny<00:03:17.700> as

the valley is not nearly as on Kenny as

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.550 
the valley is not nearly as on Kenny as
I<00:03:17.940> thought<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.210> would<00:03:18.300> be<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.720> quite<00:03:18.960> canny

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
I thought it would be it is quite canny

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.470 
I thought it would be it is quite canny
in<00:03:19.800> fact<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.370> reality<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.970> emotions<00:03:21.360> on

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
in fact the reality of the emotions on

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.150 
in fact the reality of the emotions on
people's<00:03:21.780> faces<00:03:21.960> is<00:03:22.260> arguably<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.920> biggest

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
people's faces is arguably the biggest

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.310 
people's faces is arguably the biggest
reason<00:03:23.640> why<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:23.910> game<00:03:24.240> works<00:03:24.540> as<00:03:24.810> well<00:03:25.050> as<00:03:25.110> it
