00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.019
 did you think a phone like the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.679
 Samsung Galaxy S4 was already big to the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.840
 is not too bad 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.340
 because there come in the second half of this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.440
 many more phones with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.640
 much larger screens and this is the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.300
 first of this kind that we have here 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:33.450
 lie 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:35.010
 douar bij essent measures the first questions 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.809
 that most people have at the sight 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.940
 of this phone 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.040
 fits nicely in the hand nor and fits and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 in the pocket and to later 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.829
 to start 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 yes it fits in a lot of pockets but it 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.700
 is a bit trickier than going to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 smaller phones especially if you sit you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.910
 want to put the phone back in your pocket 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 and then you may have some difficulty with that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.899
 then that is more difficult than with a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.760
 smaller phone and the second yes he 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.320
 is nice in the hand but he is lying 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 not as firmly in the hand as one 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 smaller phone because it is slightly larger 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.500
 is and in particular wider, you have a little more 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.990
 space needed for the handles and thereby 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.549
 it is more difficult to secure tightly 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.799
 so you have more chance that per 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.390
 accident falls out of your hands but such 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.900
 very large screen that has to be 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.909
 benefits 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
 so so much space to browse 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.570
 you don't have to zoom in very often 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.740
 on a web page to see what 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 there is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.950
 and moreover, it is also a whole game 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.720
 nice because there is a lot of room for the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.909
 us green controls and so see you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.990
 nevertheless still a lot of the game and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.509
 that is a big advantage compared to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.950
 from smaller phones but all that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.170
 biggest advantage of such a big one 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.220
 telephone is that there is a lot of space 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.960
 for a battery 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 this is also apparent in this essent meet 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.220
 is a battery with a capacity of more 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.720
 than 4000 milliampere hours that is almost 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.850
 twice as many as many others 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 telephones and that is also apparent from our 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.140
 test the battery because it goes with heavy use 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 He took me no less than 20 hours and that is more 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 than a quarter more than, for example, the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.290
 htc one and the galaxy s4 and with light 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 so do not use properly then it goes 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.829
 that lasts more than a week and 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.659
 that we've been on a phone before 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.340
 seen 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.619
 and then about that screen it has one 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.550
 diagonal of 6.1 inches and a resolution 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.170
 of 720 p to 1280 pixels and the screen is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 very beautiful in itself 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.120
 the brightness as sufficient to match many 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.159
 circumstances 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.540
 to be able to view the contrast is good 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.610
 the color reproduction is OK 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.140
 in short , a lot is good about the screen 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.060
 because there is one thing that really had better 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.500
 could have and perhaps had to and 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.780
 that is the resolution 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.620
 he is in fact hd-ready while full 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.659
 hd 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.010
 or such a diagonal is much more logical 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.629
 number of pixels per inch 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.220
 is much lower than many others 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.530
 And if you have telephones up close 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.510
 look then you really see that one of the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.489
 other special elements to this 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.440
 phone is the hardware that is in it 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.599
 and to be precise the sock that is 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.310
 namely one of how we ourselves and 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.379
 That is how we are one of the few 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.420
 manufacturers of phones that own their own 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.190
 makes its own kind and then of course 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.480
 the question how does he do it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.459
 and the answer is actually complete 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.319
 not bad the processor itself can be quite 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.180
 well come along with the rest alone 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.530
 he remains really strong in terms of graphics 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.579
 behind the gpu 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.170
 simply can't do it all 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.599
 track and if you like graphic heavy games 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.010
 plays then you have a lot of problems 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.959
 then you will suffer a lot 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.849
 framedrops and so that makes it play 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.730
 slightly less than that with a 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.200
 Better grasp is the essence it runs on 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.150
 Android 4 point one 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.419
 has a very special skin d'r over it 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.060
 what we call the same e-motion you my 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.889
 and it is a kind of variant again ai 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.209
 maybe keethy so a custom rom 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.349
 which is for many phones 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.329
 come true 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.790
 and what this does is the head now completely 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.790
 take away everything is in place 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.069
 all application on the home screens 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.629
 shortcuts and widgets and so there is 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.980
 no main menu with an alphabetical 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.139
 order of all applications 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.040
 for example so that makes is something 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.720
 is different than normal 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 and as far as we were concerned we hear 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.930
 easily hold on to the line 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.760
 they in fact place a year 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.739
 just stock android deliver on 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.310
 telephones and there with applications 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.769
 to add 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.840
 it is not a very bad skin to stock 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.190
 Android is a bit better 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.750
 the centimeter has an 8 megapixel 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.510
 camera that 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.010
 Can shoot 1080p videos and that camera 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.510
 he is not bad at all he does it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.760
 especially good in a lot of light 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.510
 then it records many details and that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.340
 looks nice 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.900
 but with less light you can do it already 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 a bit less quickly the flash can 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.739
 not all that lit up you 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.720
 would like but how those pictures less 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.849
 are then, for example, of the lumia 920 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.280
 on the htc one and those are two phones 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.919
 that specialize in recording 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.990
 the penny of images in less light 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.090
 measuring is almost entirely made on its own 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.500
 made entirely of plastic except 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.639
 of course the front that is behind 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.169
 glass plate 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.880
 there are no buttons under the screen 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.319
 buttons are on the screen that is this 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.550
 plenty of room for that 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.110
 on the back you can see that freely 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.160
 little is actually placed only one 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.310
 logo 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.840
 the camera and LED flash and that's it 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.580
 and for the rest the construction actually feels 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.889
 pretty sturdy on the seat there is none 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.449
 keyring no seams in it is not very 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.220
 high-quality material which is very nice 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.599
 but it certainly doesn't feel either 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.130
 bad 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.080
 which is a small disadvantage of it 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.449
 design is that he is actually the big one 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.979
 accentuates the corners that are 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.509
 yes a little bit rounded but 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.560
 not very much finished that still had him 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.509
 made slightly smaller 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.949
 Moreover, he is pretty good at the 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.409
 thick side especially in the middle is that 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.720
 almost 10 mm with, we don't see that whole 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.550
 often more in telephones and thanks to that 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.710
 big question you can still join 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.759
 call so you can definitely call again 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.680
 you might see one on the street 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.680
 kind of weird but it works great 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.539
 let me be clear the big one 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.789
 Telephones such as the ears were cent cent 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.020
 is not for everyone but if you don't 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.369
 sit with that big one 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.139
 you have a whole one centimeter 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:35.839
 pleasant phone with especially one 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.279
 phenomenal battery life but how he has 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.589
 also dropped a few stitches 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.659
 the screen resolution may be somewhat higher 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.830
 and the graphics performance is somewhat disappointing 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.659
 against 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.699
 and that is why we are all the more looking forward to 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.159
 the great appliances of samsung htc and 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.270
 sony that will be released later this year and that 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.399
 about a moment 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.319
 are bulky but 1 thing is clear 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.979
 the big phone definitely has 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.979
 right to exist
