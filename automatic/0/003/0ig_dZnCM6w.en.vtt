00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.290
 and pokémon video games have not always 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.000
 been as we know them today when 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.860
 you work on creating a game 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.470
 some of the elements are 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.410
 partially different as places 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.600
 Colorful characters or others are included 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.850
 that finally end up not being used 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.400
 this is what is known as a 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.500
 beta version sometimes said 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.719
 elements are usually erased once 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.180
 finished the final version but other 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.760
 sometimes they are forgotten and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.379
 they continue in the game code 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.440
 being able to be noticed as a glitch 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.300
 or mistakes as is the case with me or in 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.390
 Each game is infinity of elements 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.489
 beta of the most curious among those who 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.040
 I will show some of the ones that have most 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.130
 called attention in red pokemon and 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.050
 green for example thought of a combat 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.570
 against the teacher or with very pokemon 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.460
 similar to what your opponent would use in 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.159
 the pokemon league this showdown 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.229
 would take place at the entrance to the cova 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.969
 of eastern city where today would put 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.439
 test your strength before the battle 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.990
 final against youtube 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.390
 another beta element is the bird type 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.460
 finally replaced by the flying 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.909
 This is because not all pokemon 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.530
 of this type they looked like a bird 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.720
 currently the only pokemon that counts 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.290
 with this guy is probably the most 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.150
 known clips pokemon my sign added 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.280
 also that at first it was going to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.710
 include the option to choose the gender of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.229
 your character in these editions but the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.540
 idea was finally discarded because I do not know 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.130
 he believed that pokemon would succeed in 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.200
 the female audience 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.540
 the name that this saga was going to have was 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.119
 Caps humor coming from capsule 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.580
 monsters or what is the same monsters 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.710
 of capsules is amazing the great 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.170
 amount of pokemon that were thought 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.509
 at the beginning of which some 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.940
 they were totally discarded and others 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.820
 modified or reused in editions 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.800
 later for example here we have the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.200
 that at first it was going to be the one 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.479
 now we know how hui from which 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.239
 I would call co cana and the rest of pokemon 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.430
 in beta phase of their evolutionary chain the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.920
 which are very different from how 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.019
 they are now others instead like paul 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.640
 same real cop or dragon knight have not 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.840
 varied too much about their 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.370
 final versions 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.650
 because they love how to ride on that yes 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.989
 you remember was the first pokemon to be 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.569
 created in the beginning was going to be called 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.090
 rock and had a somewhat 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.760
 more childish and the latest design of what 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.440
 that was known as cats humor showed 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.959
 who would be the head coach 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.019
 climbed on a pretty paras 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.879
 different both of how short now the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.370
 second generation was shown to 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.739
 public very soon without practically 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.810
 nothing in the game was defined yet 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.780
 so it's the most pokemon in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.390
 its beta phase we have evidence in a 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.940
 beginning rita boy was going to be called japã 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.519
 he had small horns and a body 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.430
 similar to that of a slug instead of its 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.220
 barrel legs would be completely pink 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.680
 and giraffe 'king was going to have two heads in 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.930
 place of a queue which would explain that 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.510
 his name is a palindrome finally 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.540
 wifi had two fins one more tail 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.849
 small and different colors regarding 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.519
 the third generation because that game 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.349
 freak did not plan to continue with the 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.450
 releases of this saga in a 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.640
 principle was kept in mind 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.430
 just a game that would receive the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.739
 name of pokemon heavy abbreviation of 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.680
 advanced game boy instead of today 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.870
 known ruby sapphire we do not have 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 too many elements and pokemon in your 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.970
 beta phase more than a few versions 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.980
 of how it was going to be trico and so many 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.260
 of torch and also the drawing of a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.810
 pokémon that has characteristics of 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.360
 blaze iker and you have been baptized by the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.400
 fans like lady quen on top of whoever 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.010
 find a girl who keeps true 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.670
 similar with crystal and finally grow 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.989
 do not have a slightly flatter head 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.970
 finally and ending with the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.799
 beta pokemon existing until today 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.290
 we have some of which 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.569
 we know practically nothing of them 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.510
 more than their names in Japanese and their 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.329
 physical aspect first of all we have to 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.280
 street not very designed for gold and silver 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.470
 which is known to be plant type 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.169
 bug and he could learn growling 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.180
 strength and tackle possibly this 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.040
 pokemon served as an example for the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.229
 Siwa creation because if you look 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.289
 he keeps a certain resemblance to him 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.419
 Secondly we mention q2 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.089
 also designed for gold and silver like 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.309
 the number 212 of the national pokédex 

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:42.199
 we know about him that he belonged to the guy 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.779
 water and I knew the movements 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.300
 grunts tackling and gun water is 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:48.919
 similar to seal and quite possibly outside 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.949
 to be the initial water of these 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.349
 third editions with or rubber 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.930
 for these same editions it would be 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.210
 fire type and would know malicious scratch 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.999
 and embers kept a certain resemblance with 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.740
 rage and maybe it could be one of 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:06.589
 the initial pokemon of the second 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.569
 generation instead of wild sign other 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:11.539
 beta pokemon of which the only thing 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.219
 it is known is his physical appearance are these 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.830
 two being able to see that the first one is 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.020
 similar to the current fifth turtle 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.300
 generation and the second could be the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.550
 beta version of jean amount which 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.339
 it seems a strange mix between the club 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.099
 facebook and gay shot both appeared in 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:30.199
 a word for pokémon gold and silver together 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.020
 an Iranian tar is looking something 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.089
 different to the current one and until here the 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.189
 video of curiosities and beta elements 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.889
 that gave rise to the current games 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:43.270
 pokemon I hope you liked it 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.270
 in the next video
