 min 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.079
 for your dedicated server countless track 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.319
 The first thing we should do is download the knx 1 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.449
 what can we download from this page that only and who wants to be 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.869
 with a tutorial 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.949
 and I'm just going to take up the description of the video 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.029
 once installed 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.319
 percent 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.319
 let's go to the folder 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.820
 we do not stop installed with 3 30 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.580
 in my case I have windows 7 inc 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.620
 i 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.900
 ia times 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.920
 will not let you 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.370
 set up 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.600
 the file that you downloaded 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.700
 per cent of ana x but that we will solve in the spotlight 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.630
 once they have solved that problem of removing the blockage in 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.540
 people to configure 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.220
 this folder 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.390
 we are going to stop a ceares 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.670
 and it will not continue 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.740
 This sale 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.090
 in this window 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.750
 we're going, let's go 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.110
 until the end 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.960
 and this is where we are going to create 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.450
 laptop 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 So what we are going to do is that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.910
 let's copy 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
 what it says impact 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.210
 and we are going to paste it 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.960
 Once you have a piano, this is what you love doing and what it says 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.340
 magnifying glass 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.660
 we are not going to put our name 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 what you want is to place DNA and for example 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.490
 samuel 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.480
 meanwhile quotes 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.940
 let's place 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.240
 our password 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.030
 it has to be something simple like one two three 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.990
 so that we do not forget 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 and where I did add we're going to place a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.320
 once you have done that 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 what prevails is going to give and go 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.239
 wolves to have saved k 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.569
 and we're going to see what August usher to join 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.299
 now I will explain to you as news in this initiative 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.569
 what we need to do is first open our dedicated server 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.449
 once opened 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.369
 we are not going to write here in this console 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.849
 if we are not going to go 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.099
 count extras 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.329
 at once 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.329
 Transform me term is served 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.499
 and once you're in 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.499
 what are we going to do this 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.899
 we're only going to be able to in the fmi 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.309
 that we have to win 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:01.469
 in the example 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.249
 josé ramón sandoval 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.849
 to use the pp that had had real 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.939
 this public work followed by zamora 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.579
 and already show ap 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.019
 the park has to be exactly 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.869
 you spoke with peace 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.819
 and now 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.779
 once it occurs in men act 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:22.139
 let's go to the consoles 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.959
 we are pleased 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.959
 the currency of mexico is admitted 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:29.829
 after finding the console 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.829
 we are going to place efe 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.589
 space 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:45.639
 knee 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.639
 the password 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.819
 let's do it 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.569
 and now we will see 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.569
 went to verify 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.589
 we see how cinthia I have this command from april 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.789
 percent 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.069
 that command 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.069
 I can not do what I am not the referee 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.699
 that is all 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.419
 of how senior data assurance arises from containing
