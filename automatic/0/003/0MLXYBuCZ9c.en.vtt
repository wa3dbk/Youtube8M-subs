00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.779
 jordy clasie this is everything in afternoon 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.820
 on a number of tram 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.459
 yes sure you can tell if 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.650
 you with six zeros your home now 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.959
 is there anything else that could be improved 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.279
 become or was the competition this year 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.019
 according to the pattern such as feyenoord 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 must be 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.689
 yes I think it 's a number in the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 first 10 15 minutes and we press 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.560
 must touch with a trace we are 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.109
 actually I think after fifteen minutes 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.659
 realized that and that and an ap went 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 play yes but then you know the open 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.660
 house is natural 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.430
 changes a crash arno saens on point 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 and everyone who moves around it how 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.440
 are after packing well by bears 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.910
 was stung year after that you will see that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.320
 that if it all runs it then 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.880
 seems very easy 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.410
 surrounded with it was free for you 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.040
 you bother with your pimples you also 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 real football of a very high level 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.340
 yes it went well the whole team 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.150
 for example good especially thing to the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.120
 108 I yes I saw that nights so full 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.910
 examples do not go towards everything either 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 almost succeed and so you see that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.539
 football sometimes hardly sheets 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.710
 you felt about giving yourself with this 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.229
 also have more or less wetzel 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.509
 freedom because everything seemed to work again 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.329
 yes certainly not know the season yet 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.070
 once with such numbers and won 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.049
 ball fly nectar but where you do 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.689
 This too and you can also get the tools from it 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.399
 the of course on on in the coming 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.229
 maybe even before 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.280
 final position on the ranking 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.310
 so your cousin of our just one 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020
 perfect afternoon and 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 no you will enjoy it tomorrow and 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.039
 then we just go on with it then 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.869
 night driving it went this one 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.979
 week or the bbq 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.420
 about you and you a few times 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.189
 trainer also has at press conferences 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.409
 said a few things about you too 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.179
 about dealing with the pressure to deal with 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.250
 stories from outside interest from 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.079
 clubs and how that can have a physical effect 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.590
 on a player we saw that then 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.450
 last week how about that in your eyes 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 it could well play a role 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.829
 I am young you have such things online 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.810
 of course never experienced 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.780
 yes in principle comes a bit more busy 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.549
 on you then before 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 yes that is such a player you have to deal with 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.080
 and go after that would it would course 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.849
 be that I asked early last week 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.120
 got character but I could be the last 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.489
 weeks 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.769
 volume just right again and yes they do 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.690
 important then we see the come the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.549
 how it will proceed in the coming weeks 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.840
 so just message me completely on the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.940
 last match 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.860
 it said purposefully at rest 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.540
 They work trade target balance that is still possible 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 very important 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.720
 yes sure that's a number in the rest 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.880
 times said 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.000
 of course we knew vitesse big plus 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.230
 4 plus 500 they are to lead us 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.880
 and he is here with six men then wins 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 then you might do well to it 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.250
 last fifteen minutes second must also 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.480
 well one 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.880
 maybe two more 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.569
 but yes a station physical satisfied 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.160
 to be 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.959
 you also have the assistant trainer 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.829
 can be fantastic for annual gift 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.000
 to give 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.950
 yes right I only heard for the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.540
 competitions for years was therefore right 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.299
 no cake with you 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.549
 no not that but no it is this one 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.900
 victory was was for his farther we 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.400
 for the law they call it people 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.019
 spoken supporters in particular would 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.519
 well a successor in the future 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.049
 we can be ronald koeman how 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.030
 look how you work with him daily 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.109
 look at that he has that potential 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.079
 in itself 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.450
 yes certainly not only know about gases 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.940
 mark think that giovanni van bronckhorst 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.739
 too slow in coming is from diploma 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.510
 of course had but no 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.299

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.290
