long<00:02:07.119> ago<00:02:07.180> about<00:02:07.649> cutouts<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.860> these<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.310> can

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
long ago about cutouts on these I can

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.430 
long ago about cutouts on these I can
have<00:02:09.729> these<00:02:09.910> available<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.539> fact<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:10.899> going

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
have these available in fact I'm going

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.400 
have these available in fact I'm going
to<00:02:11.620> probably<00:02:11.920> put<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.400> whole<00:02:12.610> kit<00:02:12.910> together<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
to probably put a whole kit together of

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.550 
to probably put a whole kit together of
the<00:02:15.190> three<00:02:15.459> song<00:02:15.730> bird<00:02:16.000> let<00:02:16.780> me<00:02:16.870> see<00:02:17.050> if<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.530> have

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the three song bird let me see if I have

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.140 
the three song bird let me see if I have
it<00:02:17.890> here<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> eyeballs<00:02:21.550> are<00:02:21.790> kind<00:02:22.090> of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
it here I know the eyeballs are kind of

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.410 
it here I know the eyeballs are kind of
hard<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.450> find<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:23.320> some<00:02:23.500> people<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.300> was

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
hard to find for some people but I was

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.830 
hard to find for some people but I was
thinking<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.810> doing<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.140> having<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
thinking of doing is having the the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.440 
thinking of doing is having the the
pattern<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.130> three<00:02:30.370> cutouts<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:31.120> don't

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
pattern and the three cutouts I don't

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.340 
pattern and the three cutouts I don't
have<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.720> Cardinal<00:02:32.110> here<00:02:32.290> right<00:02:32.470> now<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.209> and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
have the Cardinal here right now and and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.880 
have the Cardinal here right now and and
three<00:02:35.350> sets<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.950> eyes<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.549> go<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:37.090> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
three sets of the eyes to go with that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.259 
three sets of the eyes to go with that
for<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.950> price<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.580> haven't<00:02:39.880> figured<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:40.209> all

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
for a price if I haven't figured out all

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.509 
for a price if I haven't figured out all
that<00:02:40.720> yet<00:02:40.989> but<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.260> will<00:02:41.500> put<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.100> whole<00:02:42.280> kit

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
that yet but I will put a whole kit

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.000 
that yet but I will put a whole kit
together<00:02:42.670> put<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.299> bank<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.140> decide
