before<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> add<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.710> thick

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
before I add it because it was so thick

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.899 
before I add it because it was so thick
and<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.390> literally<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.759> hard<00:01:23.759> to

take it out so I had to melt it and I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.950 
take it out so I had to melt it and I
actually<00:01:26.130> added<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.119> too<00:01:27.299> much<00:01:27.509> so
