 has barely divorced cool and destitute

 tries to demolish all his tents in 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.330
 New York and go to Paris because you 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.280
 there a wonderful heritage awaits 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 namely a flat with garden in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.330
 best location nearly twelve million euros 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.190
 worth and he wants it 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.300
 knock and with the coal somewhere 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.250
 a little quiet in the world 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.330
 to look for cookies to live there 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.709
 Can the problem only as he there 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.600
 arrives if they have a women there 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.370
 matter played before by maggie smith 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.590
 a woman who is a very special kind 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.120
 lease has by being so long in 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.489
 This apartment is allowed to live until she dies 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.440
 and even monthly from peters of money 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.700
 yes, that's the deal 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.380
 and that is not what has done 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.000
 knew and already to be 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.709
 meanwhile deceased father difficult 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.170
 Binding gets thereby still posthumously 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.610
 new low points finally chalked 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.930
 and then the question in the room is like 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.310
 Can this man who has no coal 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.050
 Pay this woman and above all how 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.190
 can somehow still be happy and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.959
 At some point, the daughter beats as well 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.980
 this older lady on and somehow 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.019
 they all hang more together 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.400
 together as you want to know and there 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.290
 But I do not want to spoil too much 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.269
 this place will be the whole 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.010
 sometime from the light comedy 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.260
 tragicomedy still a really fat one 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.880
 drama with a romantic touch what I am 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.019
 many past stories 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.370
 eventually interweave and 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.450
 moral issues in the foreground 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.100
 be provided 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.630
 and it is especially kevin little maggie 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.010
 smith in the main characters in many 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.750
 really nice dialogues 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.910
 present and it is a strip 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.410
 reminds you a bit of one 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.940
 Almost always someone of you 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.750
 has seen with russell crowe in the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.940
 main role 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.079
 ridley scott movie too 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.549
 at that time from the real estate one man 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.560
 I wanted to get rid told to the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.790
 Mean mean ladies and stripes 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.019
 You can become on blu ray dvd 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.370
 watch this is one 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.480
 then you lean back and ask 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.370
 what would I actually be in this 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.570
 make a situation and the whole works 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.470
 just like a play i 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.390
 believe that happens eventually 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.680
 on a play this film and 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.180
 has become very neat but 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.799
 So oscillates between the numbers of yourself 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.299
 Originally said that would be one 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.920
 Film for cineastes is like it is 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.840
 At home , everyone would decide for themselves 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.940
 but who maggie smith and this light 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.190
 films with a French character like 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.450
 I would like to have a look with Lady 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.250
 In any case, there is no need to be elated 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.220
 not absolutely worth seeing but also 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.960
 definitely more 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.030
 is just boring mediocrity because of that 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.610
 he gets from me in his genre as 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.130
 so many genre comedy intersect 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.900
 drama romance six and a half out of ten 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.370
 possible points overall neat 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.410
 six out of ten possible points 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.870
 and me through my review to mario 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.640
 lady lask on a thumb there if this 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.830
 leave it alone if not 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.690
 otherwise that's you there is still one 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.240
 few left around me and tomorrow 15 o'clock 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.770
 Of course, at the latest a new video and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.020
 hope you are with us again 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.020
 of course on the 3
