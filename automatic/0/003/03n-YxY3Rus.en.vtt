include<00:06:45.830> in<00:06:45.919> the<00:06:45.980> description<00:06:46.210> but<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:47.270> figured

include in the description but I figured

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.610 
include in the description but I figured
that<00:06:47.690> I<00:06:47.810> should<00:06:47.900> go<00:06:48.139> ahead<00:06:48.200> and<00:06:48.320> do<00:06:48.500> this

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
that I should go ahead and do this

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.770 
that I should go ahead and do this
because<00:06:48.910> like<00:06:49.910> I<00:06:49.970> said<00:06:50.060> we<00:06:50.210> don't<00:06:50.300> have<00:06:50.389> UCL

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
because like I said we don't have UCL

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.710 
because like I said we don't have UCL
channel<00:06:51.050> this<00:06:51.169> season<00:06:51.610> and<00:06:52.660> traditionally<00:06:53.660> a

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
channel this season and traditionally a

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.060 
channel this season and traditionally a
trade<00:06:54.050> announcement<00:06:54.590> like<00:06:54.680> that<00:06:54.710> would

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
trade announcement like that would

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.650 
trade announcement like that would
happen<00:06:55.400> on<00:06:55.520> the<00:06:55.700> channel<00:06:56.090> so<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:56.300> everyone

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
happen on the channel so that everyone

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.420 
happen on the channel so that everyone
on<00:06:56.870> YouTube<00:06:57.080> side<00:06:57.620> of<00:06:57.740> things<00:06:57.889> could<00:06:58.100> see<00:06:58.310> as

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
on YouTube side of things could see as

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.040 
on YouTube side of things could see as
well<00:06:58.610> but<00:06:58.940> because<00:06:59.480> everything's<00:06:59.900> being

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
well but because everything's being

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.240 
well but because everything's being
managed<00:07:00.380> directly<00:07:00.740> through<00:07:00.889> the<00:07:00.950> coaches

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
managed directly through the coaches

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.650 
managed directly through the coaches
themselves<00:07:01.669> I<00:07:01.730> figured<00:07:02.000> I<00:07:02.150> should<00:07:02.180> do<00:07:02.510> this

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 
themselves I figured I should do this

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.960 
themselves I figured I should do this
and<00:07:02.870> make<00:07:03.770> it<00:07:03.800> available<00:07:04.070> for<00:07:04.610> you<00:07:04.669> guys<00:07:04.700> to
