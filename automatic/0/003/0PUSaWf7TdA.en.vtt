man<00:00:00.269> top<00:00:00.570> gigawatts<00:00:01.669> anyway<00:00:02.669> I<00:00:02.700> have<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.149> for

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
man top gigawatts anyway I have here for

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.260 
man top gigawatts anyway I have here for
starters<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:04.310> graduated<00:00:05.310> cylinder<00:00:05.490> filled

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
starters a graduated cylinder filled

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.080 
starters a graduated cylinder filled
with<00:00:06.830> distilled<00:00:07.830> water<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.370> two<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> I'm

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
with distilled water and two and I'm

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.299 
with distilled water and two and I'm
going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.330> add<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> little<00:00:09.780> bit<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.309> universal

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
going to add a little bit of universal

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.450 
going to add a little bit of universal
indicator<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:13.139> you'll<00:00:13.860> notice<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.429> has

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
indicator and you'll notice that it has

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.070 
indicator and you'll notice that it has
a<00:00:14.639> green<00:00:15.210> cone<00:00:15.690> yeah<00:00:15.870> that's<00:00:16.080> how<00:00:16.250> indicators

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
a green cone yeah that's how indicators

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.200 
a green cone yeah that's how indicators
change<00:00:19.080> color<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> presence<00:00:20.990> quiet<00:00:21.990> this

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
change color in the presence quiet this

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.570 
change color in the presence quiet this
game<00:00:24.710> indicators<00:00:25.710> change<00:00:26.010> color<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
game indicators change color in the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.599 
game indicators change color in the
presence<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.119> an<00:00:27.269> acid<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> base<00:00:28.609> green

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
presence of an acid or a base green

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.049 
presence of an acid or a base green
happens<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> color<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.890> the

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
happens to be the color they are the

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.510 
happens to be the color they are the
indicators<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.540> neutral<00:00:34.110> an<00:00:34.829> Universal

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
indicators are in neutral an Universal

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
indicators are in neutral an Universal
indicator<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> mixture<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
indicator is really just a mixture of

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.250 
indicator is really just a mixture of
several<00:00:37.350> different<00:00:37.860> indicators<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.110> add

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
several different indicators so if I add

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.380 
several different indicators so if I add
a<00:00:40.290> base<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:42.800> once<00:00:43.800> it'll<00:00:44.010> change<00:00:44.370> color

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.720 

no<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.140> don't<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> drink<00:00:49.800> any<00:00:50.190> acid<00:00:50.610> or

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
no you don't want to drink any acid or

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
no you don't want to drink any acid or
base<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:51.120> anything<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.750> every<00:00:51.960> week<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:53.219> what

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
base or anything for every week but what

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.400 
base or anything for every week but what
if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> diver<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:56.010> would<00:00:56.129> still<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.370> top

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
if you got a diver it would still be top

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.240 
if you got a diver it would still be top
good<00:00:58.410> tighten<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.640> anyway<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.190> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
good tighten this anyway so right now we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
good tighten this anyway so right now we
have<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.760> dark<00:01:03.120> purple<00:01:03.420> color<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.260> what

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
have a very dark purple color and what

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.479 
have a very dark purple color and what
I'm<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.309> add<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I'm going to do is I'm going to add a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.890 
I'm going to do is I'm going to add a
little<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> dry<00:01:06.030> ice<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> driest

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
little bit of dry ice as the driest

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
little bit of dry ice as the driest
bubbles<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.680> Norman<00:01:08.340> acid<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.240> one

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
bubbles in there Norman acid and one

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.710 
bubbles in there Norman acid and one
know<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:09.540> kind<00:01:09.720> eyedrops<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:11.510> some<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
know what kind eyedrops of some kind of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
know what kind eyedrops of some kind of
