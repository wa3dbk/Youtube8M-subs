00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
is 180 so the combined total of vision

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.990 
is 180 so the combined total of vision
and<00:02:02.790> Scarlet<00:02:03.299> Witch<00:02:03.479> equal<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.820> I'll

be adjacent to one another they both
have<00:02:23.010> no<00:02:23.250> tokens<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.970> they<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.720> give

merge<00:04:22.109> into<00:04:22.940> fury<00:04:23.940> with<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.450> two<00:04:24.599> firestorms

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
merge into fury with the two firestorms

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.320 
merge into fury with the two firestorms
it<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.220> free

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
it is a free

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.809 
it is a free
action<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.289> would<00:04:28.530> give<00:04:28.770> either<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.669> of

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
action so you would give either one of

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.960 
action so you would give either one of
these<00:04:30.110> firestorms<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.259> free<00:04:31.530> action<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.310> then

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
these firestorms to free action and then

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.929 
these firestorms to free action and then
you<00:04:33.120> would<00:04:33.300> merge<00:04:33.599> now<00:04:34.020> with<00:04:34.319> fury<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.159> the<00:04:35.250> map

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
you would merge now with fury on the map

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.909 
you would merge now with fury on the map
and<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.419> was<00:04:36.569> a<00:04:36.599> free<00:04:37.020> action<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.500> get<00:04:37.650> him<00:04:37.770> in

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
and it was a free action to get him in

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.749 
and it was a free action to get him in
there<00:04:38.159> he<00:04:38.699> now<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.419> able<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.319> be<00:04:40.349> given<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.069> power

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
there he now is able to be given a power

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.149 
there he now is able to be given a power
action<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.659> fury<00:04:43.379> will<00:04:43.740> now<00:04:44.069> pulse<00:04:44.969> wave<00:04:45.330> on

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
action and fury will now pulse wave on

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.990 
action and fury will now pulse wave on
MN<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.430> wasps<00:04:47.780> 11<00:04:48.780> attack<00:04:49.110> on<00:04:49.379> an<00:04:49.620> 18<00:04:50.099> so<00:04:50.580> this

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
MN and wasps 11 attack on an 18 so this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.089 
MN and wasps 11 attack on an 18 so this
is<00:04:51.240> another<00:04:51.659> cool<00:04:51.990> thing<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.379> let<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:52.949> guys

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.080 
meshed into one figure when they come
into<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.919> game<00:05:05.069> they<00:05:05.340> can<00:05:05.490> be<00:05:05.580> given<00:05:05.940> an
