products<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.670> well<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.090> within<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> entire

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
range we will have something for

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.649 
range we will have something for
everyone<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.820> we're<00:01:57.060> absolutely<00:01:57.180> committed

World Cup in high-definition

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.070 
World Cup in high-definition
we'll<00:02:01.820> have<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.150> within<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.540> entire<00:02:02.780> range

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
we'll have that within the entire range

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.590 
we'll have that within the entire range
so<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.190> year's<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> transitionary<00:02:05.090> year

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
so this year's a transitionary year

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.080 
so this year's a transitionary year
really<00:02:05.870> for<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.230> launch<00:02:06.440> of<00:02:06.680> Freeview<00:02:07.580> HD<00:02:07.610> but

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
really for the launch of Freeview HD but

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.510 
really for the launch of Freeview HD but
when<00:02:08.870> we<00:02:08.990> turn<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.770> mean<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.220> know<00:02:10.369> I'm

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
when we turn it in I mean I know I'm

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.790 
when we turn it in I mean I know I'm
talking<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.940> year<00:02:11.180> ahead<00:02:11.360> here<00:02:11.750> but<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.380> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
talking a year ahead here but is it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.920 
talking a year ahead here but is it
likely<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.280> we'll<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.550> triple<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.180> no<00:02:14.330> TVs

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
likely that we'll have triple to no TVs

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
likely that we'll have triple to no TVs
as<00:02:15.320> standard<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.130> think<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:16.820> only<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.970> matter

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
as standard I think it's only a matter

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.240 
as standard I think it's only a matter
of<00:02:17.240> time<00:02:17.510> before<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.960> have<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.290> dvb-t<00:02:18.710> and

my opinion before we can start to do

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.970 
my opinion before we can start to do
that<00:02:32.570> we've<00:02:32.990> seen<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> huge<00:02:33.650> amount<00:02:33.950> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that we've seen a huge amount of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.220 
that we've seen a huge amount of
innovations<00:02:34.520> for<00:02:34.730> 2010<00:02:35.270> with<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.810> broadband

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
innovations for 2010 with the broadband

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
innovations for 2010 with the broadband
capabilities<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> Freeview<00:02:37.610> HD<00:02:37.820> coming

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
capabilities and the Freeview HD coming

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.080 
capabilities and the Freeview HD coming
you<00:02:38.990> know<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> promising<00:02:40.670> times<00:02:40.880> but

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
you know it's a promising times but

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.850 
you know it's a promising times but
Freeview<00:02:41.420> HD<00:02:41.510> s<00:02:41.810> will<00:02:42.350> probably<00:02:42.620> look<00:02:42.710> at

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
Freeview HD s will probably look at

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.770 
Freeview HD s will probably look at
trying<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.160> how<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.520> did<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.150> our<00:02:44.240> free<00:02:44.450> v+

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.500 
not-too-distant future we'll have a look
at<00:02:53.630> how<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:54.050> look<00:02:54.650> at<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.890> dvb-t<00:02:55.280> -<00:02:55.700> with

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
at how we can look at the dvb-t - with

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.240 
at how we can look at the dvb-t - with
two<00:02:56.660> tuners<00:02:56.960> in<00:02:57.020> there<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.410> enable<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.950> to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
two tuners in there so enable to to

two tuners in there so enable to to
watch<00:02:58.430> one<00:02:58.640> HD<00:02:58.970> channel<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.630> record<00:02:59.900> another
