another<00:00:12.789> video<00:00:13.299> this<00:00:13.629> time<00:00:13.929> around<00:00:14.110> we're

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
another video this time around we're

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.390 
another video this time around we're
going<00:00:14.650> to<00:00:14.740> be<00:00:14.799> doing<00:00:14.889> a<00:00:15.160> fairly<00:00:17.400> largely

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
going to be doing a fairly largely

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.060 
going to be doing a fairly largely
requested<00:00:19.210> video<00:00:19.480> it's<00:00:20.140> my<00:00:20.320> render<00:00:20.680> settings

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
requested video it's my render settings

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.550 
requested video it's my render settings
and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:22.570> don't<00:00:22.720> know<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:22.840> guess<00:00:23.020> I<00:00:23.259> have<00:00:23.349> really

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
and I don't know I guess I have really

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.769 
and I don't know I guess I have really
good<00:00:23.680> quality<00:00:24.070> or<00:00:24.160> something<00:00:24.520> end<00:00:24.730> I<00:00:24.910> think

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
good quality or something end I think

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.900 
good quality or something end I think
something<00:00:26.199> people<00:00:26.860> get<00:00:27.009> wrong<00:00:27.219> a<00:00:27.250> lot<00:00:27.489> of<00:00:27.640> time

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
something people get wrong a lot of time

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.990 
something people get wrong a lot of time
is<00:00:28.210> they<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:29.710> assume<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.340> higher<00:00:30.820> the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
is they they assume that the higher the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.389 
is they they assume that the higher the
number<00:00:31.149> it<00:00:32.140> equals<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:33.010> better<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.370> quality

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
number it equals the better the quality

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.540 
number it equals the better the quality
and<00:00:33.789> in<00:00:34.149> some<00:00:34.539> cases<00:00:34.780> this<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.410> truth<00:00:35.649> but

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
and in some cases this is the truth but

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.090 
and in some cases this is the truth but
in<00:00:36.670> others<00:00:36.910> it<00:00:36.940> is<00:00:37.149> not<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.379> right<00:00:38.800> off<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.980> bat

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
in others it is not so right off the bat

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.529 
in others it is not so right off the bat
I'm<00:00:39.370> just<00:00:39.550> going<00:00:39.730> to<00:00:39.820> load<00:00:39.969> up<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.210> clip

yes and you want to select yes a lot of
people<00:01:01.950> think<00:01:02.950> that's<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.370> wrong<00:01:03.489> thing<00:01:03.730> to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
people think that's the wrong thing to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.889 
people think that's the wrong thing to
do<00:01:03.940> or<00:01:03.969> whatever<00:01:04.149> I<00:01:04.509> don't<00:01:04.659> know<00:01:04.719> why<00:01:04.839> it

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
do or whatever I don't know why it

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.139 
do or whatever I don't know why it
doesn't<00:01:05.110> have<00:01:05.199> audio<00:01:05.320> that's<00:01:05.619> weird<00:01:06.149> here

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
doesn't have audio that's weird here

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.609 
doesn't have audio that's weird here
once<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.719> can<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:07.930> grab<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.140> different<00:01:08.469> one<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
once I can we grab a different one and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.920 
once I can we grab a different one and
same<00:01:11.619> thing<00:01:11.649> I<00:01:12.070> realize<00:01:12.969> it's<00:01:13.090> got<00:01:13.240> audio<00:01:13.420> okay

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
same thing I realize it's got audio okay

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.730 
same thing I realize it's got audio okay
so<00:01:14.100> after<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.429> um<00:01:16.289> you're<00:01:17.289> probably<00:01:17.439> to<00:01:17.709> go

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
so after that um you're probably to go

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.529 
so after that um you're probably to go
on<00:01:17.950> here<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.219> get<00:01:18.369> be<00:01:18.459> like<00:01:18.490> hey<00:01:18.789> it's<00:01:19.359> only

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
on here and get be like hey it's only

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.559 
on here and get be like hey it's only
eight<00:01:19.749> bit<00:01:20.039> it's<00:01:21.039> got<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.219> be<00:01:21.280> 32<00:01:21.609> bit<00:01:21.819> it's

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
eight bit it's got to be 32 bit it's

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.719 
eight bit it's got to be 32 bit it's
obviously<00:01:22.929> not<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.229> best<00:01:23.380> quality<00:01:23.639> well<00:01:24.639> it

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
obviously not the best quality well it

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.519 
obviously not the best quality well it
just<00:01:24.759> so<00:01:25.030> happens<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.479> 8-bit<00:01:26.079> is<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.259> lot

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:26.529 
just so happens that 8-bit is a lot

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.219 
just so happens that 8-bit is a lot
better<00:01:26.709> quality<00:01:27.249> than<00:01:27.279> 32<00:01:27.850> bit<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.240> although

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
better quality than 32 bit and although

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.449 
better quality than 32 bit and although
sometimes<00:01:29.499> you<00:01:29.799> will<00:01:29.889> really<00:01:30.100> notice<00:01:30.249> the

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
sometimes you will really notice the

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.609 
sometimes you will really notice the
difference<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:31.090> some<00:01:31.749> cases<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.289> will<00:01:32.380> just

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
difference in some cases it will just

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.819 
difference in some cases it will just
destroy<00:01:32.859> your<00:01:33.130> quality<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.520> noticed<00:01:34.020> any<00:01:35.020> IRL

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
destroy your quality I noticed any IRL

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.399 
destroy your quality I noticed any IRL
videos<00:01:36.189> like<00:01:36.429> with<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.270> canon<00:01:37.779> t2i<00:01:37.899> like<00:01:38.319> i

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
videos like with the canon t2i like i

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.219 
videos like with the canon t2i like i
did<00:01:38.560> for<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.829> setups<00:01:39.159> if<00:01:39.819> you<00:01:40.359> especially

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
did for the setups if you especially

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.620 
did for the setups if you especially
noticed<00:01:41.859> quite<00:01:42.189> a<00:01:42.249> hurt<00:01:42.520> on<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.060> quality<00:01:43.359> when

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
noticed quite a hurt on the quality when

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.959 
noticed quite a hurt on the quality when
you<00:01:43.719> said<00:01:43.869> it's<00:01:44.020> 32<00:01:44.499> so<00:01:45.249> just<00:01:45.549> keep<00:01:45.639> this<00:01:45.789> at

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
you said it's 32 so just keep this at

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.239 
you said it's 32 so just keep this at
eight<00:01:46.090> other<00:01:46.899> than<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.380> just<00:01:47.409> set<00:01:47.859> this<00:01:48.009> to

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
eight other than that just set this to

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.239 
eight other than that just set this to
best<00:01:48.509> set<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:49.689> to<00:01:49.869> best<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.499> those<00:01:51.069> are<00:01:51.219> the

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
best set this to best and those are the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.699 
best set this to best and those are the
two<00:01:51.490> things<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.759> need<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:51.939> do<00:01:52.119> here<00:01:52.709> once

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
two things you need to do here once

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.529 
two things you need to do here once
you're<00:01:53.829> done<00:01:53.919> rendering<00:01:54.219> or<00:01:54.639> editing<00:01:55.209> so<00:01:55.509> I

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
you're done rendering or editing so I

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.809 
you're done rendering or editing so I
don't<00:01:55.779> know<00:01:55.869> just<00:01:56.020> like<00:01:56.259> cut<00:01:57.099> it<00:01:57.249> or<00:01:57.459> something

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
don't know just like cut it or something

do<00:04:08.989> nothing<00:04:09.230> video<00:04:09.950> rendering<00:04:10.130> quality<00:04:10.340> best

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
do nothing video rendering quality best

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.479 
do nothing video rendering quality best
that's<00:04:11.900> really<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.440> then<00:04:12.709> just<00:04:13.010> go<00:04:13.220> ahead<00:04:13.250> and

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
that's really it then just go ahead and

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.360 
that's really it then just go ahead and
render<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.180> you're<00:04:14.600> good<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.780> go<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:16.100> that's

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
render and you're good to go so that's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.039 
render and you're good to go so that's
basically<00:04:16.580> I<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.419> wanted<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.720> keep<00:04:17.870> this

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
basically I just wanted to keep this

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.960 
basically I just wanted to keep this
nice<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.320> quick<00:04:18.680> those<00:04:19.430> are<00:04:19.580> my<00:04:19.609> render

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
nice and quick those are my render

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.390 
nice and quick those are my render

settings this video will be rendered at

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.909

these<00:04:22.610> settings<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.470> that's<00:04:24.470> basically<00:04:24.680> it

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
these settings and that's basically it

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.210 
these settings and that's basically it
thanks<00:04:25.310> for<00:04:25.340> watching<00:04:25.460> hope<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.030> was<00:04:26.180> helpful
