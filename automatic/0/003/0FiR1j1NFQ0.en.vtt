00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.109
 Self-runners and welcome to the new gameplay you herders and come 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.869
 painted 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.230
 Today an icon to One Team Deathmatch often pass years 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.019
 and for the people who have already paid attention 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.580
 bottom right is another D-pad I do not know if Foundation Band on 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.249
 the publisher is tax-free 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.970
 and I spent those games on the Xbox 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.309
 my Xbox arrived now but a good two days ago 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.980
 Of course I immediately got a black box with two runs if I did 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 to describe my well-being Xbox is both enough for me 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 yes this my two topics Jupiter played I have now ten 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.940
 Guys or something 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.510
 but completely deserving of playing and I think it has become more 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.960
 the gameplay 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.500
 privately i would like to have a little impressions of a year ago so first 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.050
 If the Storm had noticed what it was like that is also quite a whole 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 playing other experience at ispo made the first series choice 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.690
 yes, the control is also slightly changed and I have to say I have 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.700
 I can not give the beginning these proud you shoot everything is from 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.900
 Bishop Ackermann could not do it 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 After a few hours, we play well 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.650
 settled in I say 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.080
 and I'm fine with it 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.230
 m for the people my crew want to eat I think i only got 1 4 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.990
 8 AktG or something like that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 is not the best but for me to give it 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.640
 to the community on the Xbox so I bring games both to the procured 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.690
 or Tibet match 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.970
 So nine against nine lobbyists and 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.620
 When I say that at the PS3 Games I have to say it is very many 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.840
 up you was a lot of campers so this is a fairytale meanwhile 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.689
 and I thought that's 11 of Expo 2000 but I got it then we know it 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.980
 I think 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.940
 that is not so bad on the Xbox Community APA so the impression 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.310
 on whom to fall 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.969
 I would be very rare enough type very very rare form a novelty at 11 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.990
 And unfortunately I will not do that too often, I have that too 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.030
 Wondering in the catering touches the compacted boxes should be larger 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.529
 So that the snipers can meet Danes better 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.899
 I think the community side is perfect in this victory 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.229
 may be that she wants to be a little crazy because I have not too deep 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.229
 was brought now had not played but also the Xbox 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.769
 Of course this can be like a couple of days of player victories over the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.749
 youtube-everything occurs 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.849
 I do not want that open either 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.349
 But in the year that is so my first impressions I have collected now 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:37.029
 i'll miss him he plays facebook today at 12 o'clock so i would 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 a bit like hinting at them like all players needed 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.680
 he fetched Fabian Senft 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 KÃ¶pke truck Schorle announced shit but well 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.779
 you would like to ask that you do not turn me on 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.729

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.649

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.169

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.840

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.289
