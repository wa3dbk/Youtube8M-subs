we're<00:01:16.840> looking<00:01:17.020> at<00:01:17.380> how<00:01:17.770> much<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.100> your

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
we're looking at how much of your

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.219 
we're looking at how much of your
potential<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.880> guys<00:01:19.060> are<00:01:19.270> utilizing<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:19.960> how

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
potential you guys are utilizing and how

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.800 
potential you guys are utilizing and how
to<00:01:20.290> maximize<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:21.100> potential<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.509> what<00:01:22.720> we're

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
to maximize that potential so what we're

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.179 
to maximize that potential so what we're
gonna<00:01:22.869> do<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.439> we're<00:01:23.530> going<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.680> measure<00:01:23.950> the

gonna do is we're going to measure the

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.620 
gonna do is we're going to measure the
volume<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.549> oxygen<00:01:24.729> that<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.090> take<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.450> while

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
volume of oxygen that you take in while

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.999 
volume of oxygen that you take in while
you're<00:01:25.750> running<00:01:25.840> we're<00:01:26.710> going<00:01:26.829> to<00:01:26.890> measure

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
going to find that point as well the key

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.240 
going to find that point as well the key
though<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.390> understand<00:01:53.170> where<00:01:53.920> your<00:01:54.070> base<00:01:54.219> is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
though is understand where your base is

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.279 
though is understand where your base is
where<00:01:54.850> your<00:01:54.969> threshold<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.810> how<00:01:55.990> should

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
where your threshold is and how should

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.649 
where your threshold is and how should
you<00:01:56.469> be<00:01:56.590> training<00:01:56.829> right<00:01:57.100> now<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you be training right now and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.359 
you be training right now and
individualize<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.920> what<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.189> do

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
individualize it to you and what you do

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.130 
individualize it to you and what you do
with<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.520> program<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.659> do<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.960> base

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
with that program is you do this base

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.830 
with that program is you do this base
assessment<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:03.310> do<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.579> program<00:02:03.969> and<00:02:04.240> then

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
assessment you do the program and then

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.779 
assessment you do the program and then
you<00:02:04.990> reassess<00:02:05.710> about<00:02:06.070> 12<00:02:06.369> weeks<00:02:06.549> down<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
you reassess about 12 weeks down the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.320 
you reassess about 12 weeks down the
road<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.299> see<00:02:08.170> how<00:02:08.350> these<00:02:08.560> zones<00:02:08.860> change<00:02:09.340> so

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
road and see how these zones change so

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.420 
road and see how these zones change so
just<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.899> pros<00:02:11.080> train<00:02:11.500> offseason<00:02:12.250> on

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
just like the pros train offseason on

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.250 
just like the pros train offseason on
season<00:02:12.820> we're<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.630> start<00:02:13.810> training<00:02:14.020> you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
season we're going to start training you

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.470 
season we're going to start training you
like<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.800> pros<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.580> basically<00:02:15.880> build<00:02:16.240> your

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
like the pros to basically build your

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.330 
like the pros to basically build your
base<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:17.260> your<00:02:17.410> intervals<00:02:17.739> peak<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.250> your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
base do your intervals peak for your

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.150 
base do your intervals peak for your
event<00:02:18.610> go<00:02:19.209> back<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.540> base<00:02:19.660> training<00:02:19.980> peak<00:02:20.980> for

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
event go back to base training peak for

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.680 
event go back to base training peak for
your<00:02:21.280> next<00:02:21.400> event<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.450> forth

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
your next event so on and so forth

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.160 
your next event so on and so forth
that's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
that's

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.930 
that's
how<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.680> really<00:02:23.920> want<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> train<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.790> that's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
how you really want to train and that's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.479 
how you really want to train and that's
how<00:02:25.120> we're<00:02:25.240> gonna<00:02:25.300> use<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.660> science<00:02:26.489> even

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
how we're gonna use the science even

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.650 
how we're gonna use the science even
though<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> was<00:02:27.790> feeling<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.120> little<00:02:28.300> under<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
though I was feeling a little under the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.070 
though I was feeling a little under the
weather

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
weather

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
weather
no<00:02:29.470> pain<00:02:29.739> no<00:02:29.950> gain<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.489> got<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> treadmill

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
no pain no gain I got on the treadmill

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.420 
no pain no gain I got on the treadmill
and<00:02:31.660> showed<00:02:31.870> my<00:02:32.110> campers<00:02:32.620> how<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.890> test<00:02:33.250> is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and showed my campers how the test is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.300 
and showed my campers how the test is
done<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.510> basically<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.319> red<00:02:35.530> line<00:02:35.739> here<00:02:36.069> is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
done but basically the red line here is

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.760 
done but basically the red line here is
the<00:02:36.489> volume<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.880> oxygen<00:02:37.060> she's<00:02:37.480> consuming<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
the volume of oxygen she's consuming the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.740 
the volume of oxygen she's consuming the
blue<00:02:39.010> line<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.610> volume<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.150> carbon

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
blue line is the volume of carbon

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.199 
blue line is the volume of carbon
dioxide<00:02:40.870> she's<00:02:41.380> producing<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:42.819> means<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
dioxide she's producing that means the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.600 
dioxide she's producing that means the
yellow<00:02:43.480> line<00:02:43.720> here<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.950> fat<00:02:45.190> calorie

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
yellow line here is the fat calorie

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.920 
yellow line here is the fat calorie
utilization<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.390> she's<00:02:46.540> going<00:02:46.780> through

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
utilization that she's going through

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.490 
utilization that she's going through
right<00:02:47.080> now

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
right now

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.960 
right now
so<00:02:47.890> whatever<00:02:48.040> body's<00:02:48.370> burning<00:02:48.580> fat<00:02:48.819> or

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
so whatever body's burning fat or

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.000 
so whatever body's burning fat or
carbohydrates<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.959> work<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.860> then

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
carbohydrates to do the work and then

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.710 
carbohydrates to do the work and then
the<00:02:51.130> Green<00:02:51.310> Line<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.550> our<00:02:51.819> heart<00:02:52.030> rate<00:02:52.209> so

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the Green Line is our heart rate so

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.229 
the Green Line is our heart rate so
we're<00:02:52.840> taking<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.410> response<00:02:54.120> calibrated<00:02:55.120> to

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
we're taking this response calibrated to

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.370 
we're taking this response calibrated to
our<00:02:55.300> heart<00:02:55.510> rate<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.840> then<00:02:56.019> we're<00:02:56.110> gonna<00:02:56.200> give

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
our heart rate and then we're gonna give

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.780 
our heart rate and then we're gonna give
her<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.500> heart<00:02:56.680> rate<00:02:56.800> training<00:02:57.100> program<00:02:57.400> she's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
her a heart rate training program she's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.309 
her a heart rate training program she's
gonna<00:02:57.940> start<00:02:58.209> out<00:02:58.300> walking<00:02:58.540> then<00:02:59.200> we're

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
gonna start out walking then we're

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.110 
gonna start out walking then we're
adding<00:02:59.470> 1<00:02:59.890> mile<00:03:00.100> an<00:03:00.220> hour<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.519> speed<00:03:00.760> now<00:03:00.910> she's

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
adding 1 mile an hour of speed now she's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.809 
adding 1 mile an hour of speed now she's
doing<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.420> nine<00:03:01.660> mile<00:03:01.870> an<00:03:01.989> hour<00:03:02.049> protocol<00:03:02.590> today

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
doing a nine mile an hour protocol today

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.590 
doing a nine mile an hour protocol today
so<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.970> speed<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.299> we're<00:03:04.390> gonna<00:03:04.480> be

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
so the speed that we're gonna be

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.759 
so the speed that we're gonna be
choosing<00:03:04.989> for<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.709> be

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
choosing for this is going to be

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.160 
choosing for this is going to be
specific<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.280> your<00:03:06.580> running<00:03:07.000> pace<00:03:07.180> Gary<00:03:07.989> can

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
specific to your running pace Gary can

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.509 
specific to your running pace Gary can
run<00:03:08.260> all<00:03:08.380> day<00:03:08.530> at<00:03:08.650> 9<00:03:08.799> miles<00:03:09.010> an<00:03:09.190> hour<00:03:09.310> that's

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
run all day at 9 miles an hour that's

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.100 
run all day at 9 miles an hour that's
what<00:03:09.640> we're<00:03:09.760> using<00:03:09.940> if<00:03:10.269> you're<00:03:10.510> more<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.870> six

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
what we're using if you're more of a six

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.720 
what we're using if you're more of a six
mile<00:03:11.290> an<00:03:11.410> hour<00:03:11.500> person<00:03:11.920> or<00:03:12.010> even<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.250> 5<00:03:12.430> mile<00:03:12.640> an

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
mile an hour person or even a 5 mile an

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.949 
mile an hour person or even a 5 mile an
hour<00:03:12.790> person<00:03:13.180> that's<00:03:13.360> what<00:03:13.510> we're<00:03:13.600> gonna<00:03:13.690> test

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
hour person that's what we're gonna test

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.110 
hour person that's what we're gonna test
yet<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.739> what<00:03:15.250> we're<00:03:15.400> gonna<00:03:15.459> do<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.880> going<00:03:16.060> to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
yet so what we're gonna do is going to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.280

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
you up to that pace over the course of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.809 
you up to that pace over the course of
the<00:03:20.470> first<00:03:20.590> five<00:03:20.860> minutes<00:03:21.130> or<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.340> speaking

what you can go up to six and then we're
going<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.370> add<00:03:24.489> two<00:03:24.700> percent<00:03:25.030> incline<00:03:25.330> for<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
going to add two percent incline for a

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.880 
going to add two percent incline for a
minute<00:03:25.810> until<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.440> get<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.709> your

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
minute until we get you to your

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.400 
minute until we get you to your
anaerobic<00:03:27.400> threshold<00:03:27.750> okay<00:03:28.750> your<00:03:28.930> threshold

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
anaerobic threshold okay your threshold

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.630 
anaerobic threshold okay your threshold
is<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.650> point<00:03:29.859> where<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.100> start<00:03:30.340> feeling<00:03:30.609> a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
is that point where you start feeling a

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.520 
is that point where you start feeling a
little<00:03:30.670> bit<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:31.000> burn<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.359> legs<00:03:31.570> when<00:03:32.410> you

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
little bit of burn in the legs when you

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
feel that burn that's about the time

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.460

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
where you've got a minute left in the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.810 
where you've got a minute left in the
assessment<00:03:35.890> if<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.160> weren't<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.489> fit<00:03:36.700> this

right<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.460> is<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.670> cool-down<00:03:51.180> phase<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
right this is the cool-down phase of the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.810 
right this is the cool-down phase of the
assessment<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.560> not<00:03:52.740> only<00:03:53.070> are<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:53.280> looking<00:03:53.340> at

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
assessment so not only are we looking at

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.240 
assessment so not only are we looking at
her<00:03:54.450> ramping<00:03:54.930> up<00:03:55.050> speed<00:03:55.410> we're<00:03:55.920> looking<00:03:56.190> at

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
her ramping up speed we're looking at

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.250 
her ramping up speed we're looking at
how<00:03:56.400> BETT<00:03:56.670> how<00:03:56.850> well<00:03:57.060> her<00:03:57.270> body<00:03:57.510> recovers<00:03:58.050> so

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
how BETT how well her body recovers so

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.390 
how BETT how well her body recovers so
we're<00:03:58.380> going<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.530> track<00:03:58.770> her<00:03:58.920> 1-minute

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
we're going to track her 1-minute

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.740 
we're going to track her 1-minute
recovery<00:03:59.820> we're<00:04:00.240> going<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.420> track<00:04:00.600> her

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
recovery we're going to track her

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.630 
recovery we're going to track her
two-minute<00:04:01.170> recovery<00:04:01.560> if<00:04:02.100> your<00:04:02.310> heart<00:04:02.460> rates

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
two-minute recovery if your heart rates

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.190 
two-minute recovery if your heart rates
remaining<00:04:02.940> elevated<00:04:03.630> for<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> long<00:04:04.020> duration

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
remaining elevated for a long duration

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.620 
remaining elevated for a long duration
of<00:04:04.530> time<00:04:04.680> after<00:04:05.010> your<00:04:05.130> run<00:04:05.390> number<00:04:06.390> one<00:04:06.510> it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
of time after your run number one it

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.450 
of time after your run number one it
means<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.960> didn't<00:04:07.170> cooldown<00:04:07.500> or<00:04:07.980> number<00:04:08.280> two

towards<00:04:09.870> an<00:04:09.960> overtraining<00:04:10.380> scenario<00:04:10.800> so

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
towards an overtraining scenario so

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.070 
towards an overtraining scenario so
that's<00:04:11.460> a<00:04:11.580> metabolic<00:04:11.820> assessment<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.660> a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
that's a metabolic assessment on a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.140 
that's a metabolic assessment on a
