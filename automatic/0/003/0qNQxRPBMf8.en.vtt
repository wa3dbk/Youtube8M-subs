imagine being able to call them and see

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.160 
imagine being able to call them and see
them<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.040> also<00:01:23.190> look<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.210> their<00:01:24.390> eyes<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
them but also look into their eyes and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.940 
them but also look into their eyes and
see<00:01:25.560> how<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:25.980> really<00:01:26.130> doing<00:01:27.740> what<00:01:28.740> makes

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
see how are they really doing what makes

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.700 
see how are they really doing what makes
it<00:01:29.070> even<00:01:29.280> better<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.870> switches<00:01:31.440> from

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it even better is that it switches from

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.250 
it even better is that it switches from
the<00:01:31.800> front<00:01:32.130> camera<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.030> back<00:01:33.180> camera<00:01:33.660> so

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
the front camera to the back camera so

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.859 
the front camera to the back camera so
you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.380> show<00:01:35.160> someone<00:01:35.360> what<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.570> seeing

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
efficiency in a really small chip the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.810 
efficiency in a really small chip the
one<00:04:37.810> thing<00:04:38.020> we<00:04:38.170> made<00:04:38.350> larger<00:04:38.950> was<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.460> battery

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
one thing we made larger was the battery

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.320 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:40.030> fact<00:04:40.570> iPhone<00:04:41.140> 4<00:04:41.440> delivers<00:04:41.950> up<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.400> 40%<00:04:42.760> more

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
in fact iPhone 4 delivers up to 40% more

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.350 
in fact iPhone 4 delivers up to 40% more
talk<00:04:43.570> time

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
talk time

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.350 
talk time
we<00:04:46.110> started<00:04:46.680> with<00:04:47.210> completely<00:04:48.210> opposing

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
we started with completely opposing

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.170 
we started with completely opposing
goals<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.650> we<00:04:50.009> wanted<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> make<00:04:50.520> this<00:04:50.699> iPhone

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
goals and we wanted to make this iPhone

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420 
goals and we wanted to make this iPhone
more<00:04:51.810> capable<00:04:52.349> we<00:04:52.620> wanted<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.009> add<00:04:53.129> more

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
more capable we wanted to add more

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.209 
more capable we wanted to add more
feature<00:04:53.759> and<00:04:54.599> yet<00:04:55.110> at<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.289> same<00:04:55.530> time<00:04:55.800> we

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
feature and yet at the same time we

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.589 
feature and yet at the same time we
wanted<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.580> make<00:04:56.699> it<00:04:56.819> smaller<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.509> even

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
wanted to make it smaller and even

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.749 
wanted to make it smaller and even
thinner<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.439> that<00:04:59.159> led<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.520> some<00:04:59.729> really

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
thinner and that led to some really

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.619 
thinner and that led to some really
surprising<00:05:00.330> innovation<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:03.090> we<00:05:03.210> developed

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
surprising innovation and we developed

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.839 
surprising innovation and we developed
an<00:05:03.750> entirely<00:05:04.319> new<00:05:04.650> grade<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.280> stainless

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
an entirely new grade and stainless

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.990 
an entirely new grade and stainless
steel<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.659> after<00:05:06.990> machining<00:05:07.409> is<00:05:08.069> incredibly

steel that after machining is incredibly

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
steel that after machining is incredibly
strong<00:05:09.389> but<00:05:09.780> also<00:05:10.530> remarkably<00:05:11.189> precise<00:05:12.020> the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
strong but also remarkably precise the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.260 
strong but also remarkably precise the
steel<00:05:13.319> frame<00:05:13.680> functions<00:05:14.280> as<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.460> antenna<00:05:15.000> but

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
steel frame functions as the antenna but

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.020 
steel frame functions as the antenna but
also<00:05:15.719> the<00:05:16.259> primary<00:05:16.710> structure<00:05:17.250> giving<00:05:17.909> us

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
also the primary structure giving us

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.309 
also the primary structure giving us
more<00:05:18.270> internal<00:05:18.780> volume<00:05:20.479> we<00:05:21.479> also<00:05:21.599> developed<00:05:22.199> a

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
more internal volume we also developed a

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.230 
more internal volume we also developed a
custom<00:05:22.710> glass<00:05:22.979> that's<00:05:23.580> comparable<00:05:24.150> in
