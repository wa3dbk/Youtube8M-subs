00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
frustrating here is we think that weight

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.100 
frustrating here is we think that weight
loss<00:01:24.759> should<00:01:24.910> just<00:01:25.090> continue<00:01:25.240> everyone

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
loss should just continue everyone

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.660 
loss should just continue everyone
always<00:01:26.229> talks<00:01:26.500> about<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.130> know<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.520> could

lose<00:01:27.910> on<00:01:28.119> average<00:01:28.270> two<00:01:29.229> pounds<00:01:29.560> per<00:01:29.680> week<00:01:29.710> but

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
lose on average two pounds per week but

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.190 
lose on average two pounds per week but
this<00:01:30.789> is<00:01:30.970> an<00:01:31.149> average<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:31.899> is<00:01:32.050> not

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
this is an average this is not

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.499 
this is an average this is not
necessarily<00:01:32.649> every<00:01:33.250> week<00:01:33.429> one<00:01:34.149> of<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.300> things

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
necessarily every week one of the things

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.290 
necessarily every week one of the things
with<00:01:34.660> weight<00:01:34.840> loss<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:36.220> even<00:01:37.179> though

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
with weight loss is that even though

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.449 
with weight loss is that even though
some<00:01:37.690> things<00:01:37.929> work<00:01:38.200> they<00:01:38.590> never<00:01:38.830> work<00:01:39.130> forever

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
some things work they never work forever

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.359 
some things work they never work forever
and<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.539> this<00:01:40.660> case<00:01:40.899> for<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.369> running

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
and so in this case for you running

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.609 
and so in this case for you running
three<00:01:42.640> or<00:01:42.759> six<00:01:42.970> miles<00:01:43.209> four<00:01:43.750> times<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.110> week

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
three or six miles four times a week

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.469 
three or six miles four times a week
that<00:01:44.979> works<00:01:45.190> really<00:01:45.369> well<00:01:45.610> but<00:01:46.179> now<00:01:46.300> that

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
that works really well but now that

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.389 
that works really well but now that
doesn't<00:01:46.780> work<00:01:46.869> anymore<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.860> one<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
doesn't work anymore and one of the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.609 
doesn't work anymore and one of the
reasons<00:01:48.759> why<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:49.060> doesn't<00:01:49.420> work<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.929> because

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
reasons why that doesn't work is because

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.070 
reasons why that doesn't work is because
of<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.950> biological<00:01:51.369> phenomenon<00:01:52.080> called

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
of a biological phenomenon called

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.999 
of a biological phenomenon called
adaptive<00:01:53.770> thermogenesis<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.380> adaptive

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
adaptive thermogenesis so adaptive

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.430 
adaptive thermogenesis so adaptive
thermogenesis<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.910> essentially<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
thermogenesis is essentially the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.230 
thermogenesis is essentially the
scientific<00:02:00.099> term<00:02:00.280> for<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.819> weight<00:02:01.060> loss

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
scientific term for a weight loss

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.380 
scientific term for a weight loss
plateau<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:02.080> now<00:02:02.920> what's<00:02:03.160> happened<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:04.179> your

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
plateau and now what's happened is your

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.029 
plateau and now what's happened is your
body<00:02:04.630> has<00:02:04.899> just<00:02:04.929> become<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.740> lot<00:02:05.979> more

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
body has just become a lot more

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.139 
body has just become a lot more
efficient<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.209> it's<00:02:07.479> adapted<00:02:08.140> right<00:02:09.099> now<00:02:09.550> one

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
efficient so it's adapted right now one

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.979 
efficient so it's adapted right now one
of<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.330> things<00:02:10.479> that's<00:02:10.599> really<00:02:10.780> interesting

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
of the things that's really interesting

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.530 
of the things that's really interesting
about<00:02:11.500> adaptive<00:02:12.310> thermogenesis<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
about adaptive thermogenesis and the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.449 
about adaptive thermogenesis and the
science<00:02:13.930> behind<00:02:13.959> weight<00:02:14.410> loss<00:02:14.590> plateaus<00:02:15.069> is

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
science behind weight loss plateaus is

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.390 
science behind weight loss plateaus is
let's<00:02:16.360> say<00:02:16.540> when<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.500> lose<00:02:17.709> weight<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.250> let's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
let's say when you lose weight so let's

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
let's say when you lose weight so let's
say<00:02:18.520> you've<00:02:18.700> lost<00:02:18.730> your<00:02:19.120> 50<00:02:19.360> pounds<00:02:19.720> right<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
say you've lost your 50 pounds right so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.800 
say you've lost your 50 pounds right so
from<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.160> mathematical<00:02:21.370> perspective<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.720> would

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
from a mathematical perspective we would

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.240 
from a mathematical perspective we would
expect<00:02:23.140> your<00:02:23.319> calorie<00:02:23.709> needs<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:24.130> be

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
expect your calorie needs to be

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.059 
expect your calorie needs to be
decreased<00:02:24.700> by<00:02:25.000> say<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:26.260> know<00:02:26.319> by<00:02:26.530> X<00:02:26.770> we're

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
decreased by say you know by X we're

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.030 
decreased by say you know by X we're
just<00:02:27.190> going<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.340> say<00:02:27.459> 10%<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:29.040> you're

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
just going to say 10% because you're

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.210 
just going to say 10% because you're
lighter<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.849> expect<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.630> 10%<00:02:32.290> reduction<00:02:32.440> in

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
lighter so you expect a 10% reduction in

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.940 
lighter so you expect a 10% reduction in
your<00:02:33.489> calorie<00:02:33.910> needs<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> reduce<00:02:35.409> your

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
your calorie needs so you reduce your

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.339 
your calorie needs so you reduce your
calories<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:37.239> know<00:02:37.360> additional<00:02:37.659> 10%

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
calories that you know additional 10%

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.800 
calories that you know additional 10%
and<00:02:39.099> you<00:02:39.219> should<00:02:39.370> start<00:02:39.579> losing<00:02:39.730> weight<00:02:40.030> again

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
and you should start losing weight again

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.760 
and you should start losing weight again
but<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> problem<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> over<00:02:42.160> here<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:44.650> get

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
but the problem is over here you get

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.000 
but the problem is over here you get
this<00:02:45.010> other<00:02:45.220> sort<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.930> phantom<00:02:46.930> 10%<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.920> you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
this other sort of phantom 10% that you

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.920 
this other sort of phantom 10% that you
don't<00:02:48.220> know<00:02:48.700> exists<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.540> usually<00:02:49.810> don't

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
don't know exists and we usually don't

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.690 
don't know exists and we usually don't
account<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:52.319> extra<00:02:53.319> reduction<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.550> your

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
account for this extra reduction in your

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300 
account for this extra reduction in your
daily<00:02:54.910> calorie<00:02:55.660> caloric<00:02:56.170> expenditure<00:02:56.319> is

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
daily calorie caloric expenditure is

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.520 
daily calorie caloric expenditure is
adaptive<00:02:57.910> thermogenesis<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.349> what

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
adaptive thermogenesis and now what

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.860 
adaptive thermogenesis and now what
drives<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.340> sort<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.150> an<00:03:01.300> evolutionary

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
drives it is sort of an evolutionary

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.559 
drives it is sort of an evolutionary
response<00:03:02.349> by<00:03:02.560> your<00:03:02.709> body<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.670> maintain

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
response by your body to maintain

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.920 
response by your body to maintain
homeostasis<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.830> conserve<00:03:06.310> energy<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.720> so

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
homeostasis and conserve energy and so

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.050 
homeostasis and conserve energy and so
partly<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:08.800> happens<00:03:09.250> especially<00:03:09.640> because

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
partly this happens especially because

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.449 
partly this happens especially because
of<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:11.440> know<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> great<00:03:11.800> example<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.250> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
of you know a great example of the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.710 
of you know a great example of the
running<00:03:12.760> you've<00:03:12.910> been<00:03:13.030> doing<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.330> aerobic

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
running you've been doing with aerobic

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.780 
running you've been doing with aerobic
exercise<00:03:14.200> his<00:03:14.830> research<00:03:15.280> shows<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.700> you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
exercise his research shows that you

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.410 
exercise his research shows that you
actually<00:03:16.360> get<00:03:16.569> increased<00:03:17.200> muscle<00:03:17.530> efficiency

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
actually get increased muscle efficiency

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.059 
actually get increased muscle efficiency
so<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.630> amount<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.959> calories<00:03:20.230> used<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.890> burn

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
so the amount of calories used to burn

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.120 
so the amount of calories used to burn
like<00:03:21.370> let's<00:03:21.580> say<00:03:21.700> used<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.060> burn<00:03:22.620> 300<00:03:23.620> calories

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
like let's say used to burn 300 calories

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.670 
like let's say used to burn 300 calories
running<00:03:24.610> those<00:03:24.819> three<00:03:25.090> miles<00:03:25.410> now<00:03:26.410> may<00:03:26.650> be

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
running those three miles now may be

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.910 
running those three miles now may be
your<00:03:26.860> only<00:03:27.040> burning<00:03:27.310> 250<00:03:28.299> calories<00:03:28.650> right<00:03:29.650> so

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
your only burning 250 calories right so

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.680 
your only burning 250 calories right so
your<00:03:30.040> muscles<00:03:30.250> have<00:03:30.580> gotten<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.150> efficient

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
your muscles have gotten more efficient

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.600 
your muscles have gotten more efficient
at<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.959> activity<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.650> you're<00:03:33.160> burning<00:03:33.459> less

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
at that activity so you're burning less

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.670 
at that activity so you're burning less
calories<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.599> it's<00:03:34.720> not<00:03:34.870> as<00:03:35.110> an<00:03:35.230> effective

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
calories so it's not as an effective

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.750 
calories so it's not as an effective
weight<00:03:36.160> loss<00:03:36.190> tool<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:39.160> we<00:03:39.280> need<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.489> do

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
weight loss tool so what we need to do

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.589 
weight loss tool so what we need to do
here<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.599> we<00:03:40.810> need<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.080> increase<00:03:41.500> your<00:03:42.599> total

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
here is we need to increase your total

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.900 
here is we need to increase your total
calorie<00:03:43.930> burning<00:03:44.200> right<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:45.160> before<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:45.670> have

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
calorie burning right so before we have

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.550 
calorie burning right so before we have
this<00:03:46.030> increased<00:03:46.450> muscle<00:03:46.630> efficiency<00:03:47.260> we<00:03:47.410> have

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
this increased muscle efficiency we have

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.800 
this increased muscle efficiency we have
to<00:03:47.680> find<00:03:47.859> a<00:03:47.950> way<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.310> rid<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:49.480> get

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
to find a way to get rid of that to get

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.170 
to find a way to get rid of that to get
your<00:03:49.930> total<00:03:50.290> calorie<00:03:50.650> burn<00:03:50.829> back<00:03:51.100> up<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:52.030> we're

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
your total calorie burn back up so we're

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.000 
your total calorie burn back up so we're
really<00:03:52.390> looking<00:03:52.630> at<00:03:52.989> activities<00:03:53.680> there<00:03:53.859> to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
really looking at activities there to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.160 
really looking at activities there to
enhance<00:03:54.220> metabolism<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.390> burn<00:03:56.019> more

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
enhance metabolism and burn more

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.289 
enhance metabolism and burn more
calories<00:03:56.880> oftentimes<00:03:57.880> with<00:03:58.000> weight<00:03:58.120> loss

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
calories oftentimes with weight loss

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.650 
calories oftentimes with weight loss
plateaus<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.079> answer<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.620> not<00:03:59.829> to<00:04:00.220> say<00:04:01.030> do

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
plateaus the answer is not to say do

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.370 
plateaus the answer is not to say do
more<00:04:01.989> sum<00:04:02.650> up<00:04:02.829> this<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.430> say<00:04:03.640> 8<00:04:04.299> miles<00:04:04.690> that's

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
more sum up this to say 8 miles that's

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.930 
more sum up this to say 8 miles that's
not<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.709> answer<00:04:06.040> because<00:04:06.670> you'll<00:04:06.819> just

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
not the answer because you'll just

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.210 
not the answer because you'll just
further<00:04:07.209> adapt<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.810> them<00:04:07.959> cuz<00:04:08.650> usually<00:04:08.859> the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
further adapt to them cuz usually the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.800 
further adapt to them cuz usually the
answer<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:09.549> people<00:04:09.819> have<00:04:10.000> let's<00:04:10.239> say<00:04:10.359> move

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
answer that people have let's say move

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.870 
answer that people have let's say move
back<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.139> 8<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.889> let's<00:04:12.100> cut<00:04:12.280> calories<00:04:12.519> even

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
back to 8 and let's cut calories even

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.940 
back to 8 and let's cut calories even
more<00:04:13.239> excuse<00:04:14.200> me<00:04:14.319> so<00:04:14.440> we<00:04:14.500> can<00:04:14.560> crave<00:04:14.799> that

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
more excuse me so we can crave that

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.800 
more excuse me so we can crave that
greater<00:04:15.220> deficit<00:04:15.730> but<00:04:16.329> that's<00:04:16.510> not<00:04:16.660> the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
greater deficit but that's not the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.420 
greater deficit but that's not the
answer<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.139> this<00:04:17.260> solution<00:04:17.530> because<00:04:18.130> you're

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
answer in this solution because you're

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.789 
answer in this solution because you're
just<00:04:18.579> gonna<00:04:18.729> adapt<00:04:19.120> more<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.900> this<00:04:20.079> case<00:04:20.350> if<00:04:20.620> we

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
just gonna adapt more in this case if we

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.710 
just gonna adapt more in this case if we
cut<00:04:21.039> calories<00:04:21.489> even<00:04:21.639> more<00:04:22.000> it's<00:04:22.570> gonna

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
cut calories even more it's gonna

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960 
cut calories even more it's gonna
further<00:04:23.169> drive<00:04:23.620> home<00:04:24.039> that<00:04:24.310> need<00:04:24.610> for<00:04:24.850> your

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
further drive home that need for your

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.110 
further drive home that need for your
body<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.479> become<00:04:25.630> more<00:04:26.139> efficient<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.580> what<00:04:28.000> we

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
body to become more efficient so what we

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.460 
body to become more efficient so what we
do<00:04:28.300> want<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.510> do<00:04:28.660> is<00:04:28.780> we<00:04:28.900> don't<00:04:29.139> want<00:04:29.260> to

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
do want to do is we don't want to

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.960 
do want to do is we don't want to
increase<00:04:29.830> calorie<00:04:30.280> burn<00:04:30.460> through<00:04:30.729> more

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
increase calorie burn through more

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.330 
increase calorie burn through more
running<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.510> eating<00:04:32.169> less<00:04:32.289> calories<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.190> get

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
running and eating less calories to get

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.909 
running and eating less calories to get
that<00:04:33.490> greater<00:04:33.669> deficit<00:04:34.210> instead<00:04:35.110> these<00:04:35.740> are

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
that greater deficit instead these are

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.440 
that greater deficit instead these are
the<00:04:36.070> three<00:04:36.310> things<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.729> recommend<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.300> do

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
the three things that I recommend you do

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.350 
the three things that I recommend you do
the<00:04:38.410> first<00:04:38.680> thing<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.880> switch<00:04:40.150> to

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
the first thing is to switch to

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.450 
the first thing is to switch to
resistance<00:04:40.750> training<00:04:41.220> resistance<00:04:42.220> training

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
resistance training resistance training

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.640 
resistance training resistance training
is<00:04:42.789> much<00:04:43.120> harder<00:04:43.539> for<00:04:43.690> your<00:04:43.900> body<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.320> adapt<00:04:44.620> to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
is much harder for your body to adapt to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.159 
is much harder for your body to adapt to

the next thing you want to do is trade

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.040 
the next thing you want to do is trade
in<00:05:32.410> your<00:05:33.190> aerobic<00:05:33.910> runs<00:05:34.360> for<00:05:35.080> interval<00:05:35.470> cardio

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
in your aerobic runs for interval cardio

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
in your aerobic runs for interval cardio
interval<00:05:38.050> cardio<00:05:38.200> again<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.830> going<00:05:38.950> to<00:05:39.010> be

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
interval cardio again is going to be

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.980 
interval cardio again is going to be
very<00:05:39.310> hard<00:05:39.670> for<00:05:39.880> your<00:05:40.000> body<00:05:40.030> to<00:05:40.330> adapt<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.600> and

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
very hard for your body to adapt to and

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.530 
very hard for your body to adapt to and
it's<00:05:41.080> very<00:05:41.170> metabolically<00:05:41.740> demanding<00:05:42.640> so

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
it's very metabolically demanding so

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.750 
it's very metabolically demanding so
something<00:05:44.050> an<00:05:44.170> example<00:05:44.650> would<00:05:44.740> be<00:05:44.800> say<00:05:45.250> 60

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
something an example would be say 60

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.020 
something an example would be say 60
seconds<00:05:46.270> of<00:05:47.170> hard<00:05:47.890> exercise<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.670> you're<00:05:48.760> going

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
seconds of hard exercise so you're going

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.170 
seconds of hard exercise so you're going
really<00:05:49.420> intense<00:05:49.780> for<00:05:49.960> 60<00:05:50.290> seconds<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:50.890> then

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
really intense for 60 seconds and then

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.770 
really intense for 60 seconds and then
90<00:05:52.180> to<00:05:52.360> 120<00:05:52.990> seconds<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.590> recovery<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.780> want

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
90 to 120 seconds of recovery you want

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.810 
90 to 120 seconds of recovery you want
to<00:05:55.870> do<00:05:55.990> this<00:05:56.140> you<00:05:56.680> want<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.860> say<00:05:57.070> five<00:05:57.400> rounds

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
to do this you want to say five rounds

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.750 
to do this you want to say five rounds
of<00:05:57.940> that<00:05:58.090> and<00:05:58.390> then<00:05:58.840> every<00:05:59.290> week<00:05:59.580> increase<00:06:00.580> the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
of that and then every week increase the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.210 
of that and then every week increase the
number<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.060> intervals<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:01.600> do<00:06:01.810> by<00:06:02.260> one<00:06:02.560> so<00:06:03.100> at

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
number of intervals you do by one so at

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.620 
number of intervals you do by one so at
the<00:06:03.310> end<00:06:03.400> of<00:06:03.550> four<00:06:03.760> weeks<00:06:03.790> you're<00:06:04.180> doing<00:06:04.420> eight

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
the end of four weeks you're doing eight

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.600 
the end of four weeks you're doing eight
intervals<00:06:05.110> and<00:06:05.740> you<00:06:05.800> want<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.070> bookend<00:06:06.370> this

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
intervals and you want to bookend this

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.100 
intervals and you want to bookend this
by<00:06:06.970> say<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:08.940> five<00:06:09.940> minute<00:06:10.270> warm-up<00:06:10.450> and<00:06:10.750> a<00:06:10.900> five

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
by say a five minute warm-up and a five

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.620 
by say a five minute warm-up and a five
minute<00:06:11.440> cooldown

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
minute cooldown

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.120 
minute cooldown
then<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.810> last<00:06:13.990> thing<00:06:14.260> I<00:06:14.350> want<00:06:14.530> you<00:06:14.620> to<00:06:14.680> do<00:06:14.830> is

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
then the last thing I want you to do is

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.920 
then the last thing I want you to do is
to<00:06:15.490> increase<00:06:15.940> your<00:06:16.120> total<00:06:16.390> protein<00:06:16.870> intake

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
to increase your total protein intake

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.920 
to increase your total protein intake
and<00:06:17.410> then<00:06:18.040> decrease<00:06:18.520> your<00:06:18.670> carbohydrates<00:06:19.330> but

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
and then decrease your carbohydrates but

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.960 
and then decrease your carbohydrates but
do<00:06:20.140> it<00:06:20.290> such<00:06:20.560> that<00:06:20.590> initially<00:06:21.310> you're<00:06:21.550> keeping

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
do it such that initially you're keeping

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.660 
do it such that initially you're keeping
calorie<00:06:22.360> is<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:22.660> same<00:06:22.900> so<00:06:23.890> by<00:06:24.040> increasing

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
calorie is the same so by increasing

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.090 
calorie is the same so by increasing
your<00:06:24.700> protein<00:06:25.150> intake<00:06:25.420> we're<00:06:26.140> gonna<00:06:26.260> slightly

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
your protein intake we're gonna slightly

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.650 
your protein intake we're gonna slightly
increase<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.880> total<00:06:28.060> calories<00:06:28.510> you're

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
increase the total calories you're

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.790 
increase the total calories you're
burning<00:06:28.690> through<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.110> thermic<00:06:29.440> effect<00:06:29.530> of

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
burning through the thermic effect of

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.640 
burning through the thermic effect of
food<00:06:30.180> digesting<00:06:31.180> protein<00:06:31.600> causes<00:06:32.530> you<00:06:32.620> to

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
food digesting protein causes you to

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.130 
food digesting protein causes you to
burn<00:06:32.890> more<00:06:32.920> calories<00:06:33.340> than<00:06:34.330> digesting

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
burn more calories than digesting

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.290 
burn more calories than digesting
carbohydrates<00:06:35.710> or<00:06:35.860> fats<00:06:36.100> and<00:06:36.400> then<00:06:37.180> we're

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
carbohydrates or fats and then we're

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.150 
carbohydrates or fats and then we're
going<00:06:37.420> to<00:06:37.450> decrease<00:06:37.930> your<00:06:38.350> carbohydrate<00:06:39.010> so

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
going to decrease your carbohydrate so

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.460 
going to decrease your carbohydrate so
this<00:06:39.340> is<00:06:39.460> gonna<00:06:39.580> be<00:06:39.670> specifically<00:06:40.470> say

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
this is gonna be specifically say

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:47.160 
this is gonna be specifically say
through<00:06:41.770> grains<00:06:42.100> and<00:06:42.550> starches<00:06:45.780> breads<00:06:46.780> rice

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
through grains and starches breads rice

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.260 
through grains and starches breads rice
pasta<00:06:47.680> etc<00:06:48.100> and<00:06:48.580> then<00:06:48.700> you're<00:06:48.820> gonna<00:06:48.910> eat<00:06:49.060> more

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
pasta etc and then you're gonna eat more

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.510 
pasta etc and then you're gonna eat more
green<00:06:49.720> leafy<00:06:50.050> vegetables<00:06:50.530> so<00:06:51.220> you're<00:06:51.430> gonna

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
green leafy vegetables so you're gonna

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.250 
green leafy vegetables so you're gonna
feel<00:06:51.880> like<00:06:52.120> you're<00:06:52.270> actually<00:06:52.450> eating<00:06:52.750> a<00:06:53.080> lot

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
feel like you're actually eating a lot

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.230 
feel like you're actually eating a lot
more<00:06:53.500> food<00:06:53.770> by<00:06:54.280> trading<00:06:54.790> out<00:06:54.910> some<00:06:55.120> of<00:06:55.180> the

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
more food by trading out some of the

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.080 
more food by trading out some of the
carbohydrates<00:06:55.540> you're<00:06:55.960> doing<00:06:56.640> so<00:06:57.640> after<00:06:58.000> you

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
carbohydrates you're doing so after you

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.790 
carbohydrates you're doing so after you
make<00:06:58.150> this<00:06:58.390> dietary<00:06:58.930> change<00:06:59.230> and<00:06:59.560> you<00:06:59.650> make

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
make this dietary change and you make

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.030 
make this dietary change and you make
these<00:07:00.100> other<00:07:01.050> exercise<00:07:02.050> changes<00:07:02.620> you<00:07:03.010> should

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
these other exercise changes you should

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.560 
these other exercise changes you should
see<00:07:03.310> your<00:07:03.430> weight<00:07:03.550> loss<00:07:03.760> jump<00:07:04.060> start<00:07:04.330> again

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
see your weight loss jump start again

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.540 
see your weight loss jump start again
and<00:07:04.840> then<00:07:05.440> after<00:07:05.740> a<00:07:05.770> while<00:07:05.800> if<00:07:06.130> it<00:07:06.250> slows<00:07:06.520> down

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
and then after a while if it slows down

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.830 
and then after a while if it slows down
you<00:07:07.540> can<00:07:07.690> you

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
you can you

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.930 
you can you
they're<00:07:08.020> at<00:07:08.290> another<00:07:09.220> interval<00:07:09.610> training

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
they're at another interval training

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.360 
they're at another interval training
session<00:07:10.330> or<00:07:10.480> we<00:07:10.810> can<00:07:10.930> start<00:07:11.110> look<00:07:11.320> at<00:07:11.500> slowly

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
session or we can start look at slowly

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.960 
session or we can start look at slowly
reducing<00:07:13.060> calories<00:07:13.240> if<00:07:13.630> I<00:07:13.720> say<00:07:14.010> 250<00:07:15.010> calories

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:15.970 
reducing calories if I say 250 calories

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.939 
reducing calories if I say 250 calories
per<00:07:16.360> day<00:07:16.389> but<00:07:16.930> no<00:07:17.110> more<00:07:17.380> than<00:07:17.440> that

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949 
per day but no more than that

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:19.980 
per day but no more than that
we<00:07:18.250> want<00:07:18.400> to<00:07:18.490> do<00:07:18.580> as<00:07:18.699> much<00:07:18.880> as<00:07:19.060> we<00:07:19.180> can<00:07:19.389> to

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
we want to do as much as we can to

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.770 
we want to do as much as we can to
increase<00:07:20.290> your<00:07:20.710> calorie<00:07:21.100> burning<00:07:21.520> to<00:07:22.389> make

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.780 
increase your calorie burning to make

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.140 
increase your calorie burning to make
that<00:07:22.960> deficit<00:07:23.470> between<00:07:23.669> calories<00:07:24.669> and<00:07:24.850> versus

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
that deficit between calories and versus

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.390 
that deficit between calories and versus
calories<00:07:25.360> out<00:07:25.630> instead<00:07:26.260> of<00:07:26.440> reducing<00:07:27.040> getting

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
calories out instead of reducing getting

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.850 
calories out instead of reducing getting
that<00:07:27.520> deficit<00:07:27.910> from<00:07:28.000> reducing<00:07:28.600> calories<00:07:28.860> so

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
that deficit from reducing calories so

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.020 
that deficit from reducing calories so
these<00:07:30.010> are<00:07:30.160> the<00:07:30.250> three<00:07:30.460> things<00:07:30.669> you<00:07:30.790> want<00:07:30.910> to

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 
these are the three things you want to

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.770 
these are the three things you want to
do<00:07:32.040> would<00:07:33.040> say<00:07:33.280> congratulations<00:07:34.150> on<00:07:34.270> that<00:07:34.389> 50

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
do would say congratulations on that 50

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.590 
do would say congratulations on that 50
pound<00:07:35.020> weight<00:07:35.110> loss<00:07:35.260> and<00:07:35.860> really<00:07:36.699> you<00:07:36.880> know<00:07:36.970> if

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
pound weight loss and really you know if

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.140 
pound weight loss and really you know if
you<00:07:37.750> dig<00:07:37.990> in<00:07:38.139> here<00:07:38.500> increase<00:07:39.370> intensity

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 
you dig in here increase intensity

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.050 
you dig in here increase intensity
remember<00:07:40.770> intensity<00:07:41.770> is<00:07:41.950> always<00:07:42.370> better<00:07:42.669> than

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.060 
remember intensity is always better than

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.969 
remember intensity is always better than
more<00:07:43.300> duration<00:07:43.840> or<00:07:44.080> intensity<00:07:44.530> is<00:07:44.740> better

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:44.979 
more duration or intensity is better

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:46.650 
more duration or intensity is better
than<00:07:45.160> more<00:07:45.310> duration<00:07:45.820> when<00:07:46.240> it<00:07:46.330> comes<00:07:46.540> to

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660 
than more duration when it comes to

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.750 
than more duration when it comes to
exercise<00:07:46.780> so<00:07:47.680> increase<00:07:48.010> your<00:07:48.190> intensity<00:07:48.639> of

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760 
exercise so increase your intensity of

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.340 
exercise so increase your intensity of
your<00:07:48.850> exercise<00:07:49.300> and<00:07:49.870> you<00:07:49.960> should<00:07:50.110> get<00:07:50.200> your

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350 
your exercise and you should get your

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.750 
your exercise and you should get your
weight<00:07:50.500> loss<00:07:50.860> plateau<00:07:51.280> you<00:07:51.340> should<00:07:51.550> build<00:07:51.669> a
