mini-map this time we're using the voxel

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
mini-map this time we're using the voxel
map<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.480> voxel<00:02:12.840> map<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.140> available

season<00:06:14.790> 6<00:06:15.000> I'm<00:06:15.150> actually<00:06:15.270> gonna<00:06:15.510> wait<00:06:15.810> for<00:06:16.260> 1.6

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
season 6 I'm actually gonna wait for 1.6

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.550 
season 6 I'm actually gonna wait for 1.6
I<00:06:17.310> don't<00:06:18.150> know<00:06:18.390> how<00:06:19.050> long<00:06:19.170> it's<00:06:19.380> gonna<00:06:19.440> take

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
I don't know how long it's gonna take

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.050 
I don't know how long it's gonna take
for<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.890> mods<00:06:20.040> to<00:06:20.160> get<00:06:20.280> updated<00:06:20.550> but<00:06:20.820> I<00:06:20.850> don't

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
for the mods to get updated but I don't

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.730 
for the mods to get updated but I don't
think<00:06:21.150> it's<00:06:21.300> gonna<00:06:21.420> be<00:06:21.570> that<00:06:21.840> long<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:22.620> I<00:06:22.650> think

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
think it's gonna be that long so I think

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.680 
think it's gonna be that long so I think
it's<00:06:22.950> probably<00:06:23.310> worthwhile<00:06:23.730> to<00:06:24.240> go<00:06:24.360> ahead<00:06:24.450> and

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
it's probably worthwhile to go ahead and

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.350 
it's probably worthwhile to go ahead and
just<00:06:24.840> wait<00:06:25.140> for<00:06:25.530> 1.6<00:06:26.040> before<00:06:26.610> I<00:06:26.640> start<00:06:26.970> season

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
just wait for 1.6 before I start season

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.930 
just wait for 1.6 before I start season
