exactly<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> new<00:00:32.759> fishing<00:00:33.120> system<00:00:33.540> works

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
exactly how the new fishing system works

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.030 
exactly how the new fishing system works
because<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.290> means<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.800> stuff<00:00:35.010> like

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
because it means you can get stuff like

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
because it means you can get stuff like
name<00:00:35.460> tags<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:35.910> well<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.390> rare<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> fish<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
some point you eventually get you know

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
some point you eventually get you know
your<00:00:59.579> raw<00:00:59.820> fish<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.109> pretty

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
your raw fish like this and it's pretty

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
your raw fish like this and it's pretty
simple<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.219> boring<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.329> it's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
simple but it's very boring like it's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
simple but it's very boring like it's
it's<00:01:03.719> usually<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.260> worth<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.589> time<00:01:04.680> unless

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it's usually not worth your time unless

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's usually not worth your time unless
you're<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.610> starving<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.320> put

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you're really starving to actually put

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.170 
you're really starving to actually put
your<00:01:07.590> fishing<00:01:07.920> rod<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> water<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.670> yeah

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
your fishing rod in the water and yeah

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
your fishing rod in the water and yeah
just<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.720> worth<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.020> time<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.799> not

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
just not really worth your time it's not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100 
just not really worth your time it's not
something<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:11.970> often<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
something you do very often but this

new fishing fish types they're
introduced<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.259> range<00:01:25.560> from<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
introduced to this which range from just

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.109 
introduced to this which range from just
being<00:01:25.979> better<00:01:26.250> than<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.880> more

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
being better than this like more

which<00:01:29.369> i<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:29.850> cool<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.570> on

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
which i think is really cool and then on

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
which i think is really cool and then on
top<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.930> there's<00:01:31.290> also<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.799> chance<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
top of that there's also the chance to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.120 
top of that there's also the chance to
get<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:32.759> drops<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.420> aren't<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.960> know

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
get different drops that aren't you know

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
get different drops that aren't you know
aren't<00:01:35.130> fishes<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.520> all<00:01:35.610> which<00:01:35.729> i<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:35.909> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
aren't fishes at all which i think is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.630 
aren't fishes at all which i think is
really<00:01:36.270> cool<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.720> yeah<00:01:37.350> i'll<00:01:37.560> explain<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.189> or

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
really cool so yeah i'll explain this or

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.789 
really cool so yeah i'll explain this or
hoping<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.390> shall<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.869> basically<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
hoping now then shall we so basically in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
hoping now then shall we so basically in
the<00:01:40.920> purpose<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> game<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.729> pitch<00:01:41.970> drops

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the purpose of the game it's pitch drops

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
the purpose of the game it's pitch drops
into<00:01:42.540> free<00:01:42.899> categories<00:01:43.560> there's<00:01:43.770> fish<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
into free categories there's fish this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
into free categories there's fish this
is<00:01:44.759> most<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> go

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is most of what you get when you go

is most of what you get when you go
fishing<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:46.710> 85%<00:01:47.610> full<00:01:47.729> drops<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.329> every<00:01:48.570> time

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
fishing at 85% full drops so every time

know the fish we know and love is the
most<00:01:57.509> common<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.140> you've<00:01:58.259> also<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:58.560> a

most common but then you've also got a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.170 
most common but then you've also got a
chance<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> getting<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.460> clownfish<00:02:00.000> of

which<00:02:02.280> I'll<00:02:02.399> explain<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.700> things<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
which I'll explain all things in a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
which I'll explain all things in a
second<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:03.960> now<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.079> bear<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.469> mind

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
second but for now just bear in mind

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
second but for now just bear in mind
85%<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.579> their<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.850> drops<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.450> fish

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
85% of their your drops will be fish

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.619 
85% of their your drops will be fish
then<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.310> junk<00:02:08.670> category<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
then we have the junk category so this

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.380 
then we have the junk category so this
is<00:02:09.869> 10%<00:02:10.530> shot<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.430> 10<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:12.270> know

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
is 10% shot so one in 10 you know

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730 
is 10% shot so one in 10 you know
fishing<00:02:12.690> lines<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.050> put<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.349> one<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.590> them

the other types of fish in the epitopes
thing<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.560> first<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.890> all<00:04:22.979> there's<00:04:23.610> three

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
thing so first of all there's three

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.400 
thing so first of all there's three
types<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.120> free<00:04:24.660> brand<00:04:24.900> new<00:04:24.990> types<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.290> fish

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
types of free brand new types of fish

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.659 
types of free brand new types of fish
they<00:04:25.590> come<00:04:25.710> one<00:04:25.830> for<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.040> what<00:04:26.430> do<00:04:26.550> these

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
they come one for this what do these

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.650 
they come one for this what do these
other<00:04:26.850> types<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.150> fish<00:04:27.330> do

other types of fish do
and<00:04:27.780> what<00:04:28.020> what<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.530> all<00:04:28.740> about<00:04:28.770> you

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
and what what is this all about you

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.710 
and what what is this all about you
might<00:04:29.280> be<00:04:29.370> wondering<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.850> first<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.420> all<00:04:30.540> let's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
might be wondering so first of all let's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.840 
might be wondering so first of all let's
talk<00:04:30.930> about<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.590> salmon<00:04:32.070> fish<00:04:32.520> because<00:04:32.730> it's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
talk about the salmon fish because it's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.670 
talk about the salmon fish because it's
the<00:04:32.940> easiest<00:04:33.210> one<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.480> explain<00:04:33.810> salmon<00:04:34.500> is

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
the easiest one to explain salmon is

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.260 
the easiest one to explain salmon is
slightly<00:04:35.280> less<00:04:35.520> common<00:04:35.820> than<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.970> regular

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
slightly less common than the regular

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.760 
slightly less common than the regular
fish<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.810> basically<00:04:37.140> will<00:04:37.380> fill<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.740> up

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
fish and it basically will fill you up

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.800 
fish and it basically will fill you up
more<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.670> once<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.090> cook<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.420> instead<00:04:39.690> of

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
more is that once you cook it instead of

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.330 
more is that once you cook it instead of
giving<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.530> know<00:04:40.620> two<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.920> half<00:04:41.070> erm

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
giving you a you know two and a half erm

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.800 
giving you a you know two and a half erm
hunger<00:04:41.640> bars<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.120> gives<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.360> free<00:04:42.570> hunger

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
hunger bars it gives you free hunger

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.270 
hunger bars it gives you free hunger
bars<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.350> gives<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.620> more<00:04:43.770> saturation

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
bars and it gives you more saturation

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.710 
bars and it gives you more saturation
almost<00:04:44.730> as<00:04:44.850> much<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.150> golden<00:04:45.390> carrot<00:04:45.570> I

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
almost as much the golden carrot I

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.420 
almost as much the golden carrot I
believe<00:04:45.960> which<00:04:46.140> is<00:04:46.260> pretty<00:04:46.410> cool<00:04:46.620> then<00:04:47.310> we

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
believe which is pretty cool then we

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.160 
believe which is pretty cool then we
have<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.700> clownfish<00:04:48.120> which<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.480> just<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.810> super

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
have the clownfish which is just a super

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.160 
have the clownfish which is just a super
rare<00:04:49.530> chance<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.390> slaughter<00:04:51.780> it's

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
rare chance like it's a slaughter it's

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.450 
rare chance like it's a slaughter it's
roughly<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.650> same<00:04:52.860> chance<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.220> getting<00:04:53.430> a

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
roughly the same chance of getting a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.010 
roughly the same chance of getting a
clownfish<00:04:53.940> as<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.540> get<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> name

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
clownfish as it is to get like a name

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.840 
clownfish as it is to get like a name
tag<00:04:55.170> or<00:04:55.320> something<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:55.950> rare<00:04:56.250> chance<00:04:56.490> rev

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
tag or something so a rare chance rev

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.640 
tag or something so a rare chance rev
drop<00:04:57.150> fish<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.660> mainly<00:04:57.810> just<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.350> rare

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
drop fish but it's mainly just a rare

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.170 
drop fish but it's mainly just a rare
fish<00:04:58.950> like<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.370> won't<00:04:59.520> find<00:04:59.760> them<00:04:59.850> very<00:04:59.910> often

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
fish like you won't find them very often

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.210 
fish like you won't find them very often
it's<00:05:00.720> kind<00:05:01.080> of<00:05:01.170> cool<00:05:01.410> but<00:05:01.560> they<00:05:01.680> don't<00:05:01.890> do<00:05:02.010> too

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
it's kind of cool but they don't do too

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.950 
it's kind of cool but they don't do too
much<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.580> then<00:05:02.730> finally<00:05:03.120> we<00:05:03.450> have<00:05:03.660> the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
much and then finally we have the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.800 
much and then finally we have the
pufferfish<00:05:04.530> here<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.640> is<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:06.270> pretty

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
pufferfish here and this is a pretty

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.150 
pufferfish here and this is a pretty

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
these a lot of bows and a lot of fishing

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.860 
these a lot of bows and a lot of fishing
rods<00:06:05.340> which<00:06:05.669> i<00:06:05.790> think<00:06:05.850> is<00:06:06.090> really<00:06:06.419> cool<00:06:06.630> these

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
rods which i think is really cool these

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.320 
rods which i think is really cool these
will<00:06:07.260> always<00:06:07.410> these<00:06:07.890> two<00:06:08.070> things<00:06:08.280> here<00:06:08.400> will

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
will always these two things here will

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.670 
will always these two things here will
always<00:06:09.480> be<00:06:09.630> slightly<00:06:09.930> damaged<00:06:10.230> but<00:06:10.410> I<00:06:10.440> think

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
always be slightly damaged but I think

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.020 
always be slightly damaged but I think
the<00:06:10.770> enchantment<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.340> makes<00:06:11.610> up<00:06:11.760> for<00:06:11.910> that

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
the enchantment and makes up for that

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.909 
the enchantment and makes up for that
and<00:06:12.210> yeah<00:06:12.900> that's<00:06:13.110> kind<00:06:13.320> of<00:06:13.350> how<00:06:13.500> this<00:06:13.620> works

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
and yeah that's kind of how this works

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.430 
and yeah that's kind of how this works
so<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.640> new<00:06:14.760> fishing<00:06:15.060> system<00:06:15.540> is<00:06:15.690> really<00:06:16.080> cool

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
so the new fishing system is really cool

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.920 
so the new fishing system is really cool
I<00:06:16.770> really<00:06:17.520> really<00:06:18.210> like<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.600> and<00:06:18.660> I'm<00:06:18.750> really

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
I really really like it and I'm really

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.030 
I really really like it and I'm really
looking<00:06:19.080> forward<00:06:19.290> to<00:06:19.380> it<00:06:19.500> because<00:06:19.830> it<00:06:19.919> makes

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
looking forward to it because it makes

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.710 
looking forward to it because it makes
fishing<00:06:20.310> exciting<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.120> means<00:06:21.300> instead<00:06:21.510> of

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
fishing exciting it means instead of

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.210 
fishing exciting it means instead of
just<00:06:22.020> knowing<00:06:22.230> you'll<00:06:22.500> get<00:06:22.680> fish<00:06:22.950> which

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
just knowing you'll get fish which

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.890 
just knowing you'll get fish which
evidently<00:06:23.640> actually<00:06:23.970> might<00:06:24.150> be<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.300> video<00:06:24.630> so

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
evidently actually might be a video so

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.390 
evidently actually might be a video so
far<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.410> looks<00:06:25.530> like<00:06:25.860> I've<00:06:26.010> owned<00:06:26.100> beginning

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
far it looks like I've owned beginning

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.920 
far it looks like I've owned beginning
fishing<00:06:26.669> is<00:06:26.820> that<00:06:27.060> just<00:06:27.240> knowing<00:06:27.570> you'll<00:06:27.720> get

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930

getting other fishes which can do other
