00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
to bits

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.079 
to bits
but<00:05:12.559> it's<00:05:12.649> always<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.889> bit<00:05:13.039> embarrassing<00:05:13.550> to

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:14.089 
but it's always a bit embarrassing to

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:15.309 
but it's always a bit embarrassing to
not<00:05:14.330> do<00:05:14.479> that<00:05:14.599> today<00:05:14.779> when<00:05:14.990> actually<00:05:15.289> I

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
not do that today when actually I

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.659 
not do that today when actually I
probably<00:05:15.439> should<00:05:15.679> them<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.009> make<00:05:16.159> more<00:05:16.339> muscle

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
probably should them to make more muscle

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.029 
probably should them to make more muscle
