 fucking kaka touches tradition there 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.450
 takes away over the years and everyone gets 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.120
 they will always remember thanks 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.640
 these traditions progress point col 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.200
 de simone but the tradition is 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.600
 fundamental for example of half hand e 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.040
 who lets it escape and stay 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.050
 everyone joking about the convention 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.670

 when the band and Julio no half 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.400
 extraordinary we have our mini 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.410
 extraordinary micro crime and roads 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.030
 if the excitement of the snatching of 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.470
 euronics of the pur are things that do not 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.470
 they must disappear completely 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.660
 let's say the leitmotif of a plot 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.840
 cultural a plot of economic commitment 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.600
 a plot that had the horizon 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.600
 tourist and it is above all a plot that 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.970
 we have delivered to young people because here 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.919
 in grottaglie as in the whole puglia 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.560
 now this plot is woven and comes 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.020
 increasingly inspired by a spare part 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.780
 generational that has embraced with us 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.330
 this challenge and that is allowing 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.840
 record extraordinary performances on 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.600
 economic field in tourism and in 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.970
 field of identity pride that 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.169
 we have rediscovered and around this 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.600
 our plot 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.040
 we are trying to make it become 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.419
 increasingly a development perspective 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.419
 also for our young people 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.509
 plants this year we hit 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.189
 the goal is still waiting for us 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.179
 tomorrow to consolidate 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:02.049
 this result 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:04.719
 a format that pushes us to export 

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:06.519
 Abroad this all the 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:09.939
 Puglia puts excellence on the table 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:11.649
 pugliesi on the table in grottaglie is for 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.389
 next year a nice project too
