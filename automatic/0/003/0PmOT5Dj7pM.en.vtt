I tend to be a little bit dryer and
maybe<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.430> from<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.580> traveling<00:02:14.030> or<00:02:14.360> from

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
maybe it's from the traveling or from

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.510 
maybe it's from the traveling or from
where<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.020> live<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.710> like<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.160> add<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> little
