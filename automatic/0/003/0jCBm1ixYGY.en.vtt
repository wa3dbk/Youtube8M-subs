00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.410
 it is to be expected that the focus at Dubey on it light crime thriller blue 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.999
 Photoshop to work closer together 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.289
 and so it does not surprise me if I am now on a teenage placeholder 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.400
 double on it blanket 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.339
 that now has the opportunity «directly select Photoshop parties 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.460
 if we did our Hertha act out here 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.670
 click OK epd 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 and we now get the web for saving the locomotive with a preview image 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.960
 here i can now call him a genius bob team 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.810
 I can decide here first 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.260
 should have saved the whole in the foreign APEC format 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.970
 take any tablet format and maybe change the quality a bit 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.039
 Here it is still eleven kilos at COS 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.989
 And with the culprit quality at Erfurt she is already a bit too 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.860
 low always a bit higher 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 80 percent approximately 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.950
 so you can reasonably live with it 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.320
 If I now OK on the back corner then the picture will now be in place of the square 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.940
 Age inserted 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 Memory now measures in the pictures folder may close home and if it is here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 just down image 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.640
 Save Tecan 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.080
 the picture has now been added to my page 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.320
 What else could be seen is that we have the possibility down here 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.079
 edit the image directly with Photoshop 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.509
 So happy to work with Photoshop 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.750
 this is the picture 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.490
 as well as Gina Photoshop document what to expect 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.160
 opened in Photoshop 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.410
 now i can add here in the dome i would for example 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.800
 Hainer Parton saturation angel Bene insert and but the picture maybe 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 one time 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.730
 click on OK 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.160
 close and save the document 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.350
 who liked to be back to thrillers 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.260
 and Riverbed update the image now 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.760
 But there are also some other ways to take pictures between them 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.590
 Photoshop and how can exchange again then we drive the picture again 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.340
 what here 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.980
 At this point, we believe and believe in a new image from Photoshop 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.540
 by putting the appropriate page out of Photoshop he does not lie to me 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.460
 as an image in my website, however, is activated here with 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.240
 Kluck link provided it says the Photoshop has a work not on the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.300
 Web server loaded 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.319
 dpa double click to load the original document in Photoshop 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.099
 Now we go to exactly this section that we really like 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.739
 would like 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 and mark this and copies on the clipboard 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.929
 May out probably again short on normal 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.619
 No, now here my picture and just be a little less fun 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.869
 Edges here 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.719
 our 100 simply edit on one level reduces copying and her with it 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.099
 Now back to the Miba 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.700
 in Erfurt Kaesong has the place where we would like to insert the image 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.740
 and say here 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.349
 insert edit 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.310
 so that now again go dialogue image preview what I can say with 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.679
 which settings take the right picture 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.179
 click on OK 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.900
 and save the picture back in with Spartans also around Petra Pau 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.900
 next to units active text 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.609
 and the image is now placed directly on the web page 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.750
 also this picture 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.299
 can be changed at any time 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.040
 the interesting thing is the team rather simply the father for 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.459
 Orginal Photoshop file saves 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.589
 that means we have not only the Jailbreak ride but also the 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.989
 Photoshop party just like us up here 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.280
 for the picture have what we have inserted before also stores here 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.769
 Buemi was driving to Photoshop at the same time 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.579
 also in this picture can edit value say 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.040
 with Photoshop and that will in turn make our Photoshop file open in 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.579
 In the case I had arranged myself I will very close and ferment 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.949
 will also be over 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.529
 and now again to the picture and say 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.229
 for work with Photoshop 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.639
 Now my eye Naldo Command is opened again 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.100
 I can be upscale without changes to this picture 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.520
 and that may be the clipboard copying and then resubmitting to Photoshop 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.230
 on 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.650
 in that I worked with the selection 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.720
 of course I have no direct link to the Miba it is therefore 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.879
 smarter prefer to decorate the entire Photoshop file Zollverein 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.269
 as having to pass with the work of copying but for the fast 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:55.750
 Thing 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.750
 it is copy and paste really a very exciting story 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:05.239
 in pictures where I do not have any contact Photoshop file HP how to 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.780
 Example the poison here there are no source files 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.400
 I can still click on working with Photoshop 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.870
 only the original poison is shown to me I can change AG in the morning 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.040
 make 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.870
 and then just save back 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.359
 if we are here for example 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.210
 on Build and Orson the maybe brightness contrasts this picture 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.379
 optimize again 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.029
 Klöckner threw okay 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.219
 save the picture again 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.499
 and close it in Photoshop and like to be confident and see it now 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:34.509
 Game over here too 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.220
 has updated the picture 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.000
 on already placed pictures, they also have the possibility of some 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.490
 Make changes then 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.890
 For example, they can beat the picture or the picture 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.259
 only compressing noise can be optimized 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.779
 Dirk just to cut here 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.619
 So now I have the opportunity to add a new image section from the picture 

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:53.470
 Picture I just hit Return 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.190
 and the picture is cropped new 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.930
 Of course, this technique also works with Photoshop 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.080
 Documents that I could be on 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.820
 Click on it to click ok 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.529
 and define a section 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.179
 there I opened the picture to man right there anyway 

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:10.900
 of course the possibility here at any time 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.170
 to do an edit in Photoshop 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.660
 make change to save and go back to make a thriller 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.900
 just for web designers it's of course great thing 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.220
 that now the two programs Photoshop and thriller was so close together 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.720
 work
