00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hey people and welcome to mikes en 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.580
 suite today I'll tell you something 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 are sectional pictures and what you for them 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 needs cut pictures if in all 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.460
 possible videos or movies again and again 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 you already have used it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 a thousand times a million times 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 even if you do not know that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 are cut pictures or that you can do it that way 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.740
 This is also known as birol 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.060
 material for example because it is quite often 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.890
 with a second camera for example 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.620
 is currently being shot at the film 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.070
 because office because it's just the b camera 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.379
 today's still today 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 this name or just cut pictures 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.690
 or something and has very different 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 mission or reasons why you 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 actually, for example, you can do it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 Cover up the cut 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 quite often you know it for example when 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 you somehow look in interviews or 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.329
 so but is shown in the sectional picture 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 eg by the hands then you can use it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.039
 for example , in the middle of the interview 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 cut out and just with one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.240
 put another picture on it without that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.500
 audience that so much notice 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 if you can maybe tune it in 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 a little bit hears but then you have 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 For example, not this jump can not 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
 can set which one has just spoken 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.740
 but also the step for example 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.470
 loosen up 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.720
 by overlaying things about the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.820
 protagonist or old the person in front of the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.850
 Camera speaks for example when I am 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.439
 would now talk about the canon 550d 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 then you could now at this point 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 a cut picture from the camera 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.100
 Show the audience with it too 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.140
 Bild has what I'm talking about or when 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.070
 I, for example, as an actor or 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.049
 something in there look now and then 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.220
 Shipowner about what I see there or me 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.200
 just look there 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.210
 so that the audience knows where I am looking 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.659
 you make a cut picture of what 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 I sort of see the point of view 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.880
 variant of it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.600
 and so you can cut pictures for everything 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 possible uses also for example 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.590
 if there are two sequences of each other 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.780
 I turn on this spot for example 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.570
 and another spot would turn around 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.099
 not just with a direct one 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.670
 cut and then I am 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.040
 suddenly completely elsewhere 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.620
 so you can make a cut picture 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.410
 from for example grasses of a road 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.790
 a tree a bird what you stop 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.620
 right here for example here in the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.050
 near or maybe at the new one 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.120
 spot has close and so you relax 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.400
 the whole on so you prepare 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.380
 Example the audience open cut 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.380
 before open location change 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.120
 and then it's a bit gentler and 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.190
 not so drastic with just pip 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 Cut and I'm totally elsewhere for it 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.940
 but also quite often used 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.650
 but I also have a shot 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.600
 You can also find video made on one 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.760
 channel and I link you below 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.069
 in the video description so just so 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.840
 as for the location stories 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.730
 location ideas that's called 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.769
 then more protection than cut pictures 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.450
 cut images are more likely since a 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.549
 to lighten up the whole thing 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.410
 little things to show the the 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.410
 main camera for example not time 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.300
 I hope you understood what 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.200
 are sectional pictures and what you for them 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.400
 can use 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.410
 I would be at this place 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.480
 interest used cut pictures 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.610
 Really aware that here too 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.360
 if yes, please post in below 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.100
 the comments 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.200
 if a post also like in the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.700
 comments what you think about it or 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.920

 likes to write down and then link 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.660
 Also like to have a video of you where you 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.150
 what you think is a good example 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.260
 for your cut pictures otherwise hope 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.060
 I liked you and the video 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.800
 I have already said help but 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.540
 your free the channel and no video 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.190
 to miss more checks at the side 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.080
 the videos and see you 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.080
