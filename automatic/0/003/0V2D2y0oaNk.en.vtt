when<00:02:33.440> I'm<00:02:33.560> setting<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.099> so<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:35.030> really

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
when I'm setting it so that I can really

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
along because you want that trap to be

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.420 
along because you want that trap to be
bedded<00:02:44.659> solid<00:02:45.140> that's<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.829> other<00:02:45.950> reason

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
bedded solid that's the other reason

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670 
bedded solid that's the other reason
that<00:02:46.459> will<00:02:46.730> make<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> coyote<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.660> weigh<00:02:47.959> or<00:02:48.440> dig
