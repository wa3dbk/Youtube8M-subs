 I had previously done atrocious hotels but I had not uploaded them then it will be 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.599
 the first one to look 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.300
 and it will be busy simple this is to act following the fair measure is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.140
 and I got to do something professional in this good first is the first thing that 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.590
 we can do would be how color changes something in that case we could 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.540
 change spain herman from rough red and to do that 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.220
 we have April from baggage deserve 8 that image or the actress want but 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.620
 the value as an example the Spanish eat 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.800
 why what can you for this process is colored as an example this 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.920
 time to put together three are half black imitate red hilaria spain 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.990
 brother in his way 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.980
 when this black 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.090
 we place open this 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
 and how they see it is a bit with low quality 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.350
 does not exceed this 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 is something rules what we are going to do 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.920
 is let's change it to black 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.860
 once 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.120
 let us begin 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.650
 I know that I adored cup from the icons of down below we expect a new layer 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.660
 and we went through the selection of what we are here for when 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.820
 the face when we can start selecting them 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 with our with this choice 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 we select select 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.880
 this selection to everything and we select the j smaller ita the sheep worse 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.750
 I think it's already selected 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.690
 I think I passed the selection 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.700
 we press the key like this 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.140
 for what 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.330
 port of death select 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 we present and select 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.810
 but it seems clear is that the key 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.140
 art arq and we keep pressing we jump tissue the exquisite others finished 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.140
 to select and now what we are going to do 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.399
 we are not for what the top layer will look for 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.609
 we will install a paint pot with its black color 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.819
 I do not know what 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.929
 we quote and kobe the black cape is requested 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.929
 we go to aduriz is normal 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.829
 and of course that color 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.549
 as you can see 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.339
 I'm already 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.459
 yes I go black although no one takes the picture marc loans foals 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.589
 of promissory notes initiated 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:49.819
 and now what we're going to do this applies an abbas layer mask that rejects 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.879
 and now we married the era 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.109
 we'll see which ones with a little smaller diameter 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.669
 and we approach that purpose 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.669
 we can do it 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.289
 we can 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 had extra point as here we spend works 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.179
 the eyes a little smaller 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.619
 and we started this I'm not going to do it perfectly 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.949
 Since this is your only one ticket you can do it to the 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.369
 perfection 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.369
 after being like that 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 from it or more 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.729
 as I tell them that I will do it well because I know that only victory 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:42.759
 I expect it next 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.499
 and as a time 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.420
 those changes and it shows in front of this change and the Lord has done yet 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.049
 a little better quality 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.109
 now we're going to the other file ap insists exactly the same 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.849
 you can see what we can do pitas vitali pitas 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.419
 we select 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.569
 in its little easier 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.729
 we select 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:06.949
 and now 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.299
 having the located the 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.329
 button 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.489
 the torpedo we only present ap 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.969
 that would be the coast above it 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.709
 0 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.529
 we can ps3 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.999
 one of them in two 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.389
 zenÃ³n pereyra 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.069
 And if the people can not do the same thing again 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.210
 this agreement 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.860
 we present control of 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.809
 for selecting 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:39.639
 and proposed to create a capapa mask cappa mask you can wear 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.830

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.309
 generated d 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.309
 Cairo 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.409
 and now only 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.270
 little less 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.599
 like xd 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.460
 since here but little 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.460
 it would be little 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.319
 or we can do 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.319
 move the layer for you what little more 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.870
 was then we can do this is not this part that was something 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.780
 anarchist groups eat do this 2 note why you think 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.249
 it's already good this is part of all this wallet 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.950
 the images I will leave at the door Price 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.969
 it's just a matter of not existing 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.479
 the leader is very easy 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.589
 they were worth it according to information 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.869
 and once you have logged in, another moment will come to haiti. 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.869
 pretends everything we need for our clients 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.020
