00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
the storyline is obviously I don't know

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.960 
the storyline is obviously I don't know
anything<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:42.130> hopefully<00:03:42.549> it's<00:03:42.730> kind<00:03:42.940> of

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
anything but hopefully it's kind of

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.850 
anything but hopefully it's kind of
similar<00:03:43.230> when<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.260> comes<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.530> getting<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:44.829> a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
similar when it comes to getting on a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.140 
similar when it comes to getting on a
team<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.370> can<00:03:45.519> kind<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.760> be<00:03:45.910> where<00:03:46.060> you

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
team that you can kind of be where you

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.840 
team that you can kind of be where you
want<00:03:46.360> but<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.140> feel<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.290> that's<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.040> best<00:03:48.549> way

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
want but I feel like that's the best way

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.030 
want but I feel like that's the best way
to<00:03:48.910> go<00:03:49.120> about<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:50.500> know<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.590> understand<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
maybe if they do like the old way where

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.970
