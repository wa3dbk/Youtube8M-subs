00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
corners for extra protection so as you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.300 
corners for extra protection so as you
can<00:01:05.720> see<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.110> case<00:01:06.290> is<00:01:06.470> really<00:01:06.799> good<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.189> it

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
can see this case is really good and it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.070 
can see this case is really good and it
does<00:01:07.520> work<00:01:07.729> with<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.119> stock<00:01:08.570> screen

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
does work with that stock screen

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.310 
does work with that stock screen
protector<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.939> ones<00:01:11.180> cond<00:01:11.630> I've<00:01:11.930> found<00:01:12.080> in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
protector so the ones cond I've found in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.870 
protector so the ones cond I've found in
this<00:01:12.439> case<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.920> fact<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.579> case<00:01:13.729> are

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
this case is the fact that the case are

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.210 
this case is the fact that the case are
excellent<00:01:14.360> but<00:01:14.570> taking<00:01:15.229> off<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.530> case<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:15.979> on

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
excellent but taking off the case and on

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.770 
excellent but taking off the case and on
is<00:01:16.369> really<00:01:16.610> simple<00:01:16.820> all<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.119> do<00:01:17.299> is<00:01:17.450> take<00:01:17.630> out

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
is really simple all you do is take out

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.120 
is really simple all you do is take out
that<00:01:17.990> silicone<00:01:18.829> material<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.460> middle<00:01:19.730> and

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
that silicone material in the middle and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.740 
that silicone material in the middle and
all<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.280> do<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.430> put<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.700> Nexus<00:01:23.180> in<00:01:23.330> which<00:01:23.630> is

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
all you do is put the Nexus in which is

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.720 
all you do is put the Nexus in which is
really<00:01:24.080> easy<00:01:24.200> because<00:01:24.650> how<00:01:24.980> flexible<00:01:25.460> this

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
really easy because how flexible this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.030 
really easy because how flexible this
material<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.200> let's<00:01:27.500> just<00:01:27.710> go<00:01:27.800> ahead<00:01:27.830> and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
material is so let's just go ahead and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.070 
material is so let's just go ahead and
put<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.640> make<00:01:29.240> sure<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:29.659> all<00:01:29.750> around

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
put that in make sure it's all around

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.990 
put that in make sure it's all around
good<00:01:30.590> complete<00:01:30.860> let<00:01:31.430> me<00:01:31.520> take<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.760> hard

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
good complete let me take the hard

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.570 
good complete let me take the hard
material<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.110> outside<00:01:33.470> what<00:01:33.950> we<00:01:34.070> do<00:01:34.250> is

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
material on the outside what we do is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580 
material on the outside what we do is
you<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:35.270> put<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:35.600> volume<00:01:35.930> rocker<00:01:36.140> or<00:01:36.290> the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
you can put it in volume rocker or the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.050 
you can put it in volume rocker or the
power<00:01:36.740> button<00:01:36.920> side<00:01:37.190> first<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.580> do<00:01:37.640> volume

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
power button side first I do volume

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.570 
power button side first I do volume
rocker<00:01:38.300> since<00:01:38.659> they<00:01:38.840> are<00:01:38.900> more<00:01:39.080> wide<00:01:39.580> doesn't

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
rocker since they are more wide doesn't

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.190 
rocker since they are more wide doesn't
really<00:01:40.670> matter<00:01:40.790> all<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.720> put<00:01:42.020> that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
really matter all you do is put that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.430 
really matter all you do is put that
side<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.530> first<00:01:43.390> pull<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.540> slip<00:01:44.780> over<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
side and first pull the slip over the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.410 
side and first pull the slip over the
side<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.860> case<00:01:46.010> and<00:01:46.250> then<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.030> make<00:01:47.180> sure

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
side of the case and then you make sure

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.480 
side of the case and then you make sure
the<00:01:47.540> buttons<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.170> place<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.979> can<00:01:49.040> sometimes

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
the buttons in place you can sometimes

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.580 
the buttons in place you can sometimes
do<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.760> like<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.450> then<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.170> case<00:01:51.320> should

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
do it like that and then the case should

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.910 
do it like that and then the case should
be<00:01:51.620> nice<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.190> snug<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.140> case<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.380> really

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
be nice and snug so the case is really

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.640 
be nice and snug so the case is really
