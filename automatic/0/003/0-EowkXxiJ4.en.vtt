00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.960 
you're pushing the flow down and the
flow<00:01:43.049> guys<00:01:43.259> gravity<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.040> guess<00:01:44.520> everything

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
flow guys gravity I guess everything

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.359 
flow guys gravity I guess everything
that<00:01:45.149> has<00:01:45.299> weight<00:01:45.600> guy's<00:01:46.409> gravity<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.280> me

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that has weight guy's gravity but for me

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.130 
that has weight guy's gravity but for me
that's<00:01:47.610> too<00:01:47.850> easy<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.360> started<00:01:48.869> adding

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that's too easy so I started adding

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.190 
that's too easy so I started adding
weights<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> flow<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:51.930> pushing

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
weights on to the flow so I'm pushing

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.580 
weights on to the flow so I'm pushing
like<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.649> extra<00:01:53.070> 10<00:01:53.369> 20<00:01:53.820> kilograms<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
like an extra 10 20 kilograms down you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.620 
like an extra 10 20 kilograms down you
gotta<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.729> creative<00:01:57.360> unless
