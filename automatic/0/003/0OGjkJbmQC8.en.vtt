00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.170
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.470
 I also do world rubber market 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.720
 This time 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.769
 a I think that I would like to follow about the three steps to learn to drive hot 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.760
 I will 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:24.919
 It is quite easy just to rub the person who is using transcription 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:29.640
 It strikes so that it can bite into the rubber because it can not balance the power 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:35.220
 It becomes a very important item because 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 It was compatible with speed and rotation by mastering the drive to heat up 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:45.839
 It means that you can hit the drive 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.530
 Only of multiplying the rotation only to these kites for anyone to play, especially in the middle甚野 Hiroshi people 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.690
 about 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.010
 Even if the power falls and is pushed back 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.870
 I want to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.789
 You have become important is that even But drive 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.789
 I will explain the procedure in 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.790
 Here is the first step 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.130
 In flat against the way back table also in the way of behind 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.460
 I will divert 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 Rather than send the structure of the opponent rubbed with this sometimes surface as sent to the flat 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.060
 It is the basis of the drive we are dealing with 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.420
 Next I would like to go to the second procedure 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:59.920
 Next will come hit to the front of the face to skip firmly at an angle to shed to a little while ago of flat 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.150
 The feeling that the ball is cut into the rubber in this Well shake to skip firmly when 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.170
 Please feel well 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.220
 There is a sense that the goal bites into a place where this rubber is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.170
 Hot swing 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.170
 It becomes the basis of putting rotation 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.250
 Ah 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 The third step is the next step if you get a sense of getting it to bite firmly in the current second step 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.930
 I want to go to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.010
 Especially the third one in the procedure drive put firmly the waist that a full swing 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.690
 It will be 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.180
 It is point at this time 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.410
 If you hit firmly like this, it will be a smash even if you swing your waist firmly 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.740
 Put a little more noodles than a little while ago 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.840
 I will try to cover a little 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.200
 At that time, I think that many people say that they will rub if they cover it . 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.750
 Well treated up to the second of the procedure 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.380
 I think that I use the sense of biting in, so let me write that feeling a little 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.800
 Please give me 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:25.850
 At that time, if the ball is firmly in the shape of a mountain and sinks, it takes a turn 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.850
 Please pay attention to it because it means that 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.639
 About three steps that you are using right now 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:38.610
 It will be the basis of the drive you are dealing with 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:42.720
 This sense is the first thing to say that it receives more rotation from here and makes the speed faster 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:50.190
 It is important to support 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:52.540
 For example Well firm who want to put behind than a little earlier from behind while the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.169
 While putting on the top 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.849
 Please try to come grab from Tteyuu firm with feeling rather than to 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.009
 here 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.040
 If you are not good at feeling to bite , you may want to use a slightly softer rubber 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.250
 May 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.310
 As we can hold well if we use soft mule 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.870
 I think it is easy to grasp the sense of biting 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.870
 Please try a challenge
