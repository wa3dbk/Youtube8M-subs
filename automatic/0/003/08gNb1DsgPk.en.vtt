ten and a half's on the other so those
are<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.040> highest<00:01:11.670> strings<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> G<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

open up the pack here they're wound up

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.090 
open up the pack here they're wound up
just<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.600> undo<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:30.500> take<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> loop<00:01:31.860> end

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just kind of undo that take the loop end

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.120 
just kind of undo that take the loop end
right<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.970> we're<00:01:33.869> gonna<00:01:33.930> put<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:37.130> around

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
right here we're gonna put it in around

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.440 
right here we're gonna put it in around
that<00:01:38.280> loop<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.240> can't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that loop right there I know you can't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.780 
that loop right there I know you can't
see<00:01:39.690> this<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:40.080> now<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.430> long<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
see this right now but as long as you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270 
see this right now but as long as you
get<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> concept<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.690> basic<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.590> then

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
get the concept is pretty basic and then

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.010 
get the concept is pretty basic and then
I'm<00:01:44.400> gonna<00:01:44.520> wrap<00:01:45.150> that<00:01:47.119> underneath<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.810> tail

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I'm gonna wrap that underneath the tail

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.170 
I'm gonna wrap that underneath the tail
piece<00:01:49.260> there<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> took<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
piece there like it was when I took it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.260 
piece there like it was when I took it
off<00:01:51.299> pull<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.260> through<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.270> then

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
off pull it through here and then

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.590 
off pull it through here and then
there's<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.970> little<00:01:56.970> nut<00:01:57.240> right

I like to leave a little bit of slack

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140 
I like to leave a little bit of slack
just<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.860> make<00:02:11.039> sure<00:02:11.189> I<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.639> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
just so I can make sure I get like you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.809 
just so I can make sure I get like you
know<00:02:12.239> about<00:02:12.389> two<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.749> three<00:02:12.779> lines<00:02:13.669> around<00:02:14.669> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
know about two to three lines around the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.340 
know about two to three lines around the
string<00:02:15.209> there<00:02:15.419> so<00:02:15.659> if<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.109> can

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
string there so if you can

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.480 
string there so if you can
see<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.770> know<00:02:16.890> there's<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.160> little<00:02:17.310> bit

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
see that you know there's a little bit

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.580 
see that you know there's a little bit
of<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.610> bow<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> string<00:02:18.420> that's<00:02:19.230> probably

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
of a bow in the string that's probably

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410 
of a bow in the string that's probably
more<00:02:19.830> than<00:02:19.890> enough<00:02:20.160> right<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.240> then<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
more than enough right there and then I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.900 
more than enough right there and then I
like<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.630> keep<00:02:21.840> my<00:02:22.080> thumb<00:02:22.530> placed<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
like to keep my thumb placed on the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.880 
like to keep my thumb placed on the
string<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:26.390> that'll<00:02:27.390> keep<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.690> taut

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
string and that'll keep it taut

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.260 
string and that'll keep it taut
well<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.100> tighten<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.790> I'm<00:02:29.880> gonna<00:02:30.090> always

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
well I tighten it and I'm gonna always

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.080 
well I tighten it and I'm gonna always
wind<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.040> string<00:02:32.630> goes<00:02:34.010> from

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
wind it so that the string goes from

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.060 
wind it so that the string goes from
around<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.330> outs<00:02:36.810> inside<00:02:37.560> towards<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
around the outs inside towards the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.910 
around the outs inside towards the
outside<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.230> another<00:02:40.470> thing<00:02:40.740> where

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
outside and this is another thing where

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.350 
outside and this is another thing where
when<00:02:41.190> you're<00:02:41.250> taking<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:41.940> strings<00:02:42.240> you

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
when you're taking off your strings you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.470 
when you're taking off your strings you
can<00:02:42.420> look<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.840> at<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.170> tail<00:02:43.950> piece<00:02:44.130> up<00:02:44.340> or<00:02:44.730> head

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
can look up at the tail piece up or head

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.220 
can look up at the tail piece up or head
piece<00:02:45.660> up<00:02:45.840> there

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
piece up there

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
piece up there
notice<00:02:46.860> how<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.130> strings<00:02:47.490> are<00:02:47.610> round<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
notice how the strings are round so that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.850 
notice how the strings are round so that
when<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.140> again<00:02:49.380> you'll<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.740> right

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
when you do it again you'll get it right

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.210 
when you do it again you'll get it right
and<00:02:50.960> this<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.140> crucial<00:02:52.440> part<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.100> to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
and this is the crucial part I like to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.190 
and this is the crucial part I like to
go<00:02:53.990> underneath<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.850> if<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.030> look<00:02:57.210> right<00:02:57.360> here

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.120 

I'm<00:03:01.200> gonna<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:03.200> underneath<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.590> string<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
I'm gonna go underneath the string to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.350 
I'm gonna go underneath the string to
start<00:03:05.400> with<00:03:09.650> one<00:03:10.650> loop<00:03:10.830> around<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.240> can

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
start with one loop around so you can

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.740 
start with one loop around so you can
see<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.870> hold<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.650> banjos<00:03:14.070> heavy<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.750> then

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
see that hold this banjos heavy and then

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.870 
see that hold this banjos heavy and then
once<00:03:16.740> like<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:17.160> all<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.460> way<00:03:17.550> underneath

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
once like it's all the way underneath

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.720 
once like it's all the way underneath
the<00:03:18.720> string<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.710> being<00:03:20.190> wound<00:03:20.460> I'm

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the string that was is being wound I'm

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.100 
the string that was is being wound I'm
gonna<00:03:20.880> push<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.240> up<00:03:21.360> like<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.720> that'll

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
gonna push it up like that and that'll

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.810 
gonna push it up like that and that'll
make<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.260> go<00:03:22.470> over<00:03:22.860> top<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.460> rest<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
make it go over top the rest of the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820 
make it go over top the rest of the
times<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.780> from<00:03:24.930> then<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.680> not

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
times and from then on I can just not

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.320 
times and from then on I can just not
even<00:03:26.100> worry<00:03:26.250> about<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:27.060> gonna<00:03:27.180> go

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
even worry about it I know it's gonna go

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.410 
even worry about it I know it's gonna go
over<00:03:27.510> top<00:03:27.690> because<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.080> pushed<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.880> oh

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
over top because I pushed it up and oh

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.090 
over top because I pushed it up and oh
that's<00:03:30.990> heavy<00:03:31.170> I'm<00:03:31.320> gonna<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.650> rearrange

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
that's heavy I'm gonna have to rearrange

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.730 
that's heavy I'm gonna have to rearrange
here<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.810> think<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:33.960> like<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> 20<00:03:34.500> pound

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
here I think this is like a 20 pound

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.720 
here I think this is like a 20 pound
banjo<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:38.010> I'm<00:03:38.070> just<00:03:38.190> gonna<00:03:38.280> keep<00:03:38.490> winding

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
banjo so I'm just gonna keep winding

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.100 
banjo so I'm just gonna keep winding
that<00:03:39.030> up<00:03:39.210> and<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:40.440> I'm<00:03:40.620> winding<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:42.020> until<00:03:43.020> it

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
that up and as I'm winding it until it

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.150 
that up and as I'm winding it until it
gets<00:03:43.260> hot<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> won't<00:03:43.920> really<00:03:44.100> worry

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
gets hot I won't really worry

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.100 
gets hot I won't really worry
once<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.030> starts<00:03:47.270> to<00:03:47.330> tighten<00:03:47.540> up<00:03:47.720> that's<00:03:47.990> what

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
once it starts to tighten up that's what

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.710 
once it starts to tighten up that's what
I<00:03:48.170> actually<00:03:48.350> plug<00:03:48.740> it<00:03:49.300> just<00:03:50.300> get<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.450> about

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
I actually plug it just get it about

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.200 
I actually plug it just get it about
there<00:03:50.990> and<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.530> leave<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:52.130> little<00:03:52.910> bit<00:03:53.120> at

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
there and then I leave a little bit at

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.570 
there and then I leave a little bit at
the<00:03:53.330> end<00:03:53.500> until<00:03:54.500> I'm<00:03:54.590> fully<00:03:54.920> done<00:03:55.190> changing

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
the end until I'm fully done changing

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.960 
the end until I'm fully done changing
all<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.850> strings<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:58.670> way<00:03:58.790> I'll<00:03:58.910> have

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
all the strings and that way I'll have

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.220 
all the strings and that way I'll have
to<00:03:59.090> worry<00:03:59.210> about<00:03:59.300> tuning<00:03:59.720> because<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.960> lot<00:04:00.140> of

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
to worry about tuning because a lot of

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.310 
to worry about tuning because a lot of
times<00:04:00.410> what<00:04:01.190> you'll<00:04:01.310> do<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.990> you'll<00:04:02.990> tune<00:04:03.200> it

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
times what you'll do is you'll tune it

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.840 
times what you'll do is you'll tune it
too<00:04:03.440> much<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.800> break<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.040> string<00:04:04.310> I'm<00:04:04.640> gonna

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
too much and break a string I'm gonna

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.750 
too much and break a string I'm gonna
show<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.120> now<00:04:05.210> how<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.600> change<00:04:06.610> one<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.640> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
show you now how to change one of the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.700 
show you now how to change one of the

these again put it through that loop in

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.070 
these again put it through that loop in
the<00:04:21.500> back<00:04:21.709> here<00:04:22.160> just<00:04:22.820> like<00:04:22.940> I<00:04:23.030> did<00:04:23.180> before<00:04:23.210> now

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.020 
the back here just like I did before now
like<00:04:24.230> I<00:04:24.320> said<00:04:24.380> just<00:04:24.530> make<00:04:24.860> sure<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.280> know<00:04:25.820> how

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.310 
like I said just make sure you know how
that<00:04:26.150> your<00:04:26.240> tail<00:04:26.420> piece<00:04:26.630> works<00:04:26.900> they're<00:04:27.140> all<00:04:27.230> a

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
that your tail piece works they're all a

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.170 
that your tail piece works they're all a
little<00:04:27.470> bit<00:04:27.590> dimmer<00:04:27.890> input<00:04:28.220> slide<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.060> the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
little bit dimmer input slide it in the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.530 
little bit dimmer input slide it in the
groove<00:04:29.290> over<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.380> bridge<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.100> then<00:04:31.820> down<00:04:32.120> to

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
groove over the bridge and then down to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.930 
groove over the bridge and then down to
the<00:04:32.720> end<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.200> then<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.310> doesn't<00:04:34.460> have<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.700> sit

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
the end and then it doesn't have to sit

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.560 
the end and then it doesn't have to sit
in<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:36.470> groove<00:04:36.740> not<00:04:37.520> there<00:04:37.760> just<00:04:37.790> right<00:04:38.360> yeah

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
in the groove not there just right yeah

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.870 
in the groove not there just right yeah
as<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:39.460> I'm<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:40.580> gonna<00:04:40.820> slide<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.270> through<00:04:42.880> and

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
as I I'm just gonna slide it through and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.640 
as I I'm just gonna slide it through and
once<00:04:44.150> again<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.420> don't<00:04:44.540> want<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.930> pull<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.320> all

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
once again I don't want to pull it all

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.290 
once again I don't want to pull it all
the<00:04:45.680> way<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.520> can<00:04:46.730> actually<00:04:46.880> get<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.150> few

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the way so I can actually get a few

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.970 
the way so I can actually get a few
turns<00:04:47.540> in<00:04:47.690> there<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.020> keep<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.320> kind<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.530> taut

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
turns in there so I keep it kind of taut

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.920 
turns in there so I keep it kind of taut
I<00:04:49.010> put<00:04:49.550> my<00:04:49.760> thumb<00:04:49.970> down<00:04:50.180> there<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.480> start<00:04:50.720> with

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
I put my thumb down there to start with

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.980 
I put my thumb down there to start with
so<00:04:51.890> that<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.430> can<00:04:52.580> wrap<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.420> this<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:53.870> where

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
so that I can wrap it and this is where

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.210 
so that I can wrap it and this is where
it<00:04:54.050> gets<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.260> little<00:04:54.290> tricky<00:04:54.800> I'm<00:04:54.920> gonna<00:04:55.070> try

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
it gets a little tricky I'm gonna try

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.680 
it gets a little tricky I'm gonna try
and<00:04:55.370> show<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:55.700> as<00:04:55.880> best<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.180> can<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:56.630> I'm

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
and show you this as best I can so I'm

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.260 
and show you this as best I can so I'm
gonna<00:04:56.810> keep<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.140> going<00:04:57.830> under<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:58.940> I'm<00:04:59.120> gonna

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
gonna keep it going under but I'm gonna

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.640 
gonna keep it going under but I'm gonna
have<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.480> let<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.660> kind<00:05:00.230> of<00:05:00.260> force<00:05:00.530> it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
have to let it kind of force it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.260 
have to let it kind of force it
underneath<00:05:00.950> there<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.400> what<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:02.000> string<00:05:02.240> is

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
underneath there and what the string is

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.120 
underneath there and what the string is
gonna<00:05:02.510> want<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:03.230> gonna<00:05:03.620> flip<00:05:03.920> back

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
gonna want to do is it's gonna flip back

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.010 
gonna want to do is it's gonna flip back
over<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.610> I'm<00:05:04.670> just<00:05:04.730> gonna<00:05:04.910> try<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:05.750> make<00:05:05.990> sure

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
over so I'm just gonna try and make sure

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.140 
over so I'm just gonna try and make sure
that<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.560> doesn't<00:05:06.860> get<00:05:07.430> too<00:05:07.640> stubborn<00:05:08.060> in

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
that it doesn't get too stubborn in

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.340 
that it doesn't get too stubborn in
there<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.510> try<00:05:08.660> to<00:05:08.690> flip<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.140> one's

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
there and try to flip this one's

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.290 
there and try to flip this one's
actually<00:05:09.620> being<00:05:09.800> pretty<00:05:10.040> good<00:05:10.220> so<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.000> got<00:05:11.180> it

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
actually being pretty good so I got it

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.840 
actually being pretty good so I got it
around<00:05:11.510> once<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.990> went<00:05:12.170> underneath<00:05:12.850> that

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
around once it went underneath that

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.240 
around once it went underneath that
string<00:05:14.240> one<00:05:14.810> time<00:05:15.050> so<00:05:15.500> I'm<00:05:15.620> gonna<00:05:15.740> clip<00:05:16.040> it<00:05:16.070> up

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
string one time so I'm gonna clip it up

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.980 
string one time so I'm gonna clip it up
like<00:05:16.490> that<00:05:16.520> push<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.120> up<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:17.390> that<00:05:17.630> will<00:05:17.870> go

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
like that push it up so that will go

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.370 
like that push it up so that will go
over<00:05:18.380> top<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.940> keeping<00:05:20.690> my<00:05:20.780> thumb<00:05:21.050> here<00:05:21.260> is

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
over top and keeping my thumb here is

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.310 
over top and keeping my thumb here is
great<00:05:21.650> cuz<00:05:21.920> it<00:05:22.270> just<00:05:23.270> keeps<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:23.780> tension

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
great cuz it just keeps that tension

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.590 
great cuz it just keeps that tension
even<00:05:24.470> though<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:25.760> rest<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.180> string<00:05:26.420> is

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
even though the rest of the string is

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.660 
even though the rest of the string is
really<00:05:26.750> loose<00:05:27.140> no<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:27.890> kind<00:05:28.160> of<00:05:28.220> wind<00:05:28.430> it

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
really loose no I just kind of wind it

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.540 
really loose no I just kind of wind it
I'm<00:05:29.630> gonna<00:05:29.840> try<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.170> line<00:05:30.410> it<00:05:30.680> as<00:05:30.770> fast<00:05:31.190> as<00:05:31.400> I

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
bit too much slack to begin with but

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
I'm going to use my tuner here and just

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.050 
I'm going to use my tuner here and just
stick<00:06:08.069> it<00:06:08.159> on<00:06:08.249> the<00:06:08.340> end<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.550> banjo<00:06:08.849> always

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
stick it on the end of the banjo always

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.029 
stick it on the end of the banjo always
good<00:06:09.240> to<00:06:09.330> use<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.449> tuner<00:06:09.840> when<00:06:10.740> you're<00:06:10.860> tuning

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
good to use a tuner when you're tuning

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:20.330 
good to use a tuner when you're tuning
instead<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.639> using<00:06:11.789> your<00:06:11.999> ear<00:06:19.069> maybe<00:06:20.069> even<00:06:20.310> a

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
instead of using your ear maybe even a

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.059 
instead of using your ear maybe even a
little<00:06:20.639> bit<00:06:20.759> past<00:06:20.969> the<00:06:21.180> tail<00:06:21.590> and<00:06:22.590> then<00:06:22.800> this

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
little bit past the tail and then this

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:24.559 
little bit past the tail and then this
is<00:06:23.219> the<00:06:23.340> part<00:06:23.490> that<00:06:23.639> I<00:06:23.789> think<00:06:23.999> a<00:06:24.060> lot<00:06:24.090> of<00:06:24.300> people

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
is the part that I think a lot of people

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.999 
is the part that I think a lot of people
don't<00:06:24.749> even<00:06:24.900> realize<00:06:25.050> they<00:06:25.469> can<00:06:25.620> do<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:25.919> you

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
don't even realize they can do is you

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.260 
don't even realize they can do is you
can<00:06:26.099> actually<00:06:26.400> kind<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.639> yank<00:06:26.909> on<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.240> string

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
can actually kind of yank on the string

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.239 
can actually kind of yank on the string
and<00:06:29.960> this<00:06:30.960> will<00:06:31.110> pull<00:06:31.319> any<00:06:31.560> tension<00:06:32.099> out<00:06:32.189> of

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:32.249 
and this will pull any tension out of

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:33.860 
and this will pull any tension out of
the<00:06:32.339> string<00:06:32.639> that<00:06:32.819> might<00:06:32.969> have<00:06:33.089> been<00:06:33.210> there<00:06:33.509> so

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
the string that might have been there so

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.230 
the string that might have been there so
let's<00:06:34.020> just<00:06:34.110> see<00:06:34.580> that<00:06:35.580> dropped<00:06:35.939> it<00:06:36.060> down

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
let's just see that dropped it down

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.339 
let's just see that dropped it down
almost<00:06:36.740> kind<00:06:37.740> of<00:06:37.800> a<00:06:37.860> step<00:06:38.189> there<00:06:39.199> it's<00:06:40.199> great

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
almost kind of a step there it's great

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.189 
almost kind of a step there it's great
thing<00:06:40.560> to<00:06:40.650> do<00:06:40.830> for<00:06:41.099> each<00:06:41.249> of<00:06:41.279> these<00:06:43.639> cracking

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
thing to do for each of these cracking

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.140 
thing to do for each of these cracking
do<00:06:46.199> that<00:06:46.379> to<00:06:46.560> about<00:06:46.800> E<00:06:47.039> and<00:06:47.849> then<00:06:47.999> I'm<00:06:48.120> just

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
do that to about E and then I'm just

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.329 
do that to about E and then I'm just
gonna<00:06:48.360> pull<00:06:48.719> on<00:06:48.870> it<00:06:49.020> like<00:06:49.199> I<00:06:49.349> said<00:06:49.409> all<00:06:50.039> the<00:06:50.249> way

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:50.339 
gonna pull on it like I said all the way

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.749 
gonna pull on it like I said all the way
up<00:06:50.490> and<00:06:50.669> down<00:06:50.779> the<00:06:51.779> back<00:06:52.069> don't<00:06:53.069> worry<00:06:53.550> about

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
up and down the back don't worry about

00:06:53.759 --> 00:07:13.850 
up and down the back don't worry about
pulling<00:06:54.060> too<00:06:54.479> lightly<00:07:11.599> to<00:07:12.599> Bannerjee<00:07:13.169> this<00:07:13.740> is

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
pulling too lightly to Bannerjee this is

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.200 
pulling too lightly to Bannerjee this is
just<00:07:14.009> a<00:07:14.099> rough<00:07:14.310> tune<00:07:14.610> doesn't<00:07:14.939> have<00:07:15.029> to<00:07:15.120> be

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
just a rough tune doesn't have to be

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.450 
just a rough tune doesn't have to be
perfect<00:07:15.689> I'm<00:07:16.409> just<00:07:16.589> pulling<00:07:16.979> through<00:07:17.279> like

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
perfect I'm just pulling through like

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.960 
perfect I'm just pulling through like
that

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.909 

so<00:07:24.970> the<00:07:25.060> banjo<00:07:25.389> will<00:07:25.540> tend<00:07:25.720> to<00:07:25.810> slide<00:07:26.020> attitude

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 
so the banjo will tend to slide attitude

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.710 
so the banjo will tend to slide attitude
with<00:07:27.550> new<00:07:27.729> strings<00:07:28.060> so<00:07:28.210> you<00:07:28.270> want<00:07:28.419> to<00:07:28.479> play<00:07:28.660> it

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
with new strings so you want to play it

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.590 
with new strings so you want to play it
as<00:07:28.870> much<00:07:29.020> as<00:07:29.169> you<00:07:29.320> can
