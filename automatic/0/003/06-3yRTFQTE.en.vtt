more sensitive to change than the others

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.880 
more sensitive to change than the others
so<00:00:38.590> doesn't<00:00:39.590> really<00:00:39.710> even<00:00:39.890> watch<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:41.830> it's<00:00:42.830> a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890

there's<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.620> first<00:01:19.920> feeding<00:01:20.250> since<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.090> know

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
there's the first feeding since you know

there's the first feeding since you know
the<00:01:21.360> new<00:01:21.480> filtration<00:01:21.810> system<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> check

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the new filtration system you can check

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.710 
the new filtration system you can check
out<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.130> garfish<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:24.150> find<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.510> a<00:01:24.570> lot

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
out the garfish actually find it a lot

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.330 
out the garfish actually find it a lot
easier<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> eat<00:01:25.290> didn't<00:01:25.680> take<00:01:25.830> fish<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.190> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
easier to eat didn't take fish off the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.620 
easier to eat didn't take fish off the
ground<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.730> with<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> wrong

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
ground so with the wrong

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.970 
ground so with the wrong
it<00:01:27.690> makes<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.050> fish<00:01:28.230> land<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.620> uneven

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
it makes the fish land that uneven

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.950 
it makes the fish land that uneven
angles<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:29.640> actually<00:01:30.030> increases<00:01:30.840> their

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
angles which actually increases their

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.360 
angles which actually increases their
chance<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.410> getting<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.800> fish<00:01:31.980> before<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
chance of getting the fish before the

chance of getting the fish before the
other<00:01:32.520> fish<00:01:32.730> steal<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.690> you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.720 

this<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.470> little<00:01:59.770> tank<00:02:00.010> feeling<00:02:00.370> update

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
this is a little tank feeling update

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.520 
this is a little tank feeling update
since<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.090> new<00:02:01.210> filtration<00:02:01.810> system<00:02:02.230> it's<00:02:02.500> a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
since the new filtration system it's a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.630 
since the new filtration system it's a
little<00:02:02.560> bit<00:02:02.830> blurry<00:02:03.160> because<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.490> actually

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
little bit blurry because I actually

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640 
little bit blurry because I actually
zoomed<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.270> all<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.780> way<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:04.960> was<00:02:05.230> far<00:02:05.470> away

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
zoomed in all the way I was far away

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.960 
zoomed in all the way I was far away
because<00:02:05.950> these<00:02:06.070> fish<00:02:06.310> are<00:02:06.460> really<00:02:06.610> skittish

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
because these fish are really skittish

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.270 
because these fish are really skittish
so<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.660> had<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.870> film<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.289> from<00:02:08.500> like<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.860> window

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
so I had to film it from like the window

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.190 
so I had to film it from like the window
behind<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:10.000> tank<00:02:10.240> as<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.780> can<00:02:10.929> see<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
behind the tank as you can see the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.290 
behind the tank as you can see the
waters<00:02:11.500> crystal<00:02:11.920> clear<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.400> man<00:02:12.910> these<00:02:13.120> guys

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
waters crystal clear and man these guys

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.610 
waters crystal clear and man these guys
are<00:02:13.450> really<00:02:13.570> chowing<00:02:14.080> down<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.380> I've<00:02:14.500> never

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
are really chowing down like I've never

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.740
