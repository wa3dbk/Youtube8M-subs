00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.410
 this jack you have to charge a camera 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.540
 that soon despite the scope 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.800
 7 kilos 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.660
 like 6 kilos is cannon with reason is so 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.900
 so 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.180
 yes no jajajajaja good we do not start 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.250
 to make this mix well let's put 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.990
 first the pineapple for the girl who has 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.000
 very high bromelain and bromelain what 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
 is to accelerate and accelerate the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.910
 liquid metabolism what does it mean 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.920
 goodbye to cellulite because it takes away 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.330
 move the fat release energy let's go 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 we give our out for the fat 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.870
 let's also put strawberries for the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.340
 strawberry girl 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.880
 that is not 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.750
 papi diosito you're in heaven 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's yours we're not going to put milk now 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.200
 of soy 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.689
 that again because it has phytoestrogens 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.490
 it's a nice protein source to me 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.380
 like because it's a protein apart 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.049
 vegetarian what does it mean that no 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.729
 contains saturated fats and then the 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.710
 fats that we're going to be eliminating go 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.060
 to be forever 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.770
 now let's put some essence 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.630
 of vanilla that as you well know 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.820
 that province here ask dani bea 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 well and wells if we're not going to put a little 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:10.030
 of natural orange juice 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.170
 preferably a little honey 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.060
 to sweeten 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.470
 he said they are touching me to put him there 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.010
 coconut liqueur no 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.240
 but do not listen to me on Monday we are going to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.020
 put cinnamon 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.200
 cinnamon is an aphrodisiac also this 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.700
 It has much selenium and selenium as 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.700
 it also helps you to be sane 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.040
 it helps you to be this agreement is not 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.280
 you attuned yourself with 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.260
 the master cosmos we are going to put water on it 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.109
 now grace coconut water is a 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.849
 good is the most coconut water with 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.090
 people who do sport that is 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.629
 hearing when they want to hydrate by 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.919
 please do not take these measures 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.870
 that moisturise because actually what 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.120
 do is dehydrate the long destrata 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.370
 they hydrate for a while after the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.489
 glucose to the floor and you're already dehydrated 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.680
 Coconut water is excellent for 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.139
 hydrate has a lot of potassium they have 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.620
 agnes i give you have two minerals 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.659
 essential basics to regulate the level 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.290
 hydric of the body and remove that 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.260
 retention of fluid control and so 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.310
 let's do our 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.310
 our little water 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.700
 and turned up high ever 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.180
 and hall is like this you know the arch as I 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180
 can fascinate 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.220
 there is in the coconut there in the field 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.580
 and we're going to put it in a little glass 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:00.080
 these are not what smells of the beach 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.790

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.790
