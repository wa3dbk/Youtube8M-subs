to react differently you want to make

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
to react differently you want to make
your<00:01:03.390> continuation<00:01:03.899> bets<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> same<00:01:04.949> size

your continuation bets the same size

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.210 
your continuation bets the same size
every<00:01:06.210> time<00:01:06.510> even<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:07.920> bluffing

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
every time even when you are bluffing

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640 
every time even when you are bluffing
this<00:01:08.970> makes<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> hard<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.080> opponents<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this makes it hard for your opponents to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
this makes it hard for your opponents to
discern<00:01:11.070> whether<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> hand<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
discern whether you have a hand or you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.200 
discern whether you have a hand or you
don't<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.740> always<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> give<00:01:14.760> away<00:01:14.970> as

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
don't you always want to give away as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.469 
don't you always want to give away as
little<00:01:15.869> information<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.770> possible<00:01:17.479> however

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
little information as possible however

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289

for experienced players varying your bet
sizing<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.229> extremely<00:01:22.979> profitable<00:01:23.520> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
sizing can be extremely profitable but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.770 
sizing can be extremely profitable but
I'll<00:01:24.540> save<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.110> another<00:01:25.409> time<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.780> good

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
I'll save that for another time a good

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.289 
I'll save that for another time a good
rule<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.650> pick<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.070> certain<00:01:29.579> percentage<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

continuation bet for fifty percent I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
continuation bet for fifty percent I
recommend<00:01:39.600> anything<00:01:39.900> between<00:01:40.229> fifty<00:01:40.920> percent

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
recommend anything between fifty percent
