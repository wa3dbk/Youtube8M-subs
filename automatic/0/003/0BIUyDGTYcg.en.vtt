but one thing I do know that I don't

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.640 
but one thing I do know that I don't
want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.480> because<00:02:00.480> I<00:02:00.690> don't<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.260> click

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
want to do because I don't want to click

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.690 
want to do because I don't want to click
on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> wrong<00:02:02.010> way<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.220> because<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.460> feel<00:02:02.670> like

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
on the wrong way it because I feel like

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.070 
on the wrong way it because I feel like
that'd<00:02:02.970> be<00:02:03.150> hot<00:02:03.330> it's<00:02:03.510> going<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.690> be<00:02:03.780> hard<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
that'd be hot it's going to be hard to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.419 
that'd be hot it's going to be hard to
camouflage<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.850> parts<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> i'm

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
camouflage the parts that way so i'm

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.850 
camouflage the parts that way so i'm
going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.879> use

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
going to use

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.850

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
my shea cream i'm going to use about

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.930 
my shea cream i'm going to use about
this<00:02:14.220> much<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.569> section

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
much then i'm going to braid i'm going

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.940 
much then i'm going to braid i'm going
to<00:02:44.849> braid<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.569> side<00:02:45.989> because<00:02:46.319> i<00:02:46.530> don't

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
to braid it to the side because i don't

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.289 
to braid it to the side because i don't
think<00:02:47.220> i<00:02:47.310> want<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.730> come<00:02:47.910> toward<00:02:48.209> my<00:02:48.420> face<00:02:50.299> so

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
think i want to come toward my face so

think i want to come toward my face so
i'm<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.720> smooth<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.079> out<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
i'm going to smooth it out a bit and

i'm going to smooth it out a bit and
then<00:02:54.209> start<00:02:55.079> braiding<00:02:55.620> i<00:02:56.069> hope<00:02:56.900> they<00:02:57.900> all<00:02:57.930> at

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
then start braiding i hope they all at

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.559 
then start braiding i hope they all at
least<00:02:58.620> know<00:02:58.860> how<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> braid<00:03:00.049> at<00:03:01.049> least<00:03:02.569> cuz

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
least know how to braid at least cuz

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.059 
least know how to braid at least cuz
like<00:03:03.720> i<00:03:03.959> don't<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.290> i<00:03:04.349> can<00:03:04.500> break<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.920> down

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
like i don't think i can break it down

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.690 
like i don't think i can break it down
like<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.640> but<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:07.500> stop<00:03:07.739> braiding<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.579> I'm

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
like that but we stop braiding and I'm

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.350 
like that but we stop braiding and I'm
kind<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.480> putting<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.140> good<00:03:10.530> amount<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.890> tension

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
kind of putting a good amount of tension

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.949 
kind of putting a good amount of tension
not<00:03:12.360> one<00:03:12.690> my<00:03:13.170> route<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:13.799> on<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> actual<00:03:14.959> braid

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
not one my route but on the actual braid

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.340 
not one my route but on the actual braid
and<00:03:16.380> then<00:03:17.239> what<00:03:18.239> I'm<00:03:18.329> going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.540> do<00:03:18.780> I'm<00:03:19.290> going

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and then what I'm going to do I'm going

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.599 
and then what I'm going to do I'm going
to<00:03:19.590> get<00:03:19.739> about<00:03:20.420> here<00:03:21.420> I'm<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.459> ensure

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
to get about here I'm just to ensure

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.160 
to get about here I'm just to ensure
that<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.180> get<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.810> curly<00:03:25.680> type<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.750> I'm<00:03:27.750> going<00:03:28.109> to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
that I get a curly type and I'm going to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.080 
that I get a curly type and I'm going to
take<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.319> little<00:03:28.530> bit<00:03:28.769> more<00:03:29.190> out<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.400> vera<00:03:29.730> gel

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
take a little bit more out of vera gel

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.930 
take a little bit more out of vera gel
and<00:03:30.389> then<00:03:31.200> step<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.709> put<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.130> three<00:03:32.459> sections

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and then step and put the three sections

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.430 
and then step and put the three sections
into<00:03:33.299> two<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:34.200> start<00:03:34.500> twisting<00:03:36.440> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
into two and then start twisting and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.110 
into two and then start twisting and
then<00:03:37.650> start<00:03:37.950> twisting<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.700> same<00:03:38.910> way

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
then start twisting this is the same way

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.979 
then start twisting this is the same way
I<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.299> my<00:03:39.420> braid<00:03:39.810> outs<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.350> my<00:03:41.120> on<00:03:42.120> my<00:03:42.180> wet<00:03:42.959> hair
