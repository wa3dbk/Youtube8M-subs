can probably tell from the gameplay
going<00:06:53.290> on<00:06:53.380> here<00:06:53.650> but<00:06:53.680> that<00:06:54.460> alone<00:06:54.970> is<00:06:55.240> cool

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 
going on here but that alone is cool

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.660 
going on here but that alone is cool
going<00:06:55.900> up<00:06:55.990> against<00:06:56.260> armies<00:06:56.710> of<00:06:57.010> enemies<00:06:57.430> while
