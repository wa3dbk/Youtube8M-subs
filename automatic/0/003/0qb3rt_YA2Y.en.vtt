00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
why would I use publish servers for the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.210 
why would I use publish servers for the
hard<00:00:20.840> drive<00:00:21.020> versus<00:00:21.349> just<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.619> export

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
hard drive versus just the export

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.710 
hard drive versus just the export
feature<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.150> like<00:00:23.300> we<00:00:23.419> said<00:00:23.539> in<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.689> last

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
feature and like we said in the last

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.479 
feature and like we said in the last
video<00:00:23.989> the<00:00:24.199> difference<00:00:24.739> mainly<00:00:24.919> is<00:00:25.189> when<00:00:25.399> you

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:25.489 
video the difference mainly is when you

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.850 
video the difference mainly is when you
use<00:00:25.579> the<00:00:25.700> standard<00:00:25.879> export<00:00:26.390> dialog<00:00:26.750> box<00:00:26.989> or

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
use the standard export dialog box or

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.170 
use the standard export dialog box or
when<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.040> use<00:00:28.160> a<00:00:28.219> standard<00:00:28.520> export<00:00:28.790> function

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
when you use a standard export function

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.209 
when you use a standard export function
you<00:00:29.750> don't<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.200> doesn't<00:00:30.320> lie<00:00:30.619> catalog<00:00:31.129> does

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
you don't it doesn't lie catalog does

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.589 
you don't it doesn't lie catalog does
not<00:00:31.399> keep<00:00:31.610> track<00:00:31.910> of<00:00:32.059> what<00:00:32.149> you're<00:00:32.239> exporting

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
not keep track of what you're exporting

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.240 
not keep track of what you're exporting
whereas<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.079> public<00:00:33.350> services<00:00:33.710> will<00:00:34.010> keep

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
whereas the public services will keep

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.500 
whereas the public services will keep
track<00:00:34.399> of<00:00:34.460> what's<00:00:34.700> been<00:00:34.820> exported<00:00:35.300> versus

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
track of what's been exported versus

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.090 
track of what's been exported versus
what<00:00:35.690> hasn't<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:36.710> that's<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.950> main

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
what hasn't so that's the main

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.709 
what hasn't so that's the main
difference<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:37.969> be<00:00:38.360> honest<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:38.690> don't

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
difference but to be honest we don't

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.840 
difference but to be honest we don't
really<00:00:38.960> use<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.770> hard<00:00:40.430> drive<00:00:40.579> publish

really use the hard drive publish

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.090 
really use the hard drive publish
services<00:00:41.500> whenever<00:00:42.500> we're<00:00:42.710> exporting<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
services whenever we're exporting the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.400

settings<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.210> cool<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.840> will

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
settings that's cool you know will

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.480 
settings that's cool you know will
actually<00:02:31.440> leave<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> hundred<00:02:32.160> percent

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
actually leave this is a hundred percent

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.670 
actually leave this is a hundred percent
because<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.390> don't<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.110> worry<00:02:34.230> about<00:02:34.320> size

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
because I don't have to worry about size

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.840 
because I don't have to worry about size
because<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.130> not<00:02:35.250> going<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.520> my<00:02:35.610> personal

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
because it's not going to my personal

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.300 
because it's not going to my personal
websites<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.480> into<00:02:36.630> Facebook<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.310> Facebook

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
websites go into Facebook and Facebook

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.980 
websites go into Facebook and Facebook
is<00:02:38.430> gonna<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.790> its<00:02:38.940> own<00:02:39.060> optimization<00:02:39.750> there

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
is gonna do its own optimization there

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.130 
is gonna do its own optimization there
and<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.760> size<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.480> whatever<00:02:43.020> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and then I have to size it to whatever I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and then I have to size it to whatever I
want<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.470> want<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.710> leave<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:43.980> full

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
want I don't want to leave it as full

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.700 
want I don't want to leave it as full
resolution<00:02:44.600> I'll<00:02:45.600> leave<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:45.990> 800<00:02:46.380> pixels

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
resolution I'll leave it as 800 pixels

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.460 
resolution I'll leave it as 800 pixels
on<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.890> long<00:02:47.070> edge<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.720> you'll<00:02:48.990> notice<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
on the long edge and you'll notice that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.840 
on the long edge and you'll notice that
the<00:02:49.680> resolution<00:02:50.130> settings<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.820> been

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
the resolution settings have been

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.610 
the resolution settings have been
removed<00:02:51.240> because<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> web

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
removed because it's going to the web

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.050 
removed because it's going to the web
and<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:52.950> automatically<00:02:53.460> it<00:02:53.580> knows<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.790> this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and so automatically it knows that this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.410 
and so automatically it knows that this
has<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.450> 72<00:02:54.900> pixels<00:02:55.290> I'm<00:02:56.250> gonna<00:02:56.460> do<00:02:56.670> sharpen

has to be 72 pixels I'm gonna do sharpen

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.840 
has to be 72 pixels I'm gonna do sharpen
for<00:02:57.690> screen<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.200> we'll<00:02:58.290> do<00:02:58.380> hi<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.640> rest<00:02:59.790> of
