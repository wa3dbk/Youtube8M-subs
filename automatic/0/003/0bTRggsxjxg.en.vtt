00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
picture in it but whatever this is young

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.269 
picture in it but whatever this is young
when<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> had<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.390> room<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
when I had in my room so this is

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.169 
when I had in my room so this is
actually<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.140> metallic<00:00:28.140> still<00:00:28.890> life<00:00:29.150> which<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
actually a metallic still life which is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.849 
actually a metallic still life which is
why<00:00:30.449> there's<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:30.990> reflections<00:00:31.679> like

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
why there's a lot of reflections like

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.430 
why there's a lot of reflections like
the<00:00:32.040> ball<00:00:32.219> right<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.899> when<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:33.960> try<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the ball right there when i try not to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.069 
the ball right there when i try not to
touch<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.649> because<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> touch<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.640> it's

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
touch it because if you touch it it's

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.330 
touch it because if you touch it it's
going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> smear<00:00:37.469> no<00:00:37.710> mess<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> entire
