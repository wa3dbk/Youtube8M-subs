seconds<00:00:10.800> ago<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.490> had<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> little<00:00:11.969> look

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
seconds ago and I just had a little look

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
seconds ago and I just had a little look
at<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.650> looks<00:00:13.860> at<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.070> right<00:00:14.190> actually

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
at it and it looks at all right actually

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.599 
at it and it looks at all right actually
you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.730> choose<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.450> parenting<00:00:16.199> stuff

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
you can choose your parenting stuff

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.540 
you can choose your parenting stuff
which<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> crazy<00:00:18.090> which<00:00:18.510> obviously<00:00:18.869> will

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
which is crazy which obviously will

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.189 
which is crazy which obviously will
determine<00:00:20.550> what<00:00:20.760> how<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.119> go<00:00:21.390> look<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.869> stuff

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
determine what how you go look and stuff

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.710 
determine what how you go look and stuff
so<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.850> don't<00:00:24.150> care<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.449> that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720

your skills of you and obviously if you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
your skills of you and obviously if you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you're gonna have more stamina and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
you're gonna have more stamina and
driving<00:01:10.140> skills<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.710> reason<00:01:11.040> playing

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
driving skills for some reason playing

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.320 
driving skills for some reason playing
sports<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.210> increase<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.950> strength<00:01:14.330> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
sports will increase your strength so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.649 
sports will increase your strength so
this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.540> interesting<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.509> see

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this is interesting so as you can see

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
this is interesting so as you can see
each<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:20.060> change<00:01:21.060> your

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
each of these will actually change your

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
each of these will actually change your
skills<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.020> increase<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.280> decrease

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
skills and increase them and decrease

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.580 
skills and increase them and decrease
them<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.540> i<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> best<00:01:25.259> thing<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.560> just

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
them so i think the best thing is just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.210 
them so i think the best thing is just
have<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> max<00:01:27.600> level<00:01:28.290> I'm

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
have all these to the max level I'm

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.210 
have all these to the max level I'm
that's<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.960> choose<00:01:31.220> but

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that's that's what I would choose but

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
that's that's what I would choose but
just<00:01:32.850> change<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> character<00:01:33.689> base<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just change the character base so you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
just change the character base so you
can<00:01:34.439> choose<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.650> age<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.189> 21<00:01:35.520> 24<00:01:36.450> years<00:01:36.780> old

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
can choose your age from 21 24 years old

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.730 
can choose your age from 21 24 years old
I<00:01:37.320> don't<00:01:37.950> choose<00:01:38.159> 21<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> realize

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I don't choose 21 here you can realize

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.660 
I don't choose 21 here you can realize
take<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> hat<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.579> you
