 hello dear friends glad 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.190
 greet you on my channel 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.580
 today continue the theme of the replacement runners 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:27.449
 Received a question from the subscriber 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 which I will answer in this video first 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.690
 the question I was asked in the comments 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 this is if lightning is completely gone 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.489
 that is, you have to boots 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 the runner is not there either it is broken and lightning 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.989
 sold not claim to authorship 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 spied one person too on u 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.000
 tuba but in the comments ask him a question 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.180
 what kind of device is he on this question 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 answered so I decided to show you 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 that is, it is a doggy that is 1 course 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 in half 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 This is a dog that is not sorry just 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 which me and so you just plain 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:15.270
 paste it in here paste it in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:19.140
 start our slider bottom pull in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 fingers and holding shares start to lead 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.220
 see it all fasten like this 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.150
 pro and zip it on the boots 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 if you are not even there at the bottom of the combined 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 cloves then you can simply manually 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 the first three teeth can be joined manually 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:52.240
 but then use the miracle 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:56.590
 technology here and so what was bad 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.330
 seen in the previous video, these are these 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 they tails after removing our 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.560
 limiters they are anyway lower here 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.360
 thickening here goes and therefore through them 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.290
 runner is very bad so how 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.750
 fight it 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.769
 when you have it laid like this that is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 part sewn 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:23.230
 you get this lightning 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.750
 just take the thin round pliers and here 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.989
 remember these places do not bite and not 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.440
 incise namely rinse and because 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.690
 you have your slider removed removed 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 when he leaves the groove anyway 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.670
 that is, he once appeared to know that we 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:46.709
 crawled just remember these places and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.440
 this side is the same at the entrance 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.360
 this way you give way to the runner 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.820
 here we have it originally laid 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.010
 right 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.010
 we commemorate these places edge 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:15.310
 and insert our slider over this place 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.079
 i take a runner like this 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.560
 goes through these thickenings 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:26.310
 all basically pasted now we breed 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:33.819
 aside and he went we put a limiter 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.889
 the slider is ready 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:40.139
 video put likes subscribe to
