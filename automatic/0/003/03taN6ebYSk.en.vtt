00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.960
 which makes me very happy because there 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.330
 had a lot of people who 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.130
 asked for champions this time I was 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.560
 free of my choice so I chose a 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.900
 the most mysterious champion of the 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.360
 League of Legends 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.670
 it comes from a part of valorem that 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.870
 we have already studied a little bit with 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.890
 nasus if you watched the video 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.350

 maheas menu it also comes 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.500

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.720
 melancholy mummy to mu is considered 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.200
 as being a pain sufferer 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.690
 we're going to say a tank that takes the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.520
 damage without really feeling my 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.920
 about his skills he is endowed with 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 curse fingers I have two 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.979
 desperate wraps anger curse 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.140
 of a menu we start directly his 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.900
 story then you will see you 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.110
 do not go to take more than you do 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 think think but we're still going 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.260
 study some key points 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.910
 and where do we go things go wrong when 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 mu tears are worse 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.580
 when mu is angry and this real the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.470
 yodel called mu is probably one 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.660
 the weirdest champions of the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.820
 league of legends his life before he 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.910
 join the league is a mystery even 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.320
 for a menu that he remembers 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.720
 it is to have woken alone in a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.210
 pyramid of the sherry desert but he 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.640
 was wrapped with strips and he did not 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.350
 felt more his price beat for 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.490
 an unknown reason he felt a 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.830
 deep sadness 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.140
 his parents miss him but he gets 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.000
 did not remember who he was a menu 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.750
 collapsed and started to cry in these 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 strips 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.370
 whatever he did he could not 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.570
 to stop crying to be sad he 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.580
 finally get up 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.180
 ready to explore the world for 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.790
 discover his past a mu paced all 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.460
 the roads south of valora 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.700
 which in itself represents a feat 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.750
 considerable 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.640
 some but he did not have much 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.459
 learned about his past but he had 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.780
 understood that he had become 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.760
 he was perhaps a living dead 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.500
 yet his appearance was not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.150
 any features of the creatures that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.700
 this term is normally referred to 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.920
 he also seems able to hold on to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.450
 distance the problems because he had been able 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.100
 to cross all the south of lorraine 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.860
 without anything happening to him 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.930
 he was simply sad and 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.330
 all people all beings who 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.240
 met on his shared trip 7 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.130
 in the end he headed for the 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.830
 north crossed the Great Barrier and 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.870
 mitigates the institute of war the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.310
 summoners he encountered were 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.070
 fascinated by his story 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.500
 so much so that he invited him rapacious and 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.660
 the judgment of the league through his 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.100
 success as a champion and has 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.400
 finally been able to find what they 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.540
 had been searching for so long a home 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.790
 now that they own a present 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 he just wants his new 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.480
 friends help him discover his past 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.050
 that's the story of amine a story 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.959
 really very interesting even though the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.660
 mystery always remains present us 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.820
 know he has so he was awake 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.580
 he woke up in a pyramid of 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.400
 schematic that it's apparently an eye 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.060
 order so we already know who comes from 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.800
 bundle and that he spent his whole life 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.010
 finally his whole existence since he 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.980
 is in this form to look for his 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.870
 passed without really succeeding 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.650
 and in the end he joined 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.620
 the league of legends because it was 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.889
 a place a home will say that they 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.320
 matter a lot to him then the 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.639
 little details that happen in these 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.010
 relationships we annie who is very 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.370
 very good friends of better friends and a 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.860
 other side given his childlike appearance 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.460
 I think that's why they 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.720
 feel as good with this character 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.270
 during the contagious epidemic 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.410
 the institute of war so there I have not 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.550
 still did this story but you 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.560
 do not worry we will not be long in arriving 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.080
 at me had the mandatory vaccine the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.400
 nurses home part hence his 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:01.160
 appearance so we can see this skin 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.139
 come from there that's for this champion then 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.210
 unfortunately it's a pity that we 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.910
 not learn healthier I sought not 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.530
 badly but there are not many indexes 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.270
 for the boyfriend better I hope his 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.360
 history that will one day j 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.040
