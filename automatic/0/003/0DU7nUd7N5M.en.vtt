00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and this one made me think about

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.580 
and this one made me think about
multiplayer<00:00:29.220> again<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.510> question<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.619 
facilitate sort of plane on plane combat
like<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.250> simply<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.820> multiplayer<00:00:42.360> game

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
like that's simply the multiplayer game

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you could even spawn in a plane and you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
you could even spawn in a plane and you
know<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.480> fight<00:00:48.719> over<00:00:48.870> Los<00:00:49.170> Santos<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
parachute that would make it kind of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.700 
parachute that would make it kind of
interesting<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.690> yeah<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:58.260> maybe<00:00:58.410> have

things like that or you know he's not a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
things like that or you know he's not a
rifle<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.830> could<00:01:04.949> try<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.159> snipe

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
rifle as you could try and snipe

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
rifle as you could try and snipe
somebody<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> plane<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.650> there's<00:01:07.920> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
somebody out of a plane like there's so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
somebody out of a plane like there's so
much<00:01:08.250> potential<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.850> multiplayer<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
much potential for multiplayer and I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.710 
much potential for multiplayer and I
don't<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.409> whether<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> possible

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
don't know whether it's possible

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
don't know whether it's possible
technically<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> multiplayer

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
technically for that kind of multiplayer

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.469 
technically for that kind of multiplayer
to<00:01:15.150> happen<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.229> draw<00:01:16.530> distance<00:01:16.590> on

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
to happen like the draw distance on

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.490 
to happen like the draw distance on
aircrafts<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.540> things<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.259> don't

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
aircrafts and things like that I don't

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.690 
aircrafts and things like that I don't
know<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> sort<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> stuff<00:01:20.640> works

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
know how that sort of stuff works

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.270 
know how that sort of stuff works
technically<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.979> really

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
technically but it would be really

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
technically but it would be really
really<00:01:23.520> awesome<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.560> like<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
really awesome if like to get into a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
really awesome if like to get into a
plane<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.939> friend<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> plane

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
plane my friend could get into a plane

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.580 
plane my friend could get into a plane
and<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.119> one<00:01:30.869> customizer

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and you know we could one customizer

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.109 
and you know we could one customizer
planes<00:01:31.920> that'll<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.280> pretty<00:01:32.460> awesome<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
planes that'll be pretty awesome but you

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.249 
planes that'll be pretty awesome but you
guys<00:01:33.240> seem<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
guys seem to think that's not going to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
guys seem to think that's not going to
happen<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> will<00:01:36.119> either<00:01:36.390> but

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
happen I don't think it will either but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.800 
happen I don't think it will either but

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
again her be cool if it did but then we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.130 
again her be cool if it did but then we
could<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.560> one-on-one<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.140> do

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
could you know go one-on-one and just do

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
could you know go one-on-one and just do
some<00:01:43.350> dogfighting<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.220> try<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:45.329> each

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.670 
some dogfighting just try and take each
other<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.140> plane<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.590> be

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
other out and a plane that would be

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
other out and a plane that would be
awesome<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.149> could<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.540> with

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
awesome because you could do that with

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
awesome because you could do that with
helicopters<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.890> planes<00:01:50.189> move

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
helicopters but you know planes move

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.850 
helicopters but you know planes move
faster<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.840> past<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> land<00:01:52.560> really

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
faster they go past the land really

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.270 
faster they go past the land really
quick<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.210> awesome<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:55.100> see<00:01:56.100> that
