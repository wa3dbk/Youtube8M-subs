non-destructive photo editor and what
that<00:00:43.059> means<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:44.970> let's<00:00:45.970> think<00:00:46.180> about<00:00:46.239> it<00:00:46.420> like

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
that means is let's think about it like

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.290 
that means is let's think about it like
this<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:46.899> everybody<00:00:47.800> remember<00:00:48.190> back<00:00:48.579> when<00:00:48.850> you

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
sentence structure and all this fun

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.290 
sentence structure and all this fun
stuff<00:00:54.570> remember<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.660> overhead<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:58.180> was

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
that thing called overhead projector and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.380 
that thing called overhead projector and
that<00:01:00.489> you'd<00:01:00.699> have<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.850> piece<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.059> paper<00:01:01.180> on

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.600 
that you'd have a piece of paper on
there<00:01:01.570> with<00:01:01.750> Sally<00:01:02.260> threw<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.890> ball<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.129> gym

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
there with Sally threw the ball to gym

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.060 
there with Sally threw the ball to gym
in<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.059> park<00:01:04.330> or<00:01:04.600> whatever<00:01:04.899> it<00:01:05.020> was<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
in the park or whatever it was and the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.580 
in the park or whatever it was and the
teacher<00:01:06.340> would<00:01:06.550> set<00:01:06.759> that<00:01:06.940> clear<00:01:07.590> transparent

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
teacher would set that clear transparent

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.880 
teacher would set that clear transparent
plastic<00:01:09.300> sheet<00:01:10.300> over<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.259> she<00:01:11.410> would<00:01:11.530> mark

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
plastic sheet over it and she would mark

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.060 
plastic sheet over it and she would mark
on<00:01:12.100> top<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:14.080> would<00:01:14.229> that<00:01:14.680> was<00:01:14.800> you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
on top of that that would that was you

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.130 
on top of that that would that was you
know<00:01:15.190> non-destructive<00:01:16.090> she<00:01:16.240> wasn't<00:01:16.539> marking

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
know non-destructive she wasn't marking

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.740 
know non-destructive she wasn't marking
on<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.380> paper<00:01:17.619> so<00:01:18.310> essentially<00:01:18.940> Lightroom

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
on the paper so essentially Lightroom

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.609 
on the paper so essentially Lightroom
works<00:01:19.959> the<00:01:20.110> same<00:01:20.140> way<00:01:21.209> Lightroom<00:01:22.380> works<00:01:23.380> on

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
works the same way Lightroom works on

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.550 
works the same way Lightroom works on
catalogs<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:25.209> a<00:01:25.240> catalog<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.020> got<00:01:26.170> Lightroom

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
catalogs so a catalog you got Lightroom

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.669 
catalogs so a catalog you got Lightroom
here<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.580> catalog<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:28.390> like<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:29.020> roadmap

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
here and a catalog is like the roadmap

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.190 
here and a catalog is like the roadmap
for<00:01:29.709> library<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:30.970> have<00:01:31.119> our<00:01:31.149> folder<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:32.020> our

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
for library so we have our folder of our

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.350 
for library so we have our folder of our
raw<00:01:32.470> files<00:01:32.830> these<00:01:33.190> are<00:01:33.459> unedited<00:01:33.759> raw<00:01:34.090> files

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
raw files these are unedited raw files

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.490 
raw files these are unedited raw files
straight<00:01:34.569> off<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.810> memory<00:01:35.080> card<00:01:35.289> off<00:01:35.410> the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
straight off the memory card off the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.160 
straight off the memory card off the
camera<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.009> then<00:01:36.550> we<00:01:37.000> want<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.479> that's<00:01:38.020> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
camera and then we want to that's the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.139 
camera and then we want to that's the
start<00:01:38.440> we<00:01:38.590> want<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.800> get<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.069> finish<00:01:39.280> which

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
start we want to get to the finish which

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.559 
start we want to get to the finish which
is<00:01:40.179> an<00:01:40.599> exported<00:01:41.440> edited.jpg<00:01:42.310> files<00:01:42.610> so

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
is an exported edited.jpg files so

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.870 
is an exported edited.jpg files so
Lightroom<00:01:44.259> being<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:44.890> non-destructive<00:01:45.369> photo

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
Lightroom being a non-destructive photo

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.479 
Lightroom being a non-destructive photo
editor<00:01:46.239> works<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.959> these<00:01:47.080> catalogs<00:01:47.739> so<00:01:48.310> the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:48.489 
editor works on these catalogs so the

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:50.760 
editor works on these catalogs so the
catalogs<00:01:49.030> are<00:01:49.270> basically<00:01:49.959> little<00:01:50.259> road<00:01:50.500> maps

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
catalogs are basically little road maps

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.190 
catalogs are basically little road maps
that<00:01:51.009> say<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:52.420> give<00:01:52.630> directions<00:01:52.989> to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that say just give directions to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.770 
that say just give directions to
Lightroom<00:01:53.590> this<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.009> where<00:01:54.220> this<00:01:54.789> file<00:01:55.390> is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
Lightroom this is where this file is

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.620 
Lightroom this is where this file is
photo<00:01:56.259> is<00:01:56.470> located<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.700> it'll<00:01:58.090> give<00:01:58.239> access<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
photo is located so it'll give access to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.080 
photo is located so it'll give access to
that<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.110> then<00:01:59.319> it<00:02:00.009> being<00:02:00.190> non-destructive

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
that and then it being non-destructive

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.809 
that and then it being non-destructive
every<00:02:01.869> single<00:02:02.349> time<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.619> make<00:02:03.039> an<00:02:03.220> edit<00:02:03.489> is

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
every single time you make an edit is

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.210 
every single time you make an edit is
going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.509> show<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:04.989> the<00:02:05.289> history<00:02:05.830> bar<00:02:06.009> over

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
going to show up in the history bar over

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.180 
going to show up in the history bar over
here<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.030> can<00:02:07.330> go<00:02:07.479> back<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:08.110> as<00:02:08.770> many

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
here so you can go back to as many

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.360 
here so you can go back to as many
things<00:02:09.759> as<00:02:09.970> you've<00:02:10.179> ever<00:02:10.390> done<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:12.129> photo

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
things as you've ever done to the photo

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.059 
things as you've ever done to the photo
you<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.420> anything<00:02:13.780> anything<00:02:14.770> you've<00:02:15.040> done

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
you can do anything anything you've done

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.920 
you can do anything anything you've done
you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.819> go<00:02:15.940> back<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.120> undo<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.720> it's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you can go back and undo it it's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.930 
you can go back and undo it it's
non-destructive<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:18.010> basically<00:02:18.670> that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
non-destructive it's basically that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.140 
non-destructive it's basically that
transparent<00:02:19.870> sheet<00:02:20.560> over<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> paper<00:02:21.220> showing

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
transparent sheet over the paper showing
