00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.480 
for the camera for the front and the
back<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:25.490> still

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
back so that when you have it you still

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.510 
back so that when you have it you still
have<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> camera<00:01:27.000> feature<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> rare

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.600 
have the camera feature for the rare
which<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> cool<00:01:30.829> another<00:01:31.829> cool<00:01:32.009> thing<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
which is cool another cool thing is that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
which is cool another cool thing is that
it<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.360> magnetic<00:01:33.780> strips<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.470> when

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it does have the magnetic strips so when

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.620 
it does have the magnetic strips so when
you<00:01:34.829> open<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.189> turns<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.880> instantly<00:01:38.479> as<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you open it turns on instantly as you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.100 
you open it turns on instantly as you
can<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.689> turns<00:01:42.930> off<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.530> on

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.560 

so<00:01:49.040> that's<00:01:49.220> pretty<00:01:49.400> cool<00:01:51.070> now<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.420> what<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
so that's pretty cool now the what the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.090 
so that's pretty cool now the what the
things<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:53.990> don't<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.650> much<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:54.890> that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
things that I don't like so much is that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.380 
things that I don't like so much is that
it<00:01:55.520> does<00:01:55.730> rise<00:01:56.030> up<00:01:57.040> right<00:01:58.040> here<00:01:58.340> add<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.300> little

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390

to open it so that is blocked I wish it

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.930 
to open it so that is blocked I wish it
was<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.020> other<00:02:42.050> side<00:02:42.489> that's<00:02:43.489> while<00:02:43.640> also

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
was on the other side that's while also

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.810 
was on the other side that's while also
being<00:02:44.270> right-handed<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:45.560> know<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.040> mean<00:02:46.760> I

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
being right-handed you know I mean I

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.250 
being right-handed you know I mean I
guess<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> open<00:02:47.330> up<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.480> book<00:02:47.660> left<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.050> right

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
guess you open up a book left to right

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.780 
guess you open up a book left to right
so<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.500> does<00:02:48.620> make<00:02:48.650> sense<00:02:48.950> for<00:02:49.250> some<00:02:49.430> reason

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
so it does make sense for some reason

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.710 
so it does make sense for some reason
like<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.390> my<00:02:51.880> nexus<00:02:52.880> 7<00:02:53.180> cover<00:02:53.420> open

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
like when I have my nexus 7 cover open

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.570 
like when I have my nexus 7 cover open
it<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.920> then<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.190> get<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.370> do

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
it up like that and then you get to do

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.280 
it up like that and then you get to do
whatever<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:58.820> does<00:02:59.000> rotate<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.840> way<00:03:00.049> but

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
whatever and it does rotate this way but

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.660 
whatever and it does rotate this way but
certain<00:03:00.530> apps<00:03:00.739> like<00:03:01.269> Instagram<00:03:03.489> only<00:03:04.489> come<00:03:04.640> up

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
certain apps like Instagram only come up

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.300 
certain apps like Instagram only come up
the<00:03:04.880> other<00:03:05.000> way<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.720> little<00:03:05.870> bit<00:03:06.310> other

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the other way so it's a little bit other

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.460 
the other way so it's a little bit other
than<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:07.910> know<00:03:08.049> we<00:03:09.049> wait<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> long<00:03:09.440> time

than that you know we wait a long time

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.030 
than that you know we wait a long time
