 push I hope it's going today 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.300
 we end up for a video that is 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.190
 very very very special if I tell you 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.670
 play with 202 fps 200 images per 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.730
 second 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.879
 I made you a video and some 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.120
 time that this optimal configuration 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.820
 your fps so if you have a pc that 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.690
 turned pretty well turn you 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.850
 normally at 125 constant fps there we go 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.010
 talk about 200f ps to give you a 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.580
 order is the players who make 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.860
 the lines on esl that makes use of that 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.680
 I will talk to you there now and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.799
 it's simply grandiose 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 so I'll already go back to options 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.500
 settings this is my configuration to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.509
 me if you have a pc that is less 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.950
 powerful it will take down the 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.610
 screen resolution or quality of 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.070
 filtering textures and all that for the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.480
 people who have a computer we are going 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.390
 to say okay I'll give you the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.530
 configuration that you need so you 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.110
 play in 1920 by 1080 sas and we will say 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.470
 logic into a field of view you put 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.979
 90 shadow without rag doll without 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.860
 player name indicators ready to 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.560
 do you put abbreviated meta here 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.950
 Shepherd is blood- colored apart for 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.619
 my friend yoyo 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.049
 message castle do not care you go away 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.939
 in before his qualities texture me I 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.709
 can put bonus it does not change anything 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.959
 after I advise you to put weather 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.090
 to you change you put in Ã¥ if you 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.560
 see that it does not work too much 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.090
 go down to you put in normal but 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.569
 I think that from normal 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.519
 should not work well so my 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.950
 bonus management texture filtering 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.799
 it's the same weather 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.310
 after you go down the quality then 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.610
 on your anti-aliased pc I put 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.500
 100 fx to you not included 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.349
 ambient I have not put depth of 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.079
 field that's when in fact you're aiming for the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.730
 quality we will say the quality of the bottom of 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:52.250
 your game is more or less blurry 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.019
 so I put in weak room like 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
 that's where it's where you really need 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.239
 do what I tell you synchronization 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.180
 every picture you put no disable 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.799
 maximum image per second in the video 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.250
 of the time I told you I had you 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.760
 says the master to 120 donations that actually makes your 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.370
 limited game your frames per second to 120 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.319
 or 125 could not climb anymore there you 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.139
 go on unlimited 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.459
 you display your fps like that you 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:24.950
 will see the result 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.870
 by cons I will not leave on a 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.200
 server because actually as I film 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.959
 with fraps fraps takes me 60 images by 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.510
 second to film so you will not see 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.389
 200 f ps of people but that's what 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.100
 hold on top right here so I'll you 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:45.109
 let do let yourself and 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.019
 you will tell me some news 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:52.239
 after in audio on it you put 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.350
 nothing voice chat that was nothing either 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.200
 and 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.530
 there we will surely go on my screen of 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.330
 pc 1 so I tell you right away the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.640
 time to do the little manip and then 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.800

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.820
 game booster on your desktop 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.360
 once that's done you double

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.970
 that you have on your computer 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.560
 and if it does like me sometimes that I 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.770
 the installed call of duty 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.890
 so the game and the game we play 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.300

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.610
 if it's like me you click on the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.770
 small icon the square with the most apt 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.470
 you click once on it and you 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.130
 go find the shortcut 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.630
 normally who settled 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.810
 automatically when you have installed 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.060

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.870
 on it and it will appear in among the 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.290
 other games on your computer 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:50.950
 once it's done you can 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.510
 close this window and you do 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.770
 you will leave me I can not 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.390
 test because I did not find that the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.110
 solution apparently when I run the 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.430
 game and I film with studio cam that 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.920
 bugger my computer 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.450
 so you're going to have a little job 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.400
 it's going to test everything I 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.910
 just told you and you will tell me if 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.460
 it really does not work after once 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.800
 that software there so it is installed 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.510
 you do as usual 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.940
 click double click on call of duty 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.040
 black ops multiplying on steam the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.160
 game will launch automatically and you 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.250
 go see that razer game booster is going 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.840
 you clear everything that will not be everything 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.780
 which will be useless during your 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.870
 playing time which will allow you to 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.810
 recover from the ram your teacher your 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.110
 processor will be less overloaded so in 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:44.800
 does your graphics card processor 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:47.080
 ram will focus on your game and 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.820
 your game so will turn a lot more 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.680
 quick 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.060
 from where the 200 fps finally me 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.340
 personally my computer allows me 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.330
 to play 200 fps 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.740
 if your computer is a little less 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.300
 powerful you will still turn to 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:04.600
 say the 150 160 head or 170 that's 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.480
 always better than 125 even 625 this game 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.330
 was already a lot more fluid and 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.950
 with 62 fps so listen I hope that 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.870
 this will be of great use to you 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.540
 if you 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.890
