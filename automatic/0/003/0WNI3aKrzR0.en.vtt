00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
has the gray wire on my bike it might be

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
has the gray wire on my bike it might be
the<00:01:37.259> top<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.710> other<00:01:37.890> bikes<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.549> best<00:01:38.759> way<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the top on other bikes the best way to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.690 
the top on other bikes the best way to
find<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.450> I've<00:01:39.930> found<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:41.130> two<00:01:41.460> wires

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
find it I've found is there's two wires

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
find it I've found is there's two wires
that<00:01:41.820> surround<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> blue<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> white

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that surround it a blue with a white

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.740 
that surround it a blue with a white
stripe<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> red<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> black<00:01:45.210> stripe<00:01:45.390> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
stripe and red with a black stripe in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.190 
stripe and red with a black stripe in
between<00:01:46.259> those<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> gray<00:01:47.430> wire<00:01:48.200> it'll

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
between those two is the gray wire it'll

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.039 
between those two is the gray wire it'll
make<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:49.799> bit<00:01:50.040> easier<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.689> cut

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
make it a little bit easier if you cut

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.289 
make it a little bit easier if you cut
some<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> zip<00:01:53.220> ties<00:01:53.460> holding<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
some of the zip ties holding it just

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
some of the zip ties holding it just
remember<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:54.810> ones<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.229> cut<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
remember which ones you cut so you can

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.819 
remember which ones you cut so you can
replace<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.180> done<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> can

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
replace them when you're done so you can

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.670 
replace them when you're done so you can
see<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.490> black<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.060> red<00:02:00.119> wire<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.200> blue<00:02:01.469> wire

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
see the black and red wire the blue wire

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.889 
see the black and red wire the blue wire
with<00:02:01.890> white<00:02:02.159> stripe<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> gray<00:02:03.630> wire

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
with white stripe and then the gray wire

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
with white stripe and then the gray wire
in<00:02:04.140> between<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.740> two<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:06.420> disconnect<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
in between the two to disconnect this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
in between the two to disconnect this
plug<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:07.950> should<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> small<00:02:08.690> plastic<00:02:09.690> tab

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
plug there should be a small plastic tab

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.460 
plug there should be a small plastic tab
that<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.440> push<00:02:10.860> forward<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.640> pull<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that you can push forward and pull the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.490 
that you can push forward and pull the
a plug<00:02:13.860> apart<00:02:14.780> next<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> cut<00:02:16.470> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
a plug apart next I'm going to cut a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.550 
a plug apart next I'm going to cut a
little<00:02:17.070> bit<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.520> protective<00:02:18.300> cover<00:02:18.570> off

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
little bit of this protective cover off

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.030 
little bit of this protective cover off
the<00:02:20.340> cable<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.090> easier<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.690> two

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
