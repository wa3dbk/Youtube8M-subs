00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
streak that she picked just like the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.760 
streak that she picked just like the
ones<00:04:59.100> you<00:04:59.190> pick<00:04:59.370> now<00:04:59.690> it<00:05:00.690> was<00:05:00.870> 25<00:05:01.320> kills<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.710> a

would<00:05:15.780> get<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.110> 14<00:05:16.560> kills<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.280> really<00:05:17.640> all<00:05:17.790> you

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
would get you 14 kills so really all you

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.280 
would get you 14 kills so really all you
needed<00:05:18.150> was<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.360> seven<00:05:18.690> kill<00:05:18.870> streak<00:05:19.080> for<00:05:19.200> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.680 
needed was a seven kill streak for the
most<00:05:19.500> part<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:20.190> earn<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.340> newt<00:05:20.640> so<00:05:21.360> how<00:05:21.510> they

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
most part to earn a newt so how they

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.000 
most part to earn a newt so how they
thought<00:05:21.930> those<00:05:22.080> will<00:05:22.260> be<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.380> challenge<00:05:22.890> is

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
