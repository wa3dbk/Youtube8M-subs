guess<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.220> could<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.400> add<00:02:15.849> all<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.209> this<00:02:17.489> you

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
guess I could just add all of this you

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.430 
guess I could just add all of this you
there<00:02:18.880> wiggly<00:02:19.330> can<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.599> see<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:19.930> Wiggly<00:02:20.290> they

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
there wiggly can you see how Wiggly they

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.920 
there wiggly can you see how Wiggly they
are<00:02:21.330> bring<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.510> up<00:02:22.720> closer<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:25.120> they're<00:02:25.480> just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
are bring it up closer and they're just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.130 
are bring it up closer and they're just
a<00:02:26.050> big<00:02:26.260> heap<00:02:27.390> worms<00:02:28.390> don't<00:02:28.600> really<00:02:28.870> creep<00:02:29.110> me

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
a big heap worms don't really creep me

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.449 
a big heap worms don't really creep me
out<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:29.680> much<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.569> rodents<00:02:31.569> do<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
out as much as a rodents do so now this

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.550 
out as much as a rodents do so now this
has<00:02:33.519> packing<00:02:34.060> tape<00:02:34.180> maybe<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.720> add<00:02:35.019> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.960 

but<00:02:38.560> they<00:02:38.709> look<00:02:38.739> really<00:02:39.280> good<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.250> I'm

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
but they look really good and so I'm

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.400 
but they look really good and so I'm
going<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.209> let<00:02:43.330> them<00:02:43.540> enjoy<00:02:43.690> their<00:02:44.080> new<00:02:44.200> home

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
going to let them enjoy their new home

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.590 
going to let them enjoy their new home
and<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:44.920> I'm<00:02:44.980> going<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.130> add<00:02:45.310> some<00:02:45.600> wet

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
and then I'm going to add some wet

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.940 
and then I'm going to add some wet
newspaper<00:02:47.049> on<00:02:47.230> top<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.739> keep<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.190> moist<00:02:48.400> um

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
newspaper on top to keep it moist um

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.289 
newspaper on top to keep it moist um
where<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:50.980> want<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.610> place<00:02:51.819> your<00:02:51.850> worm<00:02:52.239> farm

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
where you want to place your worm farm

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.309 
where you want to place your worm farm
is<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.799> area<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.880> doesn't<00:02:55.630> get<00:02:55.840> too<00:02:56.290> much

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
is in a area that doesn't get too much

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.610 
is in a area that doesn't get too much
Sun<00:02:56.769> morning<00:02:57.640> Sun<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.090> okay<00:02:58.420> afternoon<00:02:59.170> Sun<00:02:59.440> is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
Sun morning Sun is okay afternoon Sun is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.880 
Sun morning Sun is okay afternoon Sun is
not<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.630> decided<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.290> spot<00:03:02.680> right

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
not and so I decided this spot right

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.449 
not and so I decided this spot right
here<00:03:03.600> should<00:03:04.600> be<00:03:04.690> fine<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.590> little<00:03:05.860> rainy

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
here should be fine it's a little rainy

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.110 
here should be fine it's a little rainy
on<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.480> off<00:03:07.600> today<00:03:07.870> but<00:03:08.110> um<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.160> checked<00:03:09.970> this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
on and off today but um I checked this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
on and off today but um I checked this
out<00:03:10.359> when<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:10.780> empty<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.350> there<00:03:11.920> wasn't

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
out when it was empty and there wasn't

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.680 
out when it was empty and there wasn't
that<00:03:12.250> much<00:03:12.459> water<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.269> think<00:03:13.420> it'll

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
that much water in it so I think it'll

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.410 
that much water in it so I think it'll
be<00:03:13.840> fine<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.410> mean<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.190> worms<00:03:15.400> live<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.299> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
be fine I mean the worms live in the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.900 
be fine I mean the worms live in the
dirt<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.930> think<00:03:17.140> about<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.530> they<00:03:17.880> deal<00:03:18.880> with

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
dirt and think about it they deal with

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.550 
dirt and think about it they deal with
rain<00:03:19.269> all<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.540> time<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:19.989> as<00:03:20.079> long<00:03:20.200> as<00:03:20.260> there's

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
rain all the time so as long as there's

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.140 
rain all the time so as long as there's
some<00:03:20.739> decent<00:03:21.070> drainage<00:03:21.609> I<00:03:21.730> think<00:03:21.910> they'll<00:03:22.030> be

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
some decent drainage I think they'll be

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.590 
some decent drainage I think they'll be
fine

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
fine

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.069 
fine
all<00:03:23.200> right<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.890> soon<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.910> will<00:03:25.299> hopefully<00:03:25.600> have

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
all right so soon I will hopefully have

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.620 
all right so soon I will hopefully have
some<00:03:26.440> nice<00:03:27.510> compost<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.840> worm<00:03:29.380> tea<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:30.630> will

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
some nice compost and worm tea I will

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.479 
some nice compost and worm tea I will
keep<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.959> updated<00:03:32.140> on<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.859> worm<00:03:33.010> farm<00:03:33.280> by<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
keep you updated on the worm farm by the

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.410 
keep you updated on the worm farm by the
way<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.940> worm<00:03:34.150> cafe<00:03:34.690> that's<00:03:35.019> in<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.620> garden

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
way the worm cafe that's in the garden

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.849 
way the worm cafe that's in the garden
is<00:03:37.420> doing<00:03:37.840> really<00:03:38.109> really<00:03:38.320> well

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
is doing really really well

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.120 
is doing really really well
the<00:03:39.790> worms<00:03:40.030> seem<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.810> cafe<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.470> check

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
the worms seem to like the cafe I check

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.400 
the worms seem to like the cafe I check
on<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.400> periodically<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.359> every<00:03:43.780> time<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.019> lift

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
on it periodically and every time I lift

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.710 
on it periodically and every time I lift
it<00:03:44.470> up<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.769> see<00:03:44.950> some<00:03:45.190> worms<00:03:45.730> hanging<00:03:46.180> around<00:03:46.450> so

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
it up I see some worms hanging around so

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.849 
it up I see some worms hanging around so
that's<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.170> good<00:03:47.350> sign

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
that's a good sign

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.240 
that's a good sign
and<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.850> if<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.780> don't<00:03:49.989> want<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.290> do<00:03:50.829> something

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
and so if you don't want to do something

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.530 
and so if you don't want to do something
like<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.609> might<00:03:51.970> want<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.239> think<00:03:52.390> about

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
like this you might want to think about

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.949 
like this you might want to think about
doing<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.959> worm<00:03:53.109> cafe<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:53.769> did<00:03:53.980> in<00:03:54.130> my

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
doing the worm cafe that I did in my

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.539 
doing the worm cafe that I did in my
garden<00:03:55.959> update<00:03:56.380> video<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.739> think<00:03:57.130> it's<00:03:57.250> number

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
garden update video I think it's number

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.330 
garden update video I think it's number
one<00:03:58.049> all<00:03:59.049> right<00:03:59.230> thanks<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.709> lot<00:03:59.739> thanks<00:04:00.220> for
