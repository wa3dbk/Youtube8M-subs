00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
really get you right that way even the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.470 
really get you right that way even the
point<00:03:48.950> where<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.669> jokes<00:03:49.940> about<00:03:50.120> him<00:03:50.329> coming

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480

in<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.870> rearranging<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.470> furniture<00:03:51.500> the

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
in and rearranging the furniture the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.759 
in and rearranging the furniture the
original<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:53.419> was<00:03:53.569> this<00:03:53.660> plan<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.290> think<00:03:54.680> it

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
original that was this plan I think it

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.069 
original that was this plan I think it
reminds<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> how<00:03:55.910> good<00:03:56.180> buildings<00:03:56.599> can<00:03:56.840> be
