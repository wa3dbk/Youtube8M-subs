00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello in the last tutorial on the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.870
 motion we talked about the texts of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.790
 paragraphs of text how to place them 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 in a motion project a little bit at the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.190
 way of a text editor 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 today we will work 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.870
 text animation trajectories then 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.470
 I go back to my text tool here I 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.350
 quickly snapped up for example hello at home 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.099
 you at home I'm going to fatten a little 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.140
 little this text here lo 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.010
 and now you can not be less 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 that's it and I lüthi text here I 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.239
 go to the presentation tab and there the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 type is not paragraph that I'm going 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 do but this trajectory 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 look what's up here I have three 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.899
 small flash animation points and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.940
 now binds us with three points 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.469
 under my text and if I play or watch 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 with the positioning of the point of 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 middle and I move the text follows the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 curve that I'm creating 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 like that I do not have beziers on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 which ones can I play that do I 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.120
 the Bezier points otherwise because 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.670
 its beginning at the end but I can 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.600
 create a right-click smoothing up and you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 go see I'm going to have points of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.530
 beziers on which I will be able 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 also play for my departure the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 curve be in Béziers the same for 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 the arrival we will see we are not obliged 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.549
 to do it we can double-click too 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.140
 there on the line to create another 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.350
 point I just created a point and that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 allows to create a trajectory 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 even more complex here like that I 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.430
 can the displaced brief points I 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.040
 can do an animal trajectory 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 completely personalized animation 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.100
 like that while having fun with the points 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.869
 then I'm a new point here a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 double clicking on it by compassion 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.750
 the letters rather on the line here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 I wrote another point that can 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 allow for example and there I would be 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.030
 rather like that it's more like that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 here how much to round it up and if we want 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.090
 to have 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.590
 this is an animation trajectory 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.360
 more flexible than we do like that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.740
 and our way is that the type of 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 trajectory in passing of beziers to big 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.040
 blinds are going to see that the wise or the big 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.509
 blind it plays on the tangent and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.130
 look at that much simpler create 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.020
 a very flexible trajectory of this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.829
 way there is better proceed in bis 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.439
 place to have a trajectory 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.719
 really well supple animation 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.129
 very flexible path of animation and after 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.929
 we can animated week of animations 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.569
 how by playing on the shift of the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.599
 trajectory named at the very beginning here of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.970
 my motion project I create a point 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.440
 of animation with the text at the beginning here 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.540
 then on shift of the trajectory 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.670
 animation points here up 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.200
 yes now it's going to move I'm going to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.180
 the end here a little bit before the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.770
 end alas my trajectory I do it 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.390
 move forward so that the text 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.370
 almost at the end of our victory 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.800
 like this and now if i re-read my 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.400
 project had to see context he strolls 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.050
 on the line it can be the letters 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.700
 can be aligned 1 on the tangent 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.050
 of the trajectory each letter is sure 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 the attention of the trajectory it is this 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.190
 little trick is checked by default but it 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.290
 can be also unchecked from some 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.140
 wings and watch the letters 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.280
 stay vertical good I prefer 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.120
 that they are aligned like that one 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.220
 can also the masters below to 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.319
 inside a trajectory like that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.819
 here look so that the trajectory 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.379
 be closed for its part 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.819
 trajectories closed it's settled here 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.940
 look open spin I'm going to do a 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.890
 closed spin - circle for example 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.810
 I have a circle with my letters that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.159
 turn around and the letters this time 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.140
 it can be inside the 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.610
 path 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.989
 so there on this animation work not 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.000
 really blow but look through 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.950
 example if I grew up my circle here 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.170
 will understand that the letters here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.239
 it may be interesting to have 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.190
 inside the trajectory we 're going 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.500
 racing reset the trajectory by 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.750
 example at the beginning of trajectory here I 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.750
 put an animation point and I'm going to 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.569
 put on that's it like this and at the end of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.000
 my trajectory 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.280
 here I 'll be sooner 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.690
 like that and so if I reread my text 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 I will enlarge it a little bit more 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.950
 my dear here's doing that I can 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.510
 customize then you see if I 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.440
 want it to be always round I'm typing 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.350
 on the sidelines 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.780
 I have at the same time and then here I'm going 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.260
 go on my arrow option for the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.150
 move the circle like this and watch if 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
 I read my trajectory 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.310
 does it give then there we see 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.420
 the longer the trajectory what I'm on 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.220
 the arrow tool it's funny out of the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.390
 blow if I put the trajectory back 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.560
 that I'm going on there so here 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.950
 I stop succeeding a little bit 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.020
 like that for example I'm going through 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.390
 lucky arrow to iron my 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.549
 path 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.160
 yes arrow tools and then we will come 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.760
 replace all that there my text look 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.760
 how animated he is 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.110
 here I select the text I go back 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.020
 on the arrow tool to see the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.620
 trajectory again this is my 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.030
 path 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.820
 I remember that I can still have a 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.070
 once dropped the size of the circle here 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.870
 relocated the text to the outside here the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.540
 go back through the arrow tool if I can 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.220
 get off all this here like this 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.620
 look what I feel like I read 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.770
 a text resulting from an animation trajectory 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.180
 like that and this trajectory 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.120
 of animation we can be inside 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.470
 or outside 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.030
 aligned or not align the letters to the 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.280
 vertical one can also have a 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:16.650
 front role I can be on a rectangle 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.650
 where I can be on waves too 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.670
 but wave here in frequency here I have 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.670
 q2 but look I can have two 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.670
 three 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.010
 and finally I can also make shapes 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.630
 which is called geometry then 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.430
 geometric like that on 0 it does not give 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.410
 great thing it allows to take by 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:44.890
 example the brush tool or the tool 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:47.460
 creating big blind and beziers here from 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.460
 create a shape 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.790
 bezze this form can be the 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.550
 make type 2 form big blind like that 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.770
 and I will apply to my text in 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.510
 text here I create them but I do not 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.700
 see I do not show it I use 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.410
 only like that as the source of my 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.750
 form and now look at my text 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:15.570
 he will actually resume his 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.830
 created trajectory look here in my 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.870
 court of beziers while I put it to 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.130
 start also like that and that 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.050
 enlarge it until the end of my 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.810
 project an easy text demon is going 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.440
 follow the cut of beziers of the form 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.290
 created I put a point a little bit and 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.060
 we can bring a form also and 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.520
 put it in form source here for 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.500
 that our text this time follows this 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.940
 shape so that's how to play with the 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.920
 text animation trajectories in 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.920
 motion thank you soon
