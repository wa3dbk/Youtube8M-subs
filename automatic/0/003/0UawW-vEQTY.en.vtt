00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.600
 as you can see we have changed 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.279
 slightly the location to try 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.230
 to hear us better because one of the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.390
 demands that we have had lately is 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.920
 the subject of the sun and not as you know we are 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.990
 an amateur and good channel within 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.550
 our possibilities every time 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.620
 we do more and every time we try 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.960
 so solve your demands for 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.960
 improve the channel among all the subject that 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.239
 we are dealing with today in our 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.050
 our way of serving each other 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.390
 questions is the doubts that have arisen to 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.260
 root of the last means that we 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 we did win forgiveness lose weight at 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.729
 same time you keep or want 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.879
 strength has come out a doubt because I in 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.589
 that video talked about exercises 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.900
 analytical strength is to say that at 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.729
 be is caloric deficit to lose 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.369
 weight because for slopes and we said 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.710
 that you had to be in caloric deficit 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.750
 always to maintain strength there was 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.659
 analytical exercises to do as 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.460
 well they have asked us a lot I mean 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.420
 with that then here I mean with that 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.400
 we will talk now 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.830
 and us in many of our videos 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.850
 we have recommended and we have said that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.070
 we make the spice 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.960
 hybrid training is to say where 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.790
 first the exercises are worked 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 basic in our soccer case 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.110
 different as is the bench press like 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.350
 is the squat as is the deadlift 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.180
 and then a series of exercises are done 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.369
 accessories even some to range of 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.799
 hypertrophy since as we have commented 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.830
 some other video to us we do not like 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.110
 and two we seem to win something from 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.560
 muscle out of season especially not 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.659
 it is never coming from more then that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.399
 I mean that at the time of the deficit 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.009
 caloric those exercises we have to 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.750
 let us go we can what we no longer 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.060
 we can do is this logical energy 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.830
 to lose weight to define the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.959
 men that we have more than one goal 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.239
 maintain or gain strength and over run 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.979
 normal muscles or hypertrophy this 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.780
 it is already impossible therefore the first 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.450
 is I mean with exercise in the state 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.390
 of strength is that we only touch the range 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.700
 of strength in the basic exercise that we 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.120
 double if we citizens what 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.299
 we make 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.640
 work 6 sets of four repetitions 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.379
 because everything that would be or six series at 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.989
 I focus failure whatever then to 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.269
 end up stuck in press the day that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.670
 we do banking there are three shoulders 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.860
 many times there is something of three with 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.420
 adventure dumbbells detect the day 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.060
 that they are dead in the dead prisoner 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.060
 illuminated test there are oars in the case 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.750
 of having caloric deficit and or 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.360
 exercises 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.459
 we would leave only we would 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.420
 from our point of view, 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.190
 Basic exercises in the range of strength 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.690
 and inside the weight squat 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.400
 dead with the strong exercise of 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.049
 work work be theologies other 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.609
 things only work bench is 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.799
 another thing but only the exercise of 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.810
 force because caloric deficit does not 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.730
 there will be much more apparent energy 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.069
 atrophy to gain strength and so on 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.989
 etcetera that's the first thing to focus on 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.730
 analytically the fires we have 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.769
 than doing the other thing we have to stop it 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.159
 side and then another very important thing 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.520
 cilantro the approximation exercises 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.320
 as the warm-up ones are light 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.900
 the celebrate for the class we will find 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.330
 the caloric deficit is the energy that 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.820
 we will have to train and that 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.920
 it will be low therefore warming 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.740
 effective and fast series of 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.900
 approach the jousts to get 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.690
 close well to the work series 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.440
 operated of force and then work the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.420
 force and then avoid the exercises 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.830
 accessory only the basic ones I in 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.960
 back for example and dead weight 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.030
 would put some oars that least 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.790
 I would jump because it's basic for meat 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.890
 the squat varies practically alone 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.870
 like a lot of genres because it's a 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.550
 muscle that the rag with the squat and 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.650
 chest day as much later 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.570
 would add a press is above the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.430
 head some I presented shoulders but already 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.200
 it would leave everything the dumbbells are 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.980
 the adventures of hypertrophy work 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.370
 I would leave it to the bank 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.530
 to ranges of strength and would leave on legs 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.030
 of squats forgiveness would leave what is 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.120
 the press what strides are 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.800
 and in the deadlift would then leave what 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.320
 are all pulls with chin-ups 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.630
 because you will not give for so much so 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.610
 so much to the question to which we referred 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.310
 by exercises in haiti with strength is 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.820
 that leave the accessories leave the topic 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.460
 of self-interest ranges between 6 and 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.740
 12 only work force and 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.350
 approximation exercises and 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.570
 warming light and just enough to 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.370
 be able to work without risk of injury 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.889
 So, since we take the objectives 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.210
 you have to select according 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.400
 this is the doubt we hope that we have 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.000
 resolved and from the others the videos 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.000
 thank you
