00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
staying within Amazon's own ecosystem
for<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.619> also<00:01:49.740> connect<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.310> with

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
for that you can also connect it up with

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
for that you can also connect it up with
local<00:01:50.729> radio<00:01:51.000> stations<00:01:51.509> through<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> tune<00:01:52.259> in

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
a service or iHeartRadio as well so it

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
a service or iHeartRadio as well so it
does<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:55.619> nice<00:01:55.860> stuff<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
does some pretty nice stuff there but it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
does some pretty nice stuff there but it
always<00:01:57.210> wants<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> default<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.890> Amazon's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.459 
always wants to default over to Amazon's
stuff<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.509> obviously<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.380> an

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
stuff so obviously because it's an

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.990 
stuff so obviously because it's an
Amazon<00:02:01.829> device<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> ask<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.969> question

manually up here with this little knob
you<00:03:23.810> can<00:03:23.930> also<00:03:24.080> ask<00:03:24.410> her<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.890> turn<00:03:25.070> this

you can also ask her to turn this

button here if you want to mute it what

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.670 
button here if you want to mute it what
it<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.090> doing<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.720> when<00:03:29.959> it's<00:03:30.080> plugged<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.500> and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
it is doing is when it's plugged in and

it is doing is when it's plugged in and
on<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:31.070> is<00:03:31.190> always<00:03:31.610> listening<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.390> don't

on it is always listening I don't

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.360 
on it is always listening I don't
believe<00:03:33.050> it's<00:03:33.230> sending<00:03:33.470> anything<00:03:33.830> out<00:03:34.070> over

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
believe it's sending anything out over

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.370 
believe it's sending anything out over
the<00:03:34.489> network<00:03:34.700> until<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.570> hears<00:03:35.840> its<00:03:36.019> command

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
the network until it hears its command

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.500 
the network until it hears its command
and<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.590> give<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.160> command<00:03:37.610> but<00:03:38.300> if<00:03:38.390> you're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
and you give it a command but if you're

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.729 
and you give it a command but if you're
not<00:03:38.600> comfortable<00:03:38.870> with<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.530> can<00:03:39.650> either

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
not comfortable with that you can either

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.949 
not comfortable with that you can either
unplug<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.430> or<00:03:40.940> hit<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.300> mute<00:03:41.450> button<00:03:41.480> up<00:03:41.810> here

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
unplug it or hit the mute button up here

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.600 
unplug it or hit the mute button up here
and<00:03:42.080> presumably<00:03:42.470> it'll<00:03:42.739> stop<00:03:42.980> listening<00:03:43.459> as

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
and presumably it'll stop listening as

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.460 
and presumably it'll stop listening as
long<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.360> button<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.170> there's

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
long as that button is on and there's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.960

also a power button here and that's

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.800 
also a power button here and that's
pretty<00:03:47.120> much<00:03:47.300> it

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810

on your day core and why do now is go

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.670 
on your day core and why do now is go
and<00:04:02.180> take<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.360> look<00:04:02.600> at<00:04:02.780> its<00:04:02.959> app<00:04:03.140> because<00:04:03.530> this

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
and take a look at its app because this

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.710 
and take a look at its app because this
is<00:04:03.800> what<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.550> links<00:04:04.880> up<00:04:05.030> with<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:05.420> when<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.600> do

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
is what it links up with so when you do

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.120 
is what it links up with so when you do
things<00:04:05.959> like<00:04:06.080> create<00:04:06.260> shopping<00:04:06.800> lists<00:04:07.040> or

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
things like create shopping lists or

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.250 
things like create shopping lists or
to-do<00:04:07.400> lists<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.269> app<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.690> where<00:04:08.870> all<00:04:09.080> of<00:04:09.230> that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
to-do lists the app is where all of that

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.930 
to-do lists the app is where all of that
data<00:04:09.650> will<00:04:09.890> go<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:10.280> let's<00:04:10.430> check<00:04:10.610> that<00:04:10.730> out

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
data will go so let's check that out

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.400 
data will go so let's check that out
so<00:04:11.150> when<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.299> first<00:04:11.450> boot<00:04:11.660> up<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.959> app<00:04:12.140> you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
so when you first boot up the app you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.050 
so when you first boot up the app you
get<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.620> list<00:04:12.830> of<00:04:12.980> everything<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.760> device

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
get a list of everything that the device

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.670 
get a list of everything that the device
was<00:04:14.299> asked<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.900> basically<00:04:15.140> keeps<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.500> running

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
was asked it basically keeps a running

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.039 
was asked it basically keeps a running
log<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.310> everything<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.060> four<00:04:17.540> times<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:17.959> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
log of everything and four times that it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.570 
log of everything and four times that it
can't<00:04:18.260> answer<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.620> question<00:04:19.100> which<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.370> quite

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
can't answer a question which is quite

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.760 
can't answer a question which is quite
often<00:04:19.790> what<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.630> does<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.080> basically<00:04:21.169> grabs

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
often what it does is it basically grabs

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.620 
often what it does is it basically grabs
whatever<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.250> asked<00:04:22.640> it<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:22.910> then<00:04:23.210> makes<00:04:23.479> it

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
whatever you asked it and then makes it

pretty neat again pretty basic kind of
stuff<00:04:44.390> what<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:44.900> do<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.230> about<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.740> it

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
stuff what I do like about it is that it

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.830 
stuff what I do like about it is that it
has<00:04:46.070> these<00:04:46.280> to-do<00:04:46.670> lists<00:04:46.970> on<00:04:47.090> here<00:04:47.300> as<00:04:47.420> well<00:04:47.630> so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
has these to-do lists on here as well so

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.920 
has these to-do lists on here as well so
I<00:04:47.870> could<00:04:48.080> say<00:04:48.290> Alexa<00:04:49.600> remind<00:04:50.600> me<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.780> get<00:04:50.870> some

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
I could say Alexa remind me to get some

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.460 
I could say Alexa remind me to get some
dog<00:04:51.320> food<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.150> goes<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.540> really<00:04:56.900> quickly

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
dog food and it goes in really quickly

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.900 
dog food and it goes in really quickly
so<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.770> just<00:04:57.920> basically<00:04:58.040> pops<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.670> right<00:04:58.760> in

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910

have as part of your workflow so you

have as part of your workflow so you
know<00:06:23.060> it's<00:06:23.210> fairly<00:06:23.330> limited<00:06:23.960> right<00:06:24.140> now<00:06:24.290> I

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
know it's fairly limited right now I

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.260 
know it's fairly limited right now I
think<00:06:24.500> it's<00:06:24.740> got<00:06:24.890> some<00:06:25.100> potential<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.940> audio

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
think it's got some potential the audio

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.940 
think it's got some potential the audio
technology<00:06:26.870> is<00:06:26.960> pretty<00:06:27.170> decent<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.710> voice

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
technology is pretty decent the voice

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.160 
technology is pretty decent the voice
sounds<00:06:28.430> really<00:06:28.460> natural<00:06:29.330> and<00:06:29.480> that's<00:06:29.960> pretty

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
sounds really natural and that's pretty

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.410 
sounds really natural and that's pretty
cool<00:06:30.470> but<00:06:30.710> I<00:06:30.920> am<00:06:31.040> really<00:06:31.520> struggling<00:06:32.000> to<00:06:32.060> find

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
cool but I am really struggling to find

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.940 
cool but I am really struggling to find
a<00:06:32.630> use<00:06:32.900> for<00:06:33.080> this<00:06:33.200> in<00:06:33.380> my<00:06:33.470> house<00:06:33.680> especially

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
a use for this in my house especially

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.520 
a use for this in my house especially
one<00:06:34.430> that<00:06:34.640> warrants<00:06:35.450> me<00:06:35.570> having<00:06:36.260> this<00:06:36.350> thing

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
one that warrants me having this thing

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.900 
one that warrants me having this thing
listening<00:06:37.040> to<00:06:37.130> everything<00:06:37.340> that's<00:06:37.520> going<00:06:37.790> on

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
listening to everything that's going on

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.850 
listening to everything that's going on
in<00:06:38.180> my<00:06:38.210> home<00:06:38.570> all<00:06:38.810> the<00:06:39.110> time<00:06:39.140> which<00:06:39.560> kind<00:06:39.800> of

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
in my home all the time which kind of

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.230 
in my home all the time which kind of
creeps<00:06:40.070> me<00:06:40.160> out<00:06:40.280> so

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
creeps me out so

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.879 
creeps me out so
I<00:06:41.270> would<00:06:41.539> probably<00:06:41.690> pass<00:06:42.080> on<00:06:42.349> this<00:06:42.500> until<00:06:42.830> I

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
I would probably pass on this until I

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.219 
I would probably pass on this until I
see<00:06:43.160> a<00:06:43.190> real<00:06:43.490> killer<00:06:44.090> application<00:06:44.960> for<00:06:45.199> a

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
see a real killer application for a

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.350 
see a real killer application for a
device<00:06:45.590> like<00:06:45.860> this<00:06:46.069> but<00:06:46.310> for<00:06:46.430> now<00:06:46.490> I<00:06:46.819> think<00:06:47.000> my

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
device like this but for now I think my

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.080 
device like this but for now I think my
phone<00:06:47.660> does<00:06:48.410> most<00:06:48.710> of<00:06:48.919> what<00:06:49.190> this<00:06:49.819> already

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
phone does most of what this already

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.790 
phone does most of what this already
does<00:06:50.419> and<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.900> think<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:51.259> phone<00:06:51.440> does<00:06:51.650> it

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
does and I think the phone does it

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.320 
does and I think the phone does it
better<00:06:51.979> this<00:06:52.220> is<00:06:52.280> Lyon<00:06:52.550> Simon<00:06:52.970> thanks<00:06:53.210> for
