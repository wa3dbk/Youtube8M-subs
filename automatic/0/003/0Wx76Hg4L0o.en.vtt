 hello guys and girls and the tutorial that 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.320
 you saw is learning to install a background 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.360
 with a letter of the norm is not that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.070
 we have to download in the page that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.939
 I recommend them is www.sun.com class test 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.369
 scratch and there you will find fed up 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.000
 fans to be able to install the ones that you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.000
 like 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:37.230
 I'm going to download it and I have you here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.230
 they unloaded two nights we left it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.219
 Y 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.649
 and to these ras 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.420
 well it's not in folder then the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.550
 we extract one we move towards the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 desk if I like them very well 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.879
 then put a surplus right button 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.879
 here 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.400
 we jump these things 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.400
 and we open one of these two any 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.420
 or open the two as they give install 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:21.330
 and nothing else so it was to do this 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.330
 and with this tone 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:34.820
 if they want they go to point is that and they see it 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:38.270
 if it works as it's called bratsch 7 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.270

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 ryan and rush hd a good 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.730
 and we say any photo to choose a d 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.070
 we look for the letter 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.009
 and there are here and then regulate them if 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.640
 they have the progress 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.310
