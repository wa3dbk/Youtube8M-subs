00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.610
 hello everyone so given 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.380
 that I realized that one 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.480
 helmet support it was really very 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.090
 especially useful for helmets with a 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.580
 microphone that stands out like the siberia v2 or 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.590
 the raft crack years like mine and 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.479
 why not make a support on 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340
 more aesthetic possible and so we 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.060
 let's see I'll show you how 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.760
 I made mine for this 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.740
 realization you will need a 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.610
 bit of wood a little long like that the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.100
 a pretty decent thickness good I 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.650
 take something in the plywood 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.160
 finally an agglomerate of about one 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.040
 centimeter bulls is a piece of wood 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.369
 like this like this is a bit thick that 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.770
 will act as two support feet of the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.410
 blow because it will be the built in some 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.190
 so it must be a little bit 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.840
 water and you will also need a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.149
 of a board then the finest 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.220
 possible but after that you do it 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.869
 that you want because I give you 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.140
 just the shape but you can very 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.450
 well improvised according to your desires 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.220
 personally this game makes these choices there 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.350
 there we will begin the route and the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 cutting you take your piece of 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.200
 wood and you trace a shape of little 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.569
 near the size that wanted 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 personally I want to remove the 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:28.840
 part that digs here from the charles coup 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.760
 zerah something like 10 cm by 16 cm 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.189
 here you drew your 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.370
 very pretty rectangle well we're going to 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:42.280
 cut 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.280
 [Music] 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.320
 now you take your other 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.970
 piece of wood so then you can 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.030
 take what you want no matter 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.750
 if the usc it is necessary that this width here 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.220
 to a little higher than those to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.400
 the thickness of the hoop of your helmet 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.400
 and we're going to cut it pretty much here I've 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.190
 measured pifometric mans for for the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.880
 helmet height in fact the cost is at 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.610
 about that what for me gives me 20 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.870
 cm exactly 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.930
 definitely I'm still in the cm 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.150
 pile hair so have you there too we're going to 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.930
 cut out and we go the assemblies then 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.120
 here I cut but four pieces 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.150
 we 're going to be a little bit 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.770
 because there really will have to do them 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.320
 a little bit of sanding because that's 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.110
 pretty ugly and eventually round 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.000
 a little the edges to give a species 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:48.569
 was not a style 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.569
 [Music] 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.019
 now with a tig there a little 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.610
 hammer of dante isoz depressed a small 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.340
 drawbridge hope to bring in more 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.340
 easily and started to drop 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.360
 so for the base I'll see me 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.530
 because she needs a little more 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.350
 resistance with regard to small 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.449
 little border there on the sides it did not 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.680
 no need for people bouvier resistance
