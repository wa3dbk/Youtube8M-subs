00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
that lenses can be used to focus

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.170

of<00:00:18.210> laser<00:00:18.600> light<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.230> point<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.650> even<00:00:19.800> smaller

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of laser light the point is even smaller

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.460 
of laser light the point is even smaller
but<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> limit<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> point<00:00:21.900> sides<00:00:22.260> is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
but the limit on the point sides is

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.040
