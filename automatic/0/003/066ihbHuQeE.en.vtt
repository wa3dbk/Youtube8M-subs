example uber port or an NFC tag you

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.610 
example uber port or an NFC tag you
might<00:00:58.700> be<00:00:58.910> thinking<00:00:59.360> that<00:00:59.390> NFC<00:00:59.870> works<00:01:00.290> by

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
might be thinking that NFC works by

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.260 
might be thinking that NFC works by
sending<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.250> receiving<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.790> radio<00:01:02.030> signal

like<00:01:02.989> booboo<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.530> five<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.969> are<00:01:05.119> right

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
like booboo the five and you are right

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.719 
like booboo the five and you are right
at<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.750> but<00:01:06.140> how<00:01:06.409> exactly<00:01:06.590> does<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.130> work<00:01:07.280> and

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
at that but how exactly does it work and

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:08.320 
at that but how exactly does it work and
what

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
what

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.430 
what
-<00:01:08.540> rotting<00:01:08.960> behind<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.470> let's<00:01:10.190> find<00:01:10.520> out<00:01:11.440> the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
- rotting behind it let's find out the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.040 
- rotting behind it let's find out the
basic<00:01:12.770> principle<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.490> how<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.000> fever<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:14.810> based

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
basic principle on how a fever is based

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.080 
basic principle on how a fever is based
upon<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.350> set<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.620> enough<00:01:15.920> indicate<00:01:16.610> foul<00:01:16.760> play

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.970 

now<00:01:20.090> -<00:01:20.420> what<00:01:20.960> if<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.230> is<00:01:21.380> nothing<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:21.860> not

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
now - what if that is nothing is not

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.650 
now - what if that is nothing is not
very<00:01:22.220> probably<00:01:22.700> she<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:22.940> speaking<00:01:23.150> through

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.570 

all<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.930> LCD<00:01:30.410> smartphones<00:01:30.980> and<00:01:31.190> especially

your smartphone it has a special

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.570 
your smartphone it has a special
activity<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.120> it<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:42.100> hardware<00:01:43.100> has<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> coil

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
activity to it the hardware has a coil

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.460 
activity to it the hardware has a coil
of<00:01:43.670> wire<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.210> then<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.960> electricity<00:01:45.410> is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
of wire and then the electricity is

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.290 
of wire and then the electricity is
passed<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:45.770> acquire<00:01:46.130> by<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.610> magnetic<00:01:46.850> field<00:01:47.030> is

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
passed to acquire by a magnetic field is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300 
passed to acquire by a magnetic field is
generated<00:01:47.390> around<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:48.860> zoom<00:01:49.130> into

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
generated around it so if we zoom into

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.310 
generated around it so if we zoom into
this<00:01:49.550> portion<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.630> look<00:01:50.930> something<00:01:51.140> like

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
this portion it will look something like

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.090 
this portion it will look something like
this<00:01:52.330> these<00:01:53.330> are<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.570> point<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.900> fire<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.410> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
this these are the point of fire in the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.550 
this these are the point of fire in the
hardware<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.790> will<00:01:56.450> be<00:01:56.570> showing<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> into

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
hardware I will be showing it to it into

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.730 
hardware I will be showing it to it into
practical<00:01:57.950> demonstration<00:01:58.580> after<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.030> so

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
practical demonstration after this so

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.230 
practical demonstration after this so
this<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.860> not<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.040> coil<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.400> wire<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.850> never<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
this is not a coil of wire and never the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.910 
this is not a coil of wire and never the
electricity<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.780> possible<00:02:03.170> disqualify<00:02:03.710> a

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
electricity is possible disqualify a

electricity is possible disqualify a
magnetic<00:02:04.280> field<00:02:04.430> will<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:04.700> generated<00:02:05.240> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
magnetic field will be generated and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:16.460 
magnetic field will be generated and
let's<00:02:06.080> assume<00:02:06.260> that<00:02:06.590> these

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.940 

okay<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.820> now<00:02:18.360> whenever<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.780> secondary<00:02:19.200> coil<00:02:19.590> in

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
okay so now whenever a secondary coil in

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.190 
okay so now whenever a secondary coil in
this<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> taxi<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.660> place<00:02:21.900> inside

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
this it is a taxi that is place inside

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.010 
this it is a taxi that is place inside
this<00:02:22.350> magnetic<00:02:22.620> field<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:24.300> duplicity<00:02:24.630> will

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
this magnetic field the duplicity will

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.960 
this magnetic field the duplicity will
be<00:02:25.140> abused<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.680> fact<00:02:25.920> second<00:02:26.400> wait<00:02:26.520> what

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
be abused in fact second wait what

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.630 
be abused in fact second wait what
so<00:02:27.240> let's<00:02:27.720> assume<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.590> our<00:02:28.770> Alexi

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
so let's assume that this is our Alexi

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.510 
so let's assume that this is our Alexi
time

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.700 

and<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:37.300> energy<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.990> placed<00:02:38.350> inside

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
and this energy that is placed inside

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.690 
and this energy that is placed inside
the<00:02:39.040> magnetic<00:02:39.940> field<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.500> smartphone<00:02:41.700> so

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
the magnetic field of the smartphone so

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.340 
the magnetic field of the smartphone so
what<00:02:42.880> will<00:02:43.030> happen<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.750> will<00:02:43.870> reduce

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
what will happen is it will reduce

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.870 
what will happen is it will reduce
electricity<00:02:45.100> due<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.490> magnetic<00:02:45.850> field

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
electricity due to the magnetic field

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.000 
electricity due to the magnetic field
and<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.810> will<00:02:47.020> start<00:02:47.380> transmitting<00:02:47.800> the

and it will start transmitting the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.180 
and it will start transmitting the
attention<00:02:48.400> which<00:02:48.520> has<00:02:48.700> stood<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:53.190> this

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
attention which has stood in it and this

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.710 
attention which has stood in it and this
is<00:02:54.370> where<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.760> energy<00:02:54.970> tax<00:02:55.300> our<00:02:55.720> so-called

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
is where the energy tax our so-called

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
is where the energy tax our so-called

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.030 

it's<00:03:09.120> called<00:03:09.510> passive<00:03:09.990> because<00:03:10.440> you've<00:03:10.740> seen

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it's called passive because you've seen

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.070 
it's called passive because you've seen
in<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> previous<00:03:11.550> example<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.300> Alexa<00:03:12.870> decks

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
in the previous example that Alexa decks

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.990 
in the previous example that Alexa decks
don't<00:03:13.350> have<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> power<00:03:13.860> supply<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.730> moon

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
don't have the power supply of the moon

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.970 
don't have the power supply of the moon
but<00:03:15.600> they<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:16.070> energy<00:03:18.470> from<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.710> nearby

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
but they have energy from the nearby

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.030 
but they have energy from the nearby
object<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:23.190> RFID<00:03:23.790> tags<00:03:24.150> because<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.350> NFC

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.640 
object and the RFID tags because and NFC
taxes<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> subcategory<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.480> RFID<00:03:28.050> tags<00:03:28.380> so

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
taxes the subcategory of RFID tags so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.580 
taxes the subcategory of RFID tags so
this<00:03:28.800> these<00:03:29.070> are<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.460> RFID<00:03:29.910> tags<00:03:30.210> a<00:03:30.590> subset

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
this these are the RFID tags a subset

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.840 
this these are the RFID tags a subset
will<00:03:31.800> be<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.430> second<00:03:32.880> Etsy<00:03:33.210> tax<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.640> next

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
will be in a second Etsy tax so the next

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.030 
will be in a second Etsy tax so the next
best<00:03:36.270> example<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> firefighting<00:03:37.380> actually

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
best example the firefighting actually

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.330 
best example the firefighting actually
one<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:40.230> tracking<00:03:40.560> animals<00:03:40.980> or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.220 
for tracking the shipments and energy
takes<00:03:44.490> a<00:03:44.640> little<00:03:44.790> bit<00:03:45.120> different<00:03:45.480> because<00:03:45.630> NFC

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
takes a little bit different because NFC

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.350 
takes a little bit different because NFC

induced inside this NFC tag and let me

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.390 
induced inside this NFC tag and let me
just<00:04:40.270> place<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:44.590> should<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:45.010> have

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
just place it and it should I have

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.340 
just place it and it should I have
programs<00:04:45.880> use<00:04:46.030> NFC<00:04:46.330> tags<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.750> blue<00:04:46.930> pair<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.290> a

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
programs use NFC tags to blue pair to a

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.550 
programs use NFC tags to blue pair to a
blue<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.250> will<00:04:48.430> say<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.810> if<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.990> tag<00:04:50.200> if<00:04:50.410> I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
blue so it will say this if I tag if I

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.020 
blue so it will say this if I tag if I
