the whole process in order to make a
video<00:00:33.030> game<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.989> multi<00:00:34.620> tiered<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.250> we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
video game is very multi tiered so we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.389 
video game is very multi tiered so we
have<00:00:35.520> motion<00:00:35.850> capture<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> cinematics

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
have motion capture we have a cinematics

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860 
have motion capture we have a cinematics
department<00:00:38.820> now<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.149> takes<00:00:39.540> care<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:39.840> of

a photo real walk cycle human it would
take<00:01:06.060> hours<00:01:06.810> most<00:01:07.409> likely<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:07.979> days<00:01:08.310> but

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
take hours most likely to take days but

take hours most likely to take days but
if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> game<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> has

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
if you want to do a game that has

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.980 
if you want to do a game that has
hundreds<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> thousands<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> those<00:01:12.659> motions

hundreds of thousands of those motions

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.440 
hundreds of thousands of those motions
the<00:01:13.860> best<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.270> some

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the best way to do it is to get some

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
the best way to do it is to get some
money<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> suit<00:01:15.990> motion<00:01:16.530> capture<00:01:16.680> because

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
money in a suit motion capture because

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.090 
money in a suit motion capture because
we<00:01:18.150> could<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.689> same<00:01:18.990> walk<00:01:19.320> cycle<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we could take that same walk cycle and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.800 
we could take that same walk cycle and
we<00:01:20.189> could<00:01:20.340> turn<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.640> around<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:22.320> few<00:01:22.860> hours

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
we could turn that around in a few hours

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
we could turn that around in a few hours
the<00:01:24.810> markers<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> foam<00:01:26.400> marker<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the markers it's a foam marker with a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
the markers it's a foam marker with a
Velcro<00:01:27.930> base<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.890> covered<00:01:29.430> in

Velcro base and it's covered in
Scotchgard<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.500> basically<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
Scotchgard which is basically a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.920 
Scotchgard which is basically a
reflective<00:01:32.670> tape<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> shine<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
reflective tape when you shine a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.109 
reflective tape when you shine a
flashlight<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.650> them<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:35.280> give<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
flashlight on them they give you this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
flashlight on them they give you this
just<00:01:36.360> white-hot<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.560> inch<00:01:37.799> ball<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.790> light<00:01:39.829> we

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
just white-hot one inch ball of light we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.440 
just white-hot one inch ball of light we
have<00:01:40.979> 28<00:01:41.400> cameras<00:01:42.590> they're<00:01:43.590> emitting<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.270> red

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
have 28 cameras they're emitting the red

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
have 28 cameras they're emitting the red
spectrum<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> light<00:01:46.049> infrared<00:01:46.409> there's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
spectrum of light infrared there's

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
spectrum of light infrared there's
actually<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.549> black<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.000> white<00:01:48.240> camera

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
actually a little black and white camera

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.380 
actually a little black and white camera
right<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> middle

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
right in the middle

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.930 
right in the middle
it<00:01:50.200> starts<00:01:50.710> out<00:01:50.830> on<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.979> piece<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.490> paper<00:01:51.610> when

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
it starts out on a piece of paper when

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.550 
it starts out on a piece of paper when
you<00:01:52.000> say<00:01:52.120> okay<00:01:52.330> we<00:01:52.450> want<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:52.840> character<00:01:53.080> to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
you say okay we want this character to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.250 
you say okay we want this character to
do<00:01:54.220> this<00:01:54.400> in<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.670> scene<00:01:54.880> basically<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:56.170> know

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
do this in the scene basically you know

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.230 
do this in the scene basically you know
we'll<00:01:56.590> look<00:01:57.010> at<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.280> on<00:01:57.400> paper<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.760> then

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
we'll look at it on paper and then

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.480 
we'll look at it on paper and then
decide<00:01:58.780> how<00:01:58.810> much<00:01:59.140> we<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.530> capture<00:01:59.740> if<00:02:00.280> we<00:02:00.400> can

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
decide how much we can capture if we can

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.260 
decide how much we can capture if we can
capture<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.880> safely<00:02:02.760> almost-kiss<00:02:03.760> emission

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
capture it safely almost-kiss emission

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.340 
capture it safely almost-kiss emission
capture<00:02:04.570> has<00:02:04.750> two<00:02:05.260> different<00:02:05.410> uses<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:08.140> is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
capture has two different uses one is

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.220 
capture has two different uses one is
for<00:02:08.979> cinematics<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.660> can<00:02:10.810> use<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.080> as<00:02:11.200> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
for cinematics you can use it as a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.640 
for cinematics you can use it as a

without any audio on it we're looking at
something<00:03:01.490> like<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.390> where<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:02.780> see<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> movie

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
something like this where we see a movie

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.160 
something like this where we see a movie
and<00:03:04.130> we<00:03:04.760> see<00:03:04.910> characters<00:03:05.360> moving<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.020> doing

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
and we see characters moving and doing

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.350 
and we see characters moving and doing
things<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.700> character<00:03:08.120> walking

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
things in here the character walking

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.970 
things in here the character walking
around<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.080> world<00:03:09.200> actually<00:03:09.739> should<00:03:09.950> have

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
around in the world actually should have

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.080 
around in the world actually should have
some<00:03:10.250> footsteps<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:15.140> sound<00:03:15.410> effects<00:03:16.090> voices

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
some footsteps and sound effects voices

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.820 
some footsteps and sound effects voices
and<00:03:17.239> characters<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:20.110> finally<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.560> give<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.800> a

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
and characters and finally to give it a

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.170 
and characters and finally to give it a
little<00:03:21.950> mood<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.370> atmosphere<00:03:22.519> we<00:03:23.000> need<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
little mood and atmosphere we need a

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.900 
little mood and atmosphere we need a
music<00:03:23.540> track<00:03:23.690> behind<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:29.350> think<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.470> most

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
music track behind it I think the most

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.490 
music track behind it I think the most
awesome<00:03:31.910> feeling<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.570> when<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.080> create

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
awesome feeling is when you create

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.830 
awesome feeling is when you create
something<00:03:33.830> new<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.880> really<00:03:35.209> didn't<00:03:35.510> exist

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
something new that really didn't exist

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.370 
something new that really didn't exist
before

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
before

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.080 
before
whatever<00:03:36.830> we're<00:03:37.040> dreaming<00:03:37.340> whatever<00:03:37.820> we're

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
whatever we're dreaming whatever we're

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.509 
whatever we're dreaming whatever we're
trying<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.480> envision<00:03:38.840> yeah<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:40.070> just<00:03:40.250> need<00:03:40.400> to

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
trying to envision yeah we just need to

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.850 
trying to envision yeah we just need to
find<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.510> objects<00:03:41.989> they're<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.350> assets<00:03:42.709> that

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
find the objects they're the assets that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.960 
find the objects they're the assets that
will<00:03:43.010> help<00:03:43.130> us<00:03:43.280> make<00:03:43.489> it

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
will help us make it

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.780 
will help us make it
we<00:03:44.780> take<00:03:45.019> scans<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:46.010> different<00:03:46.430> objects

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
we take scans of different objects

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.770 
we take scans of different objects
within<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.180> real<00:03:47.420> world<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.049> it<00:03:48.860> allows<00:03:49.220> our

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
within the real world and it allows our

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.380 
within the real world and it allows our
artists<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.079> have<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.470> build<00:03:52.190> less<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
artists to have to build less on the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.930 
artists to have to build less on the
computer<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.769> types<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.190> we<00:03:55.340> use<00:03:55.579> are

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
computer and the types that we use are

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.520 
computer and the types that we use are
either<00:03:56.150> structured<00:03:56.630> light<00:03:56.810> scanners<00:03:57.290> or

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
either structured light scanners or

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.600 
either structured light scanners or
laser<00:03:57.950> scanners<00:03:58.549> they<00:03:59.090> go<00:03:59.570> at<00:03:59.900> a<00:04:00.610> wavelength

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
laser scanners they go at a wavelength

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.000 
laser scanners they go at a wavelength
of<00:04:01.790> 390<00:04:02.450> nanometers<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.560> sends<00:04:03.829> out

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
of 390 nanometers and it sends out

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.520 
of 390 nanometers and it sends out
patterns<00:04:04.519> of<00:04:04.670> light<00:04:04.880> waves<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:06.350> laser

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
patterns of light waves and the laser

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.370 
patterns of light waves and the laser
light<00:04:06.769> goes<00:04:06.980> out<00:04:07.130> comes<00:04:07.730> back<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.750> is

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
light goes out comes back in and is

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.750 
light goes out comes back in and is
received<00:04:09.799> in<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:09.950> camera<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.430> then<00:04:10.549> there's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
received in the camera and then there's

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.979 
received in the camera and then there's
processing<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.660> goes<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:14.630> make<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
processing that goes on to make the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.199 
processing that goes on to make the
three-dimensional<00:04:15.709> scan<00:04:15.950> we<00:04:16.430> will<00:04:16.640> take<00:04:16.970> each

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
three-dimensional scan we will take each

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.509 
three-dimensional scan we will take each
separate<00:04:17.959> scan<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.890> using<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.310> software

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
separate scan and using the software

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.620 
separate scan and using the software
overlay<00:04:20.329> them<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.919> create<00:04:21.919> one<00:04:22.100> scan<00:04:22.600> we<00:04:23.600> can

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
overlay them and create one scan we can

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.800 
overlay them and create one scan we can
do<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> face<00:04:24.140> scan<00:04:24.470> in<00:04:24.740> ten<00:04:25.010> seconds<00:04:25.400> time<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:26.780> a

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
do a face scan in ten seconds time to a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.850 
do a face scan in ten seconds time to a
complete<00:04:27.470> scan<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:27.979> an<00:04:28.820> object<00:04:29.330> in<00:04:29.660> its<00:04:30.080> large

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
complete scan of an object in its large

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.670 
complete scan of an object in its large
say<00:04:31.300> automobile<00:04:32.300> would<00:04:33.050> take<00:04:33.229> about<00:04:33.440> two

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
say automobile would take about two

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.610 
say automobile would take about two
