bit it wasn't very good

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.260 
bit it wasn't very good
so<00:00:34.130> then<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.370> ended<00:00:34.580> up<00:00:34.700> quitting<00:00:34.880> in<00:00:35.150> high

everything's falling into place and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.109 
everything's falling into place and
everything<00:01:12.799> is<00:01:13.250> starting<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.850> look<00:01:14.060> really

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
