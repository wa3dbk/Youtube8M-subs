that the proposed to head plus a little

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.469 
that the proposed to head plus a little
bit<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.549> shave<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> wait<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> little

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
bit more they shave the wait a little

bit more they shave the wait a little
bit<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.080> also<00:01:19.259> edit<00:01:20.000> compressor<00:01:21.000> for

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
bit and they also edit compressor for

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
bit and they also edit compressor for
shock<00:01:21.689> absorption<00:01:21.770> everything<00:01:22.770> else<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
shock absorption everything else is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
shock absorption everything else is
still<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.460> foot<00:01:24.119> bill<00:01:24.390> exact<00:01:25.290> pro

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
still the same foot bill exact pro

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.690 
still the same foot bill exact pro
technology<00:01:26.280> fiber<00:01:27.030> kill<00:01:27.680> etc<00:01:28.680> etc<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.280> that's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
technology fiber kill etc etc all that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
technology fiber kill etc etc all that's
still<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> same<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> proposed<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.680> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
still the same in the proposed so it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.570 
still the same in the proposed so it's
like<00:01:33.110> upgrading<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.229> car

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580
