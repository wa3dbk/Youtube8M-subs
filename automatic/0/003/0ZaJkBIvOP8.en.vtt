00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.260
 hello how about very good friends from 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.560
 Point habitat is and I look and I have point is 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.770
 let's see this time a lamp 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.770
 ceiling 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.050
 in the form of a cylinder 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:48.670
 and its reference is 12.104 12.104 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.399
 has completely mounted 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.399
 and is to remove it from the box 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.400
 and let's see how good the cylinder 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.460
 the tulip was completely formed 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.590
 this bet comes for the lamp of the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.210
 Normal ass already from the fat ass 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.530
 and it's a maximum of 60 watts and then you 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.649
 you want to put it on if you're going to 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 put low consumption warm light the white ones 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.720
 whatever it was and it comes with a cable this 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 cable that is called transparent 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.710
 now we see it a bit stolen but with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.190
 the weight of the lamp then gets 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.909
 Straight straight and it gets harder to see 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.979
 it does not become more invisible 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.149
 the support that he has we will see 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.499
 let's make the first plans because 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.499
 the truth that he was quite handsome 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.670
 very well here I have removed it in a 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.920
 moment the desire the plastic this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.539
 protector so that you see the sense of 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.149
 the lamp not the pretty lamp 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.880
 Apart from being a perfect cylinder it is 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.990
 that have a thread for many centuries 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.439
 on the other a thread side by side 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.470
 then with the effect of light it is 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.899
 let light through the centuries 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.189
 and it's very very beautiful now we're going to 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.119
 see some close-ups we're going to 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:11.690
 put a lamp underneath a bit like that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.239
 a very simple plan but you will be able to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.910
 appreciate the meaning the effect it makes 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.410
 the lamp is worth what we told you before 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 of the hardware this one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.610
 how do you take this to the ceiling as this 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.390
 platen that is inside the box 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.170
 I was welcomed to the roof and then 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.780
 then the housing is made of metal 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.450
 so screw and screw 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.660
 here and since the ceiling fuck regulates 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.760
 the length of the cable to your liking can 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.520
 be almost almost completely stuck to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.420
 roof or if the ceiling is too high you can 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.440
 download to your taste notes that you have 80 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.459
 centimeters plus 25 of the lamp 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 you already have to do a meter for 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.450
 below I do not think you have the ceiling so 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.890
 high if there is no prayer in the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 head 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.760
 very often comes with the instructions 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.620
 that does not come to be instructions because 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.340
 it already comes mounted but a handrail 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.290
 and it comes with the two screws that are 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.690
 to take it to the ceiling plus its two 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.310
 screws these little ones that we said 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.380
 before 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.230
 they have caught the tulip 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.640
 let's make some close-ups and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.640
 let's hope that you like it and that it serves you 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.390
 ah 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.200
 i 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.370
