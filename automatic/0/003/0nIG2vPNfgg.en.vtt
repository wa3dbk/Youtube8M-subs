00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.199
 ships 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.590
 I like this one more because so because 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.030
 is legal but evil attack to bet 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.030
 battle that is here 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.200
 I do not know if it's going to be here. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.170
 It's ready to tighten fighting was to 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.440
 right here 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.440
 I'll have a little I know happened here. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:55.399

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.030
 Good folks, that's it, I came back here. 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.340
 continuing here this part was not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.670
 appearing I do not know why Vince 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.269
 game but okay so use here has 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.630
 four type a is regular and randon wii 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:25.290
 players and sole fight 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.299
 So let's catch the flight with this ship. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.340
 here is very good 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:35.910
 tension 4,469 players online 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.739
 now in this second we go 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.420
 see how long it takes to get through 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.000
 room is for a maximum of 20 seconds 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.910
 I do not know how to record and it also depends on 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.620
 46 more irregular than you think 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:01.260
 Faster on the okay. Okay. Ok. Ok. Let's go on the ark. 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.329
 that even playing is faster than 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 I do not know, it's faster to 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:18.090
 to find the room ready was the scheme of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.750
 game is very cool the game different a fps 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.170
 quite different from everyone I've come to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.930
 is rare ship right but that's it is that 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.540
 they all come in 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.000
 for 16 15 and 20 seconds 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.900
 I'm going with this ship here because I 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.900
 I like her very much 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.959
 If it's low, it's to choose nothing. 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.049
 of these things and set the second goes 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:49.019
 then start 4 3 2 1 0 started ready 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.239
 When it's really cool, it seems to me that 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:58.549
 People control nothing by the mouse where they pull 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.549
 also to accelerate so is shift and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.349
 came to dominate the base there with the button 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.269
 right and now it's work you do not 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:14.700
 You have to drop the bomb us and I'm 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:18.900
 Nobody comes there and I 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:28.560
 I'll try to destroy it in the village. 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:36.830
 This view here is really cool and filled 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.830
 there in the iron 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:05:18.550
 Forget it is if you come here head first. 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:05:25.330
 For merchandise it is good to take that 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.330
 caring and not 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.450
 lohan 's father is worth stop fell 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.880
 it's clear 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:54.340
 I think it's a shame that I died of 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.600
 we who narrates beautiful 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.600
 only they will not do well 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:10.360
 not that this was going to love me on this ship 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:16.810
 it is more difficult to control what is 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:19.930
 but afro of the sabatina the shot of this one here 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:23.160
 It seems that it's cooler. 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.160
 the bucket 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:39.779
 kite kite kite kite kite kite kite kite 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:39.779
 but I'll say he drops the bomb 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:48.360
 You only have a problem touching me too. 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.449
 ae 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:07:04.929

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:09.429

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:11.679
 just enough money is earned in the game 

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.809
 but I hope you have enjoyed yourself 

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:15.849
