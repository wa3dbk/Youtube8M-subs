00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello how about how are you welcome to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.440
 eating rich today we are going to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.719
 prepare a really simple recipe 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 to do and also very practical for 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.890
 when you want to cook country like you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 you know the countries require a mass 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 very special but at the same time 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.630
 recipe is very simple practice and easy 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 of doing these are the ingredients 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 The first thing we are going to do to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 prepare our pasta is to mix 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.309
 our health and our sugar in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 our flour for quantities 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.000
 Exactly from this recipe I'm going to 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.610
 recommend that you visit our page 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 web I entrust blake or dot net here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 below in the description of this video 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.760
 they will find the league that is going to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 take directly to the recipe of this 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 good video so first thing is the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.579
 salt the sugar the flour now I already 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.839
 cut my little pieces of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.049
 butter I'm going to add here 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.080
 directly to the mix is ​​recommended 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:04.049
 that this flour all this butter 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.759
 be completely cold put about 30 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.770
 minutes in the refrigerator before 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.720
 prepare it so that you can grab the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 consistency we are looking not 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 use butter at the time then 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.650
 We put our butter here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.460
 directly we are going to put our 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.090
 order in which you look how it looks 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.090
 we put it here and now ideally this 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.460
 This flour should be prepared in one 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.650
 of those dishes that are called processes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.330
 but I do not have one of them and a lot 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.920
 people do not have them either 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.050
 then I'm going to show you the way 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.060
 manual to be able to do this with a 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.060
 common fork and we are going to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.190
 start mixing wade or disrupt 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.710
 our flour inside our 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.140
 our butter sorry inside 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.960
 our flour so that it is mixed in one 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 uniform way not then we start to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.700
 derail in this way I hope that it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.920
 can see well this is a manual way 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.140
 and that's how we're doing it 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.170
 have patience if you take a little 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.119
 time that week of your close hands 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.979
 obviously, but that's the way cooking is 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.800
 the kitchen if it does not dirty our hands 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.540
 then it is not cooking a 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.330
 Once we have achieved this consistency 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.700
 it's time to put our cold water 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.800
 it is important to mention here friends who 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.590
 they must be very careful in that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.510
 all the lumps of the butter are 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.340
 mix very well now the other secret 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.940
 of this flour is that we are going to add 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.280
 Water 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.150
 frost that's the point of this we're going 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.349
 to see a little 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.349
 let's stir our mix 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.970
 to 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.970
 and we use our hands now 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.010
 the move and with my hands is going to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.690
 help a lot to also derail all 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.490
 those pieces of butter that you can not 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.520
 mix with the retainer makes a 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.770
 moments then I'm trying it 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.500
 perfectly well right now with your hand and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.870
 sanctioning me that the whole mix was 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.040
 perfectly well well made perfect 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.870
 once all my pasta is 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.790
 completely mixed what I'm going to 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.670
 to do is put it in a bag of 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.890
 plastic as well as this is made little ball 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.530
 perfect and I'm going to put it in the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.780
 refrigerator for not less than 30 minutes 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.240
 It would be ideal if they could do it one day 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.730
 but if you must not leave 30 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.800
 minutes minimum and essentially as 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.720
 about two hours to make it better 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.970
 the reason that we're putting it in 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.240
 the refrigerator is very simple is for 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.000
 that the glucose in the mass relax 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.010
 and so that the butter also or the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.840
 fat and butter harden in 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.090
 this peace well here friends have it 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.460
 this is the pasta to prepare it 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.930
 any kind of country is like them 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.069
 I said in the previous cut you have to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.739
 leave it not 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.689
 of 30 minutes I'm today was I left it by 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.879
 two days in the refrigerator and right now 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.249
 is completely ready to prepare 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.319
 the pay that I'm going to make is very important 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.299
 that keep it refrigerated not the 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.760
 put in the freezer but leave it in 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.099
 the refrigerator and it's good to make it from a 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.229
 day for another and so they will have better 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.049
