00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
reach so dry that point and then draw it

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.609 
reach so dry that point and then draw it
down<00:01:04.000> on<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.299> bottom<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.839> then<00:01:05.439> you're<00:01:05.590> just

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
down on the bottom and then you're just

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:06.960 
down on the bottom and then you're just
going<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.979> go<00:01:06.100> ahead<00:01:06.189> and<00:01:06.490> connect<00:01:06.790> those<00:01:06.939> two

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
going to go ahead and connect those two

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.880 
going to go ahead and connect those two
points<00:01:07.390> now<00:01:08.049> go<00:01:08.290> ahead<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.500> look<00:01:08.710> at<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
points now go ahead and look at the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.469 
points now go ahead and look at the
difference<00:01:08.920> between<00:01:09.369> when<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.939> open<00:01:10.299> and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
contracts when you open and close so

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.210 
contracts when you open and close so
close<00:01:19.600> your<00:01:20.350> eye<00:01:20.380> looks<00:01:20.680> completely
