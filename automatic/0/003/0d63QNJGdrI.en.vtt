00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.360
 to me 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.860
 they 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.760
 hello everyone today we will try 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.750
 learn this simple reef chick 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.240
 for beginner guitarists me here in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.670
 comments are often asked to make out 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.000
 something faster and harder 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.230
 And I think so who wants faster and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.530
 more difficult 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.770
 need notes and tablature my channel to them 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.050
 absolutely not needed they still don't 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.350
 teach my reefs 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.930
 they just look and put dizlik not 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.360
 I know what a thrill they get from it 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.740
 but I think the way it is so I still 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.840
 since I speak for those who do not understand yet 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:23.320
 looked what my channel what my channel 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.000
 beginners only and i help people 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.850
 get off the ground as they say 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.270
 who bought the guitar and doesnâ€™t know 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.390
 what can I do with it for those 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:44.119
 my channel and how this reef is played 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:55.959
 guitar friend smoke or dr option we clamp 8 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:59.030
 fret then 4 fret 6 fret and again 8 all and 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.869
 here we will have two more to participate 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.869
 fingertips 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.650
 on the fourth string they will do everything 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.500
 and 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.500
 and 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.129
 not 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.580
 men 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.510
 so this bra is played 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.390
 I thought of it myself if you play 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.030
 it was somehow not so easy to use 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.780
 these frets are not these same waltzes 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.220
 strings 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.540
 please play whatever you want 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.239
 if only it sounded in the meaning of these 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.599
 simple reefs so you learn at least 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.719
 somehow navigate the guitar where 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.079
 sounds where does not sound well catch this 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.189
 a chip that's for this reason I am doing dissections 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.609
 these simple 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:10.319
 reefs, well, just once we play it to 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.319
 it was a little clearer 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.440
 now normal pace 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.630
 and 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:58.430
 I think this elevator will work for many 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.430
 good luck to you all
