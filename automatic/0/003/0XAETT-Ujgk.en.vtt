00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.949
 In the last episodes Professor has us but the keeper is made clear what 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.629
 really hiding behind the word farming 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.179
 To award the most important points Professor has the clip is the 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.529
 Demand summarized for us 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.200
 and there goes a real estate agent 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.830
 and edited a certain group of people or test still takes place 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.829
 more often 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.249
 Percent Ryanair 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.160

 Percent of a residential complex particularly intense 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.250
 Project goal is there as a kind of specialist as in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.580
 Quotes tend to position 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.330
 The goal is to get into the situation that if there in this street in 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.980
 this block somebody does not think long and who could because of that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.090
 Selling real estate but the thought must be that this is usually done here 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.300
 so Bizzo successful 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.630
 and as far as a try here, a small farm Tormo Matt adds the field 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.880
 percent 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.270

 o-ton Thomas he eats then reaps 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.840
 the most important was defects immense is thus the more intensive customer care 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.190
 because facilitated by the recommendation of other customers is the work of a broker 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 immense and goes beyond the previously known level of service significantly 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.850
 The goal is a close customer loyalty that feels to recommendations and so the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.470
 Client of the broker multiplied 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.470
 the field is the housing estate in which works 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.230
 one returns certain techniques and methods 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.140
 Remains and adds advises 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 who and then holds in the hand and e as well there as well 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.870
 I do not have certain methods as a real estate company trying there foot 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.820
 to understand 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 Dellwig deal with the customers there 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.160
 and then finally little 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.650
 start the harvest 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.150
 in important point of playing 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.930
 Napoleon at the farm percent if you buy them too is first of all the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.670

 somewhere I drive where do I want to build my wife bassist 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.229
 Survey accident can make a lot of thought 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.840
 So it is not enough to sow the seed 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 The best way to do business is if the broker has several areas at the same time 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.489
 can manage 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.889
 for example, a harvest that has been hailed can be compensated elsewhere or 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.729
 even overcompensated 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.209
 ultimately, percent 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.780
 Experienced is the idea I have not only in one place a farm Voigt 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.780
 But I have wings in the best case, so I have 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.109
 to diversify the DED Anke 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.469

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.379
 Experience in different segments I work and try so little 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.339
 Percent to sprinkle snappy

 the overview 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.589
 when considering future economy, it's going to the right side 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.909
 Trends and transforms 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.709

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.249

 Markerto situations suddenly give up break 1 is certain 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.769
 Trendsetters pull away or report the old structure and suddenly there 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.680
 a lot of movement in the squad can be just for example in this example 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.450
 a home session then so construction sites can come to the situation that suddenly 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.809
