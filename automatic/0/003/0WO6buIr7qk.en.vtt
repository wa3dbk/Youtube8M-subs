00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.790 
does work great but myself being a DIY
type<00:01:18.790> of<00:01:18.940> person<00:01:19.360> decide<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.259> go<00:01:20.380> ahead<00:01:20.410> and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
type of person decide to go ahead and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.520 
type of person decide to go ahead and
make<00:01:20.920> my<00:01:21.100> own<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.690> said<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:22.930> use<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.320> RO

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
make my own like I said I use the RO

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.930 
make my own like I said I use the RO
water<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:24.280> use<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.000> funnel<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.720> also<00:01:26.229> a

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
water I use the funnel and also a

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.460 
water I use the funnel and also a
strainer<00:01:27.940> I<00:01:28.270> really<00:01:28.750> don't<00:01:28.930> recommend<00:01:29.050> the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
strainer I really don't recommend the

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.960 
strainer I really don't recommend the
use<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.890> strainer<00:01:30.160> because<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.610> just<00:01:30.729> kind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
use of a strainer because it just kind

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.109 
use of a strainer because it just kind
of<00:01:31.000> got<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.330> way<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.890> looking<00:01:32.890> closer<00:01:33.789> at

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
of got in the way and looking closer at

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.670 
of got in the way and looking closer at
the<00:01:34.240> strainer<00:01:34.509> really<00:01:35.020> doesn't<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.530> whole

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
the strainer really doesn't have a whole

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.010 
the strainer really doesn't have a whole
lot<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.009> residue<00:01:36.580> left<00:01:36.789> over

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
lot of residue left over

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.249 
lot of residue left over
I<00:01:38.080> used<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:39.360> jar<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.600> already<00:01:40.720> had<00:01:40.990> laying

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
I used a jar that I already had laying

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.950 
I used a jar that I already had laying
around<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.800> just<00:01:42.700> my<00:01:42.880> funnel<00:01:43.149> my<00:01:43.479> funnel<00:01:43.750> is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
around and just my funnel my funnel is

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.620 
around and just my funnel my funnel is
what<00:01:44.770> actually<00:01:44.920> used<00:01:45.250> from<00:01:45.460> my<00:01:46.149> kalkwasser

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
what actually used from my kalkwasser

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.620 
what actually used from my kalkwasser
when<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.050> do<00:01:47.170> put<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.619> in<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.430> container<00:01:48.789> not<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
when I do put it in the container not a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.690 
when I do put it in the container not a
big<00:01:49.840> deal<00:01:50.080> but<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:51.009> probably<00:01:51.250> don't<00:01:51.429> need<00:01:51.550> as

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
big deal but you probably don't need as

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.200 
big deal but you probably don't need as
much<00:01:51.850> garlic<00:01:52.300> as<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:53.100> went<00:01:54.100> ahead<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.490> used<00:01:54.640> but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210
