 fraill to me with another I hope that 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.400
 interesting almost creative and the theme of 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.920
 today is 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.599
 I also like Freud and many 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.939
 of you used to believe in the benefits 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.680
 to compete compete in a safe way 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.930
 to make you better and better in what 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 do and feel good about yourself 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.289
 he said but what else would he believe if 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.210
 Our wonderful system works 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 based on competition 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 we compete in school to win the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 best notes we compete in business 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 to earn more money than so-and-so 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 we compete at home to be the same or 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.739
 better than our parents compete with 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 what we see on television to be 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.940
 as or more cool that they compete and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 compete compete pitifully this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 system always has the same result 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.659
 loser winner and that's the way the world is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.850
 Some are doing well and others are doing poorly 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.640
 cooperate however muscle result 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 different winner winner if we act 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.799
 thinking of the good with automatically 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.290
 we are included and your neighbor is well 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 you are fine if your neighbor is wrong you 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.610
 you're wrong one day you sneak in a row and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590
 someone loses time another day someone 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.380
 sneaks in a row and you lose time 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 because we do not make our line and all 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.189
 we won a part of all of us had 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.050
 than learning to cooperate even before 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.890
 born as illustrated by the following 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.290
 written 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.360
 on twitter almost creative I offer rindo 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.830
 so that you leave your greetings and ideas a 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.970
 I hug my people very strong and here 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.970
 see you next 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.090
 in the academy they only taught us to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 do one thing swim and in one 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.860
 forward direction when I left I 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.180
 I realized that we were many more than 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.590
 what it looks like we're going from inside 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.420
 hundreds of millions 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 we had a long and hard road through 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.880
 in front of us quickly we started to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.400
 our 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.350
 we had to swim very hard and we did it 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.090
 very close together 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.520
 something told us that the current of 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.620
 next you helped a little and yours will 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.740
 it helped to go somehow we 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.270
 we were tired - stronger 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.160
 in front of the peloton and cut the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.180
 current so that those behind us 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.180
 it will cost less to move 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.709
 we encouraged each other 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.640
 but many were left by the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.640
 obstacles in the middle 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.210
 Y 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.740
 they exhausted their forces and gave their lives 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.920
 so that the group would reach that 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.920
 point 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 no longer we were running a lot and our 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.599
 forces were also almost exhausted 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.120
 when someone shouted there is and what 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.560
 we saw perfectly round and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.940
 bright waiting for us at the end of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.070
 tunnel 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.050
 the last forces served to 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.950
 reach him and encourage most 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.950
 strong that we could 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.490
 the great circle began to turn each time 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.550
 faster and faster 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.620
 and then the unexpected happened all 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.760
 my classmates looked at me and told me 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.280
 You yourself are this moment, come in, but 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.710
 If I'm just one more, you 're yourself 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.200
 they said do not worry about anything comes in 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.870
 since we are here 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.599
 and thanks to the effort of all I achieved 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.590
 to merge with the great circle in 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.590
 just one I know
