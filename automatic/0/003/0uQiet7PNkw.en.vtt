very neat looking area in fact this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.229 
very neat looking area in fact this
would<00:00:39.629> probably<00:00:40.100> match<00:00:41.100> very<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.820> well<00:00:42.059> with

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
would probably match very very well with

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
would probably match very very well with
the<00:00:42.390> constellation<00:00:42.989> Phoenix<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.559> anybody<00:00:43.920> had

the constellation Phoenix if anybody had
that<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.789> looks<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.390> interior<00:00:45.809> design

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520

quite<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:48.960> work<00:00:49.140> quite<00:00:49.410> well

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
quite well and it will work quite well

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880 
quite well and it will work quite well
with<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> we're<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.840> gonna<00:00:52.050> walk<00:00:52.739> around

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
with it so we're just gonna walk around

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
very nice design to it I'm guessing that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.179 
very nice design to it I'm guessing that
the<00:01:33.630> right<00:01:34.020> portion<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> left<00:01:34.950> portion

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the right portion and the left portion

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.120 
the right portion and the left portion
move<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> side<00:01:36.060> whereas<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
move off to the side whereas the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
move off to the side whereas the
triangle<00:01:38.130> probably<00:01:38.579> moves<00:01:38.759> down<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
triangle probably moves down which is a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
triangle probably moves down which is a
very<00:01:40.049> very<00:01:40.259> interesting<00:01:40.560> design<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.610> have
