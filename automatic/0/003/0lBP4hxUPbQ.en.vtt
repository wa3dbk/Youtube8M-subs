have the LTE logo this is a 4G LTE
device<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:08.179> not<00:02:08.270> here<00:02:08.479> for<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> USA<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.470> is

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
device but not here for the USA this is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.309 
device but not here for the USA this is
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.890> support<00:02:10.009> LTE<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.910> Europe<00:02:11.240> also<00:02:11.870> you

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
going to support LTE in Europe also you

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.949 
going to support LTE in Europe also you
can<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.680> here<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.010> had<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> WCDMA<00:02:13.850> 850<00:02:14.780> in

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
can see here we had the WCDMA 850 in

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.760 
can see here we had the WCDMA 850 in
2100<00:02:15.740> for<00:02:15.980> AT&amp;T<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> does<00:02:17.180> support<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
2100 for AT&amp;T and it does support the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.110 
2100 for AT&amp;T and it does support the
1940<00:02:18.770> mobile<00:02:19.040> as<00:02:19.160> well<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.610> we're<00:02:19.760> gonna<00:02:19.880> get

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
1940 mobile as well so we're gonna get

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.920 
1940 mobile as well so we're gonna get
3G<00:02:20.870> network<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.880> AT&amp;T<00:02:22.880> Mobile<00:02:23.510> here<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.840> the

USA it is a quad-core processor clock

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.360 
USA it is a quad-core processor clock
when<00:02:26.959> three<00:02:27.140> gigahertz<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.830> does<00:02:27.980> have<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
when three gigahertz it does have a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.350

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
screen on viewing angles gonna have

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.590 
screen on viewing angles gonna have
great<00:02:34.250> colors<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.880> here<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.209> can<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
great colors and here we can see the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.840 
great colors and here we can see the
camera<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.080> 5<00:02:36.290> megapixel<00:02:36.530> camera<00:02:36.890> with<00:02:37.250> a

galaxy was going to be the recorded

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.229 
galaxy was going to be the recorded
quality<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.370> also<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.850> see<00:02:43.970> here<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
quality and also we can see here the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.479 
quality and also we can see here the
connectivity<00:02:44.950> information<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> other

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
functions supported on this device so

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.750 
functions supported on this device so
now<00:02:48.920> we're<00:02:49.130> going<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> go<00:02:49.400> ahead<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.640> check

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
now we're going to go ahead and check

is gonna be twenty seven hundred

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.570 
is gonna be twenty seven hundred
milliamps<00:05:01.290> as<00:05:01.590> we<00:05:01.740> can<00:05:01.860> see<00:05:02.010> right<00:05:02.130> here<00:05:02.370> and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
milliamps as we can see right here and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.210 
milliamps as we can see right here and
it<00:05:02.700> comes<00:05:02.880> covered<00:05:03.300> with<00:05:03.510> this<00:05:03.660> tape

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
this is going to be a dual sim dual

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.120 
this is going to be a dual sim dual
standby<00:05:18.030> device<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:19.260> maybe<00:05:19.440> we<00:05:19.620> can<00:05:19.740> fit<00:05:19.950> two

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
standby device so maybe we can fit two

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.400 
standby device so maybe we can fit two
regular<00:05:20.460> size<00:05:20.670> SIM<00:05:20.910> cards<00:05:21.270> on<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.780> slide<00:05:22.050> one

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
regular size SIM cards on the slide one

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.080 
regular size SIM cards on the slide one
on<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.560> top<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.010> one<00:05:23.130> at<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.310> bottom<00:05:23.490> so

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
on the top and one at the bottom so

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.280 
on the top and one at the bottom so
that's<00:05:24.210> great<00:05:24.480> let's<00:05:24.810> go<00:05:24.900> ahead<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.140> install

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
that's great let's go ahead and install

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.200 
that's great let's go ahead and install
the<00:05:25.530> battery<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.040> see<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.580> do<00:05:26.730> have<00:05:26.910> any

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
juice on this device and here we can see

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.300 
juice on this device and here we can see
the<00:05:30.240> THL<00:05:30.690> logo<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.290> on<00:05:31.440> viewing<00:05:31.740> angles<00:05:32.160> it

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
the THL logo and on viewing angles it

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.740
