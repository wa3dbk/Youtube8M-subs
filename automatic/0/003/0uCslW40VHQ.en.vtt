00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:07.400
 Evaluate the expression 5y ^ 4 - y ^ 2, where y = 3 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.733
 So when you see y in the equation, you have to compensate for it by 3 

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:17.467
 Accordingly, the phrase 5 × 3 ^ 4 - 

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:24.892
 3 ^ 2, all I did here is that I put 3 instead of each y, put 3 here 

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:28.400
 How valuable this is, we must remember the principle of ordering operations 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.272
 Remember that brackets are given priority, or according to the PEMDAS principle 

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:39.795
 P expresses arcs, E for bases, M and D for multiplication 

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:44.333
 Divide and have the same priority, and then combine 

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.324
 Both subtraction and the same degree, then 

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:50.410
 If you want to evaluate the phrase correctly, you should start with P and E then multiply and divide 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.241
 Followed by addition and subtraction 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.000
 This is illustrated by the fact that we must first begin with arcs and exponential processes where they are given 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.800
 Priority, if we have to establish these foundations 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.898
 Before beating and subtraction 

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:09.000
 The first exponential term we will evaluate is 3 ^ 2 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.867
 Remember that 3 ^ 1 = 3, which is 3 times multiplied by itself once 

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:19.133
 The result is 3. 3 ^ 2 = 3 x 3, ie 3 multiplied 

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:24.333
 Herself twice, equal to 9, 3 ^ 3 

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:28.816
 = 3 × 3 × 3, or can be considered 

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:32.230
 K 3 ^ 2 × 3, where 3 × 3 = 9 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.600
 9 × 3 = 27, 3 ^ 4 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.561
 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3, 3 × 3 = 9 

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.000
 3 x 3 = 9, if equal to 9 × 9 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.224
 IE 81. If we just extracted the output 

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:53.333
 3 ^ 4, and we also produced 3 ^ 2 output 

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.216
 Let us now put them in the phrase, and they will become 

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.606
 5 × 3 ^ 4, 3 ^ 4 = 

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:08.667
 81, if 5 × 81, - 3 ^ 2, and we have a value of 3 ^ 2 here and it is 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:14.676
 9. 5 x 81-9, let's find the output of 5 × 81 

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:21.467
 If 81 × 5, 1 × 5 = 5, 8 × 5 = 40 

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:26.000
 If the output is 405, if we substitute it in the phrase it becomes 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.467
 405-9, is equal 

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:35.867
 If we subtract from 10 it will be output 395, but we subtract from 9 

00:02:35.867 --> 99:59:59.999
 Thus the output is 396, and so we finished
