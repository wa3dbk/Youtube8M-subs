00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.390 
I'm cool yep I don't know anyway so
that's<00:03:17.400> how<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:18.329> should<00:03:18.629> sound<00:03:18.920> I'll<00:03:19.920> slow<00:03:20.370> it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
that's how it should sound I'll slow it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.229 
that's how it should sound I'll slow it
down<00:03:20.519> for<00:03:20.879> you

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
down for you

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.740 
down for you
so<00:03:21.480> basically<00:03:21.810> you're<00:03:21.989> gonna<00:03:22.079> play<00:03:24.980> C<00:03:25.980> a

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
so basically you're gonna play C a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:35.059 
so basically you're gonna play C a
b-flat<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:28.170> G<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:30.139> B<00:03:31.139> flat<00:03:31.170> G<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:34.530> faster

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
b-flat a G a B flat G but faster

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:48.789 
b-flat a G a B flat G but faster
obviously<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:40.639> C<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:43.220> b-flat<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:45.079> G<00:03:46.609> a

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
obviously and so it's a C a b-flat a G a

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.770 
obviously and so it's a C a b-flat a G a
B<00:03:49.799> flat<00:03:50.189> G<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:52.620> that's<00:03:52.980> how<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.450> play<00:03:54.450> the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
B flat G so that's how you play the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.740 
B flat G so that's how you play the
third<00:03:55.019> part<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:56.579> know<00:03:56.700> once<00:03:57.150> again<00:03:57.450> pretty

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
third part you know once again pretty

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.470 
third part you know once again pretty
easy<00:03:58.909> you<00:03:59.909> shouldn't<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.299> much<00:04:00.420> trouble

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
easy you shouldn't have much trouble

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.619 
easy you shouldn't have much trouble
getting<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.079> down<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.299> how<00:04:03.449> the

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
getting it down and this is how the

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.390 
getting it down and this is how the
Mortal<00:04:04.019> Kombat<00:04:04.410> Theme<00:04:04.590> song<00:04:04.650> should<00:04:05.220> sound
