00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
music in this game here's a stage two I

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.949 
music in this game here's a stage two I
think<00:02:59.709> this<00:02:59.980> stage<00:03:00.579> is<00:03:00.880> sniffling<00:03:01.630> harder

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
think this stage is sniffling harder

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.930 
think this stage is sniffling harder
than<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.230> first<00:03:02.260> stage<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.489> again<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.850> all

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
than the first stage and again it's all

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.590 
than the first stage and again it's all
about<00:03:04.000> timing<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:05.489> about<00:03:06.489> how<00:03:06.730> when<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.480> get

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
about timing and about how when to get

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.400 
about timing and about how when to get
those<00:03:07.660> mics<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.859> wasn't<00:03:09.130> too<00:03:09.220> bad<00:03:10.260> at<00:03:11.260> this

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
those mics that wasn't too bad at this

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.569 
those mics that wasn't too bad at this
point<00:03:11.650> I'm<00:03:11.799> making<00:03:11.890> like<00:03:12.040> easier<00:03:12.400> than<00:03:12.519> the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
point I'm making like easier than the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.380 
point I'm making like easier than the
actual<00:03:12.670> game<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:14.730> hurt<00:03:15.730> my<00:03:15.850> foot<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.209> one

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
actual game is hurt my foot on that one

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.270 
actual game is hurt my foot on that one
now<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.200> program<00:03:17.560> she<00:03:17.739> made<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.070> game

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
now the program she made this game

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280 
now the program she made this game
actually<00:03:18.519> made<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.880> game<00:03:19.060> also<00:03:19.269> by<00:03:20.019> midway

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
actually made a game also by midway

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.710 
actually made a game also by midway
Valley<00:03:20.530> Midway<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.519> was<00:03:21.640> called<00:03:21.910> timber<00:03:22.510> which

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
Valley Midway it was called timber which

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.020 
Valley Midway it was called timber which
is<00:03:22.810> very<00:03:22.989> similar<00:03:23.230> or<00:03:23.769> domino<00:03:24.220> man<00:03:24.400> they

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
is very similar or domino man they

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.460 
is very similar or domino man they
actually<00:03:25.269> left<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.630> same<00:03:25.840> programmers<00:03:26.290> left

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
actually left the same programmers left

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.890 
actually left the same programmers left
midway<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.340> started<00:03:28.060> golden<00:03:28.540> tee<00:03:28.660> which<00:03:28.780> is

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
midway and started golden tee which is

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:39.090 
midway and started golden tee which is
interesting<00:03:34.109> there's<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.200> lot<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.410> training

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.190 

I<00:03:39.160> think<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> hit<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.300> bird<00:03:40.480> or<00:03:40.540> something<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:41.020> know

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
I think I hit a bird or something I know

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.140 
I think I hit a bird or something I know
that<00:03:41.410> is<00:03:41.560> it's<00:03:41.860> kind<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.040> funny<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:45.150> really

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
that is it's kind of funny I really

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.000 
that is it's kind of funny I really
controlling<00:03:46.600> RK<00:03:46.990> playing<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:47.980> can

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
controlling RK playing this so you can

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.920 
controlling RK playing this so you can
see<00:03:48.190> how<00:03:48.220> many<00:03:48.400> there<00:03:48.520> are<00:03:48.580> now<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:49.060> get<00:03:49.840> that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
see how many there are now I get that

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.300 
see how many there are now I get that
quickly<00:03:50.170> for<00:03:50.410> false<00:03:50.620> oh<00:03:52.980> it's<00:03:53.980> about<00:03:54.190> knowing

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
quickly for false oh it's about knowing

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.360 
quickly for false oh it's about knowing
where<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.640> go<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.000> timing<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.510> even<00:03:55.810> though

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
where to go and timing I even though

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.190 
where to go and timing I even though
it's<00:03:57.370> all<00:03:57.460> in<00:03:57.640> perspective<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.990> front

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
it's all in perspective so the front

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.260 
it's all in perspective so the front
rows<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.680> should<00:03:59.830> log<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.130> in<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.310> back<00:04:00.490> row<00:04:00.730> so

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
rows I should log it in the back row so

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.390 
rows I should log it in the back row so
you<00:04:01.330> make<00:04:01.750> sure<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.860> back<00:04:03.040> road<00:04:03.220> will<00:04:03.340> be

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
you make sure that the back road will be

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.680 
you make sure that the back road will be
no<00:04:03.520> shorter<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.060> make<00:04:04.210> sure<00:04:04.300> you<00:04:04.390> take<00:04:04.540> care

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
no shorter you make sure you take care

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.390 
no shorter you make sure you take care
that<00:04:04.810> first<00:04:05.050> at<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.380> key<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.190> it's<00:04:06.280> very

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
that first at the key so it's very

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.510 
that first at the key so it's very
challenging<00:04:06.640> or<00:04:07.030> not<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.450> same<00:04:08.430> distance<00:04:09.430> you

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
challenging or not the same distance you

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.890 
challenging or not the same distance you
know<00:04:09.700> as<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.240> can<00:04:10.330> see<00:04:10.540> because<00:04:10.750> the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
know as you can see because the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.630 
know as you can see because the
perspective<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.650> kind<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.950> excuse<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.370> little

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
perspective it kind of excuse a little

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:23.550 
perspective it kind of excuse a little
bit<00:04:12.760> Oh<00:04:13.500> see<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.590> fell<00:04:21.930> there<00:04:22.930> are<00:04:23.110> four<00:04:23.410> stages

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
bit Oh see it fell there are four stages

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.660 
bit Oh see it fell there are four stages
as<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.920> mentioned<00:04:24.250> earlier<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.580> game

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
as I mentioned earlier in this game

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.520 
as I mentioned earlier in this game
