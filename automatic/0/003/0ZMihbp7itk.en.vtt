we go ok so here we go we've got the
galaxy<00:00:27.180> s5<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> left<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.050> experience

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
galaxy s5 on the left and the experience

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.900 
galaxy s5 on the left and the experience
there<00:00:28.740> too<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.789> want

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
there too on the right and I just want

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.250 
there too on the right and I just want
to<00:00:30.000> quickly<00:00:30.150> start<00:00:30.510> off<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> design

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to quickly start off with the design

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
to quickly start off with the design
philosophies<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:32.790> these

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
philosophies now you can see from these

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.490 
philosophies now you can see from these
images<00:00:33.360> both<00:00:33.540> companies<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.200> pretty

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
images both companies have pretty

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.930 
images both companies have pretty
different<00:00:34.710> design<00:00:35.100> philosophies<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.730> look

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
different design philosophies they look

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
different design philosophies they look
wildly<00:00:36.570> different<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> Xperia<00:00:37.559> z2<00:00:37.739> has<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
bottom over the galaxy s5 they also use

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
bottom over the galaxy s5 they also use
different<00:00:42.629> materials<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.320> galaxy<00:00:43.710> s5<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
different materials the galaxy s5 is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
different materials the galaxy s5 is
still<00:00:44.399> using<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> plastic<00:00:45.360> build<00:00:45.629> which

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
still using that plastic build which

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
still using that plastic build which
either<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.379> people<00:00:46.410> hate<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.010> some<00:00:47.190> people

that's<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.829> something<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.730> people<00:00:53.820> love

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that's a something a lot of people love

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
that's a something a lot of people love
the<00:00:54.660> experience<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.500> can't<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the experience that to you can't do that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
the experience that to you can't do that
but<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> materials<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.300> premium<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
but the materials are more premium it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.049 
but the materials are more premium it
uses<00:00:58.170> aluminium<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.039> glass<00:00:59.280> combination

uses aluminium and a glass combination

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.189 
uses aluminium and a glass combination
which<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> feel<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.079> little

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
which just is going to feel that little

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.540 
which just is going to feel that little
bit<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.500> premium<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.129> hand<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.430> going

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
bit more premium in your hand it's going

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
bit more premium in your hand it's going
to<00:01:02.640> feel<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> more<00:01:03.149> expensive<00:01:03.480> device<00:01:03.989> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
to feel like a more expensive device in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
to feel like a more expensive device in
terms<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> footprints<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.119> see

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
terms of the footprints here you can see

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.969 
terms of the footprints here you can see
from<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> dimensions<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> experience

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
from the dimensions that the experience

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
from the dimensions that the experience
there<00:01:08.100> too<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.970> bit<00:01:09.060> bigger<00:01:09.299> overall

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
there too is a little bit bigger overall

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
there too is a little bit bigger overall
than<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> galaxy<00:01:11.250> s5<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> larger

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
than the galaxy s5 it's got a larger

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
than the galaxy s5 it's got a larger
footprint<00:01:12.540> only<00:01:13.080> by<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.770> that's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
footprint only by a bit but that's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
footprint only by a bit but that's
probably<00:01:14.310> accounted<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.630> slightly

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
probably accounted for for the slightly

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410 
probably accounted for for the slightly
larger<00:01:16.439> screen<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> Xperia<00:01:17.670> z2<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.210> well

larger screen on the Xperia z2 as well

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510 
larger screen on the Xperia z2 as well
in<00:01:18.659> terms<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> weight<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> galaxy<00:01:20.250> s5<00:01:20.490> is

in terms of the weight the galaxy s5 is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.940 
in terms of the weight the galaxy s5 is
145<00:01:21.509> grams<00:01:21.840> compared<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> experience

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
145 grams compared to the experience

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
145 grams compared to the experience
said<00:01:23.070> tues<00:01:23.360> 163<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.570> nearly<00:01:24.900> 20<00:01:25.409> grams<00:01:25.619> heavier

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
said tues 163 so nearly 20 grams heavier

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.340 
said tues 163 so nearly 20 grams heavier
is<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> Xperia<00:01:26.790> z2<00:01:27.090> again<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.080> probably

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is the Xperia z2 again that's probably

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
is the Xperia z2 again that's probably
down<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.829> plastic<00:01:29.310> build<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> galaxy

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
down to that plastic build on the galaxy

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.390 
down to that plastic build on the galaxy
s5<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> pros<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
s5 that is one of the pros of it but

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340 
s5 that is one of the pros of it but
it's<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.570> weighing<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.930> options

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's kind of a weighing up options

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
it's kind of a weighing up options
sometimes<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.159> light<00:01:35.340> device<00:01:35.640> doesn't

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
sometimes a really light device doesn't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.060 
sometimes a really light device doesn't
feel<00:01:36.270> premium<00:01:36.930> whereas<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> heavier<00:01:37.740> device

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
feel premium whereas a heavier device

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
feel premium whereas a heavier device
does<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.210> saying<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.570> one's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
does so I'm not saying which one's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.149 
does so I'm not saying which one's
better<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.650> something<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> take

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
better but that's just something to take

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
better but that's just something to take
into<00:01:41.310> account<00:01:41.670> ok<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.119> moving<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> galaxy

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
into account ok so moving on the galaxy

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
into account ok so moving on the galaxy

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
device I actually find the fingerprint

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
device I actually find the fingerprint
sensor<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> bit<00:01:48.630> more<00:01:48.780> useful<00:01:49.200> than<00:01:49.229> the

sensor to be a bit more useful than the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
sensor to be a bit more useful than the
heart<00:01:49.590> rate<00:01:49.740> sensor<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.250> least<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.670> opinion

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
heart rate sensor at least in my opinion

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.190

those sensors both the devices are dust

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.020 
those sensors both the devices are dust
and<00:01:58.740> water-resistant<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.729> they<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.000> a

different<00:02:00.270> IP<00:02:00.600> rating<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
different IP rating you can see that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.639 
different IP rating you can see that
they're<00:02:01.890> ip67<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> galaxy<00:02:03.360> s5<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> ip58

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
they're ip67 for the galaxy s5 and ip58

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
they're ip67 for the galaxy s5 and ip58
for<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> Xperia<00:02:06.000> z2<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.600> let<00:02:06.719> me<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.899> tell

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
for the Xperia z2 so let me just tell

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
for the Xperia z2 so let me just tell
you<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.200> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.710> these<00:02:07.920> ratings<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
you a little bit about these ratings the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.850 
you a little bit about these ratings the
first<00:02:09.179> number<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.500> protection

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
first number you see is the protection

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.530 
first number you see is the protection
against<00:02:11.310> solid<00:02:11.670> objects<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
against solid objects that's the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.449 
against solid objects that's the
protection<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.170> see<00:02:14.409> for<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.709> galaxy<00:02:15.099> s5

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
protection you can see for the galaxy s5

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.209 
protection you can see for the galaxy s5
that<00:02:15.610> six<00:02:15.939> for<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.569> Xperia<00:02:16.989> z2<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:17.829> a<00:02:17.980> five

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
that six for the Xperia z2 that's a five

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.670 
that six for the Xperia z2 that's a five
and<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.579> scale<00:02:18.939> ranges<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:19.659> zero<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.230> six

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and that scale ranges from zero to six

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.369 
and that scale ranges from zero to six
so<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.849> galaxy<00:02:22.150> s5<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.450> actually<00:02:22.900> completely

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
so the galaxy s5 is actually completely

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.699 
so the galaxy s5 is actually completely
dust<00:02:23.950> resistant<00:02:24.549> that's<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.299> six<00:02:25.599> rating<00:02:26.019> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
dust resistant that's the six rating the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.380 
dust resistant that's the six rating the
five<00:02:27.189> rating<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> experience<00:02:28.150> there<00:02:28.239> two

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
five rating on the experience there two

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
five rating on the experience there two
means<00:02:28.629> it<00:02:28.750> has<00:02:28.870> limited<00:02:29.290> protection<00:02:29.439> against

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
means it has limited protection against

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.610 
means it has limited protection against
dust<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.579> is<00:02:30.730> no<00:02:31.000> harmful<00:02:31.390> deposits<00:02:32.049> so<00:02:32.349> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
dust that is no harmful deposits so the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.229 
dust that is no harmful deposits so the
galaxy<00:02:32.920> s5<00:02:33.159> is<00:02:33.189> a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.519> bit<00:02:33.609> more<00:02:33.760> resistant

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
galaxy s5 is a little bit more resistant

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.390 
galaxy s5 is a little bit more resistant
against<00:02:34.569> dust<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.500> second<00:02:35.920> number<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.220> see

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
against dust the second number you see

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.789 
against dust the second number you see
is<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:37.000> water<00:02:37.329> intrusion<00:02:37.900> protection<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
is the water intrusion protection and

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.369 
is the water intrusion protection and
that<00:02:39.220> ranges<00:02:39.700> from<00:02:39.760> zero<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.299> eight<00:02:40.659> now<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
that ranges from zero to eight now the

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.129 
that ranges from zero to eight now the
galaxy<00:02:41.799> s5<00:02:42.010> has<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.310> seven<00:02:42.849> which<00:02:43.329> is<00:02:43.599> basically

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
galaxy s5 has a seven which is basically

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.530 
galaxy s5 has a seven which is basically
protection<00:02:45.010> against<00:02:45.370> temporary<00:02:45.939> immersion

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
protection against temporary immersion

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.539 
protection against temporary immersion
that's<00:02:46.689> why<00:02:46.840> Samsung<00:02:47.680> actually<00:02:47.980> said<00:02:48.220> don't

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
that's why Samsung actually said don't

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.399 
that's why Samsung actually said don't
leave<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.909> in<00:02:49.030> water<00:02:49.209> for<00:02:49.389> too<00:02:49.689> long<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
leave it in water for too long the

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.720 
leave it in water for too long the
experience<00:02:50.889> there<00:02:51.040> too<00:02:51.189> on<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.430> other<00:02:51.579> hand

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
experience there too on the other hand

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.460 
experience there too on the other hand
has<00:02:52.030> an<00:02:52.239> eight<00:02:52.480> which<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.109> protection

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
has an eight which is a protection

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.379 
has an eight which is a protection
against<00:02:53.980> long<00:02:54.189> periods<00:02:54.609> of<00:02:54.669> immersion<00:02:54.939> over

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
slightly larger pixel density because it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.500 
slightly larger pixel density because it

has a slightly smaller screen but

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.479 
has a slightly smaller screen but
honestly<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:38.019> probably<00:03:38.049> won't<00:03:38.560> notice<00:03:38.680> ok<00:03:39.430> so

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
honestly you probably won't notice ok so

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.280

moving on both devices have a micro SD
card<00:03:41.799> slot<00:03:41.859> so<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.280> can<00:03:42.430> expand<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.879> storage

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
that in terms of the RAM the z2 has 3

lead to overall a faster experience but

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.210 
lead to overall a faster experience but
we'll<00:04:07.720> have<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.959> see<00:04:08.109> how<00:04:08.139> aggressive<00:04:08.739> Sony<00:04:09.010> is

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
we'll have to see how aggressive Sony is

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.069 
we'll have to see how aggressive Sony is
with<00:04:09.400> their<00:04:09.519> multitasking<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.720> might<00:04:10.930> not

with their multitasking that might not

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.330 
with their multitasking that might not
be<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.349> case<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.739> it's<00:04:11.889> always<00:04:12.099> better<00:04:12.250> to

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
be the case but it's always better to

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.999 
be the case but it's always better to
have<00:04:12.489> more<00:04:12.759> ram<00:04:13.000> than<00:04:13.030> less<00:04:13.449> ram<00:04:13.689> so<00:04:14.560> moving<00:04:14.919> on

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.009 
have more ram than less ram so moving on

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.740 
have more ram than less ram so moving on
to<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.189> camera<00:04:15.699> and<00:04:15.729> this<00:04:15.939> is<00:04:16.090> kind<00:04:16.449> of<00:04:16.570> a

to the camera and this is kind of a

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.370

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
pictures you have a 14 megapixel camera

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.680 
pictures you have a 14 megapixel camera
could<00:04:29.889> actually<00:04:30.070> look<00:04:30.370> worse<00:04:30.699> than<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:31.240> camera

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
could actually look worse than a camera

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.990 
could actually look worse than a camera
with<00:04:31.810> 8<00:04:32.050> megapixels<00:04:32.740> because<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.669> loads<00:04:33.880> of

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
with 8 megapixels because of loads of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.400 
with 8 megapixels because of loads of
different<00:04:34.090> things<00:04:34.389> like<00:04:34.480> sensor<00:04:34.960> size<00:04:35.139> and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
different things like sensor size and

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.780 
different things like sensor size and
pixel<00:04:35.770> size<00:04:35.949> so<00:04:36.220> we'll<00:04:36.370> have<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.639> actually

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
pixel size so we'll have to actually

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.180 
pixel size so we'll have to actually
wait<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.270> see<00:04:37.389> what<00:04:37.570> these<00:04:37.660> devices<00:04:37.990> do<00:04:38.919> when

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
wait and see what these devices do when

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.680 
wait and see what these devices do when
they<00:04:39.310> come<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:39.850> which<00:04:40.240> camera<00:04:40.630> is

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
they come out to which camera is

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.450 
they come out to which camera is
actually<00:04:40.840> better<00:04:41.139> but<00:04:41.740> you'll<00:04:41.889> notice<00:04:42.100> here

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
actually better but you'll notice here

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.219 
actually better but you'll notice here
that<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.699> experience<00:04:43.270> said<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.690> actually<00:04:44.080> has

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
that the experience said to actually has

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.360 
that the experience said to actually has
a<00:04:44.260> bigger<00:04:44.710> sensor<00:04:45.370> than<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.690> galaxy<00:04:47.199> s5<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:48.070> a

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
a bigger sensor than the galaxy s5 so a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.800 
a bigger sensor than the galaxy s5 so a
bigger<00:04:48.729> sensor<00:04:49.060> is<00:04:49.180> always<00:04:49.389> better<00:04:49.540> because

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
bigger sensor is always better because

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.780 
bigger sensor is always better because
it<00:04:50.169> can<00:04:50.320> actually<00:04:50.440> get<00:04:50.919> more<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> shot<00:04:51.639> in

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
it can actually get more of the shot in

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.939 
it can actually get more of the shot in
at<00:04:51.940> once<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.870> that's<00:04:53.410> kind<00:04:53.710> of<00:04:53.740> interesting

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
at once so that's kind of interesting

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.830 
at once so that's kind of interesting
because<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.400> has<00:04:54.520> more<00:04:54.729> megapixels<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.449> a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
because it has more megapixels and a

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360 
because it has more megapixels and a
slightly<00:04:56.139> larger<00:04:56.380> sensor<00:04:56.800> not<00:04:56.979> by<00:04:57.100> much<00:04:57.310> but

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
slightly larger sensor not by much but

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.820 
slightly larger sensor not by much but
it<00:04:57.639> is<00:04:57.729> larger<00:04:58.240> now<00:04:58.900> I'm<00:04:59.169> not<00:04:59.350> sure<00:04:59.380> about<00:04:59.590> the

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it is larger now I'm not sure about the

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.500 
it is larger now I'm not sure about the
pixel<00:05:00.250> size<00:05:00.400> on<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.820> experience<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.270> too<00:05:01.419> it

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
pixel size on the experience that too it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.610 
pixel size on the experience that too it
doesn't<00:05:01.600> tell<00:05:01.930> me<00:05:01.960> but<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.290> can<00:05:02.410> see<00:05:02.530> the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
doesn't tell me but you can see the

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.190 
doesn't tell me but you can see the
pixel<00:05:02.950> size<00:05:03.100> there<00:05:03.430> on<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:04.000> galaxy<00:05:04.540> s5<00:05:04.870> so

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
pixel size there on the galaxy s5 so

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.420 
pixel size there on the galaxy s5 so
again<00:05:05.560> we'll<00:05:05.710> just<00:05:05.889> have<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.100> wait<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.280> see

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
again we'll just have to wait and see

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.120 
again we'll just have to wait and see
what<00:05:06.669> happens<00:05:07.030> both<00:05:07.630> these<00:05:07.930> shooter<00:05:08.290> 4k<00:05:08.740> at<00:05:08.919> 30

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
what happens both these shooter 4k at 30

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.070 
what happens both these shooter 4k at 30
frames<00:05:09.310> per<00:05:09.490> second<00:05:09.880> they<00:05:09.970> shoot<00:05:10.180> at<00:05:10.240> 1080p<00:05:10.600> at

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
frames per second they shoot at 1080p at

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.170 
frames per second they shoot at 1080p at
60<00:05:11.440> frames<00:05:11.470> per<00:05:11.740> second<00:05:12.130> both<00:05:12.639> have<00:05:12.910> slow

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
60 frames per second both have slow

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.990 
60 frames per second both have slow
motion<00:05:13.540> capture<00:05:14.050> both<00:05:14.290> have<00:05:14.650> hate<00:05:15.040> dr<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.760> all

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
motion capture both have hate dr and all

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.610 
motion capture both have hate dr and all
that<00:05:16.150> sort<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.389> stuff<00:05:16.450> so<00:05:16.900> it's<00:05:17.350> going<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.560> be

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
that sort of stuff so it's going to be

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.960 
that sort of stuff so it's going to be
really<00:05:17.800> interesting<00:05:18.370> camera<00:05:18.700> comparison

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
really interesting camera comparison

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.700 
really interesting camera comparison
between<00:05:19.300> these<00:05:19.570> two<00:05:19.720> devices<00:05:19.960> in<00:05:20.380> terms<00:05:20.620> of

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
between these two devices in terms of

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.050 
between these two devices in terms of
the<00:05:20.800> front-facing<00:05:21.160> camera<00:05:21.610> they're<00:05:21.789> pretty

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
the front-facing camera they're pretty

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.629 
the front-facing camera they're pretty
similar<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.720> Sony<00:05:23.139> Xperia<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.830> has<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.010> 2.2

some a little bit of cheating on the

some a little bit of cheating on the
benchmarks<00:05:49.630> we'll<00:05:49.720> have<00:05:49.840> to<00:05:49.960> wait<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:50.110> see

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
benchmarks we'll have to wait and see

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.750 
benchmarks we'll have to wait and see
and<00:05:50.680> what<00:05:50.919> actually<00:05:51.070> happens<00:05:51.550> with<00:05:51.729> that

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
and what actually happens with that

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.390 
and what actually happens with that
other<00:05:52.690> than<00:05:53.110> that<00:05:53.260> though<00:05:53.530> we'll<00:05:54.099> talk<00:05:54.340> about

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
other than that though we'll talk about

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
what we got here the battery life so the

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.560 
what we got here the battery life so the

there too has really made a device that
can<00:06:31.360> go<00:06:31.479> head-to-head<00:06:31.900> with<00:06:32.169> the<00:06:32.289> galaxy<00:06:32.650> s5

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
can go head-to-head with the galaxy s5

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.339 
can go head-to-head with the galaxy s5
yes<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.760> galaxy<00:06:34.120> s5<00:06:34.389> has<00:06:34.419> the<00:06:34.870> fingerprint

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
yes the galaxy s5 has the fingerprint

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.740 
yes the galaxy s5 has the fingerprint
sensor<00:06:35.740> and<00:06:35.919> also<00:06:36.250> has<00:06:36.520> the<00:06:37.120> heart<00:06:37.599> rate

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
sensor and also has the heart rate

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.240 
sensor and also has the heart rate
sensor<00:06:37.930> on<00:06:38.200> the<00:06:38.289> back<00:06:38.320> which<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:38.830> experience

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
sensor on the back which the experience

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.399 
sensor on the back which the experience
that<00:06:39.280> who<00:06:39.460> doesn't<00:06:39.789> have<00:06:39.940> but<00:06:40.750> in<00:06:40.900> my<00:06:41.020> opinion

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
that who doesn't have but in my opinion

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.499 
that who doesn't have but in my opinion
the<00:06:41.589> z2<00:06:42.009> has<00:06:42.249> the<00:06:42.399> better<00:06:42.580> design<00:06:42.999> has<00:06:43.360> the

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
the z2 has the better design has the

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.799 
the z2 has the better design has the
extra<00:06:43.719> gigabyte<00:06:44.229> of<00:06:44.349> RAM<00:06:44.619> it<00:06:45.309> has<00:06:45.580> it<00:06:46.300> may<00:06:46.539> have

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:46.809 
extra gigabyte of RAM it has it may have

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:47.999 
extra gigabyte of RAM it has it may have
the<00:06:46.959> better<00:06:47.080> camera<00:06:47.469> we'll<00:06:47.619> have<00:06:47.739> to<00:06:47.860> wait<00:06:47.949> and

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
the better camera we'll have to wait and

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.350 
the better camera we'll have to wait and
see<00:06:48.189> with<00:06:48.519> the<00:06:48.639> cameras<00:06:48.969> but<00:06:49.089> it<00:06:49.179> definitely

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
see with the cameras but it definitely

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.179 
see with the cameras but it definitely
has<00:06:49.689> that<00:06:49.719> the<00:06:49.989> larger<00:06:50.409> battery<00:06:50.769> which<00:06:50.919> should

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:51.189 
has that the larger battery which should

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:53.129 
has that the larger battery which should
lead<00:06:51.399> to<00:06:51.699> better<00:06:52.149> battery<00:06:52.569> life<00:06:52.599> even<00:06:53.050> though

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
lead to better battery life even though

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.320 
lead to better battery life even though
the<00:06:53.259> galaxy<00:06:53.589> s5<00:06:53.889> has<00:06:53.919> that<00:06:54.369> ultra<00:06:55.119> low<00:06:55.300> power

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
the galaxy s5 has that ultra low power

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.059 
the galaxy s5 has that ultra low power
mode<00:06:55.719> where<00:06:56.110> it<00:06:56.169> basically<00:06:56.259> turns<00:06:56.739> everything

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069 
mode where it basically turns everything

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.469 
mode where it basically turns everything
into<00:06:57.279> black<00:06:57.580> and<00:06:57.759> white<00:06:57.879> because<00:06:58.059> as<00:06:58.360> an

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
into black and white because as an

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.719 
into black and white because as an
AMOLED<00:06:58.779> display<00:06:59.139> but<00:06:59.739> you<00:07:00.129> can't<00:07:00.369> really<00:07:00.489> have

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
AMOLED display but you can't really have

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.850 
AMOLED display but you can't really have
any<00:07:00.879> substitute<00:07:01.509> for<00:07:01.809> more<00:07:02.080> milliamp<00:07:02.499> hours

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
any substitute for more milliamp hours

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.379 
any substitute for more milliamp hours
on<00:07:03.039> your<00:07:03.219> battery<00:07:03.639> so<00:07:03.879> we'll<00:07:04.059> have<00:07:04.179> to<00:07:04.300> wait

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
on your battery so we'll have to wait

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:05.549 
on your battery so we'll have to wait
and<00:07:04.449> see<00:07:04.569> but<00:07:04.869> it's<00:07:04.989> a<00:07:05.110> really<00:07:05.289> difficult

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:05.559 
and see but it's a really difficult

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.919 
and see but it's a really difficult
decision<00:07:05.830> between<00:07:06.339> these<00:07:06.610> two<00:07:06.729> devices<00:07:06.969> let

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:07.929 
decision between these two devices let

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:11.909 
decision between these two devices let
me<00:07:08.019> know<00:07:08.110> what<00:07:08.229> you<00:07:08.319> guys<00:07:08.469> think<00:07:08.729> peace<00:07:09.729> out
