00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.300
This time we measure fuel consumption at 90 km/h.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.220
I drove almost 9 km.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.640
Average fuel consumption at the moment is 7 l/100km.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.760
Average speed is 90 km/h.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:24.380
We're going in comfort mode, and when it comes to air conditioning, this is set to 22'C and first gear.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.320
Ahead we have the last part of the road. For about 500 meters is downhill.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.480
After 11 kilometers average fuel consumption is 7.2 l/100km.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.580
Average fuel consumption drops because the road leads gently down.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.780
At the end of the measurement result may drop even below 7 l/100km.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.120
Let's see.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.760
Now it's exit to Wieliczka.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.660
Exactly 7 l/100km at 90 km/h.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:16.080
As for the car with a V8 engine with 560 hp is pretty good.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.020
As you can see, now average fuel consumption dropped to 6.9 l/100km.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.020
Now let's embrace it for the final result.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.660
I'm already on the way back. I drove almost 10 kilometers and an average fuel consumption of less than 11 l/100km.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.220
At the final stage, the road runs gently down.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.300
I suspect that before the Skawina exit we're gonna achieve a slightly better result.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.880
Exit the motorway at 100 meters so let's see the final result.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.740
With an average speed of 120 km/h the average score is 10.6 l/100km.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.360
And now measurement of the average fuel consumption of the Audi RS6 Avant on a cold engine.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.360
The computer reset, the first engine start today.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.500
We're going in Comfort mode, air conditioning set at 22 degrees.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.880
The first indication is 25 l/100km.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.680
I think it's not bad for 560 hp under the hood.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.780
After the first kilometer, average fuel consumption is 22.4 l/100km.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.160
By the way, I want to commend the Audi, because I've never had such a comfortable reading.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.120
The screen shows all the necessary data.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.000
Average fuel consumption, average speed, mileage, etc..

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.660
I'd like to check every car, where everything is visible at a glance.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.540
Average fuel consumption after 2 kilometers 16.9 l/100km.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.440
The Audi RS6 in addition to the coolant temperature, the tachometer shows the maximum RPM range at actual temperature.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:21.200
Therefore, over time these red lines will disappear.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.400
Now we have already driven 3 km and average fuel consumption is 14 l/100km.
