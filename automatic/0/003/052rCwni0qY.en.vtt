00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.990 
inflated for a couple days now so stick
some<00:02:49.830> measurements<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.810> I'm<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.560> look

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
some measurements here I'm just to look

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.320 
some measurements here I'm just to look
at<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.270> knobs<00:02:57.590> 54.5<00:02:58.620> is<00:03:00.110> what<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.440> here

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
at the knobs 54.5 is what I have here

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.970 
at the knobs 54.5 is what I have here
not<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.630> knob<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.920> edge<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.270> tire<00:03:06.980> time

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
not to knob so the edge of the tire time

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.520 
not to knob so the edge of the tire time
to<00:03:08.160> look<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.550> casing<00:03:10.460> this<00:03:11.460> is<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.970> is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
to look at the casing this is this is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
to look at the casing this is this is
5508<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:17.550> pretty<00:03:17.730> much<00:03:17.850> 55<00:03:18.950> if<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.220> am<00:03:20.370> to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
5508 so it's pretty much 55 if I am to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.780 
5508 so it's pretty much 55 if I am to
look<00:03:20.790> at<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> thread<00:03:21.630> depth<00:03:22.610> here<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
look at the thread depth here in the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.900 
look at the thread depth here in the
center<00:03:24.240> so<00:03:27.170> that's<00:03:28.170> three<00:03:29.010> twenty<00:03:29.580> seven

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
center so that's three twenty seven

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.260 
center so that's three twenty seven
millimeters<00:03:31.040> thread<00:03:32.040> depth<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.590> side

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
millimeters thread depth on this side

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.780 
millimeters thread depth on this side
knobs<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:37.290> five<00:03:37.620> twenty<00:03:38.010> seven<00:03:38.340> millimeters

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
knobs it's five twenty seven millimeters

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.410 
knobs it's five twenty seven millimeters
so<00:03:39.150> two<00:03:40.110> millimeters<00:03:40.620> more<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.820> I'm<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.240> look

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
so two millimeters more if I'm to look

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.150 
so two millimeters more if I'm to look
at<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> height<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
at the height of this and this is to the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.250 
at the height of this and this is to the
top<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.700> knob<00:03:50.330> seventy<00:03:51.330> three<00:03:51.630> point

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260

fifty casing height is measured from the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.410 
fifty casing height is measured from the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
top of the rim to the top of the tire

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.880 
top of the rim to the top of the tire
this<00:04:00.420> was<00:04:00.600> about<00:04:00.810> 49<00:04:01.880> 175<00:04:02.880> that's<00:04:03.270> just<00:04:03.890> what's

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
this was about 49 175 that's just what's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.580 
this was about 49 175 that's just what's
called<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.310> casing<00:04:05.730> height<00:04:06.020> frame<00:04:07.020> clearance

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
called a casing height frame clearance

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.110 
called a casing height frame clearance
for<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.160> kkona<00:04:08.910> process<00:04:09.480> one<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:09.900> one<00:04:10.110> is

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
for this kkona process one one one is

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.960 
for this kkona process one one one is
quite<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.180> bit<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.130> yeah<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.340> about<00:04:14.520> eight

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
quite a bit so yeah it's about eight

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.690

about four millimeters side knobs are

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.180 
about four millimeters side knobs are
tall<00:05:03.270> I'm<00:05:04.080> measuring<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:04.590> kind<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:05.010> in<00:05:05.100> the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
tall I'm measuring this kind of in the
