they've<00:01:38.350> just<00:01:38.380> got<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.830> put<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> penalty<00:01:39.580> it's<00:01:39.700> a

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
they've just got to put a penalty it's a

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
they've just got to put a penalty it's a
yellow<00:01:40.000> card<00:01:40.420> as<00:01:40.630> well<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:42.640> Mohamed<00:01:43.060> Sabri
