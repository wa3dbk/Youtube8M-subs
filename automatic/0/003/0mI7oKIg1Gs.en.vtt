00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
there I didn't know the lining because I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.149 
there I didn't know the lining because I

standing there again a different time of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.859 
standing there again a different time of
year<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:00.709> foil<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.130> just<00:02:01.279> different<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:02.359> went

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
year the foil is just different I went

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.349 
year the foil is just different I went
back<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.439> little<00:02:04.009> bit<00:02:04.130> later<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.789> lot<00:02:05.240> of

back a little bit later a lot of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.999 
back a little bit later a lot of
flooding<00:02:05.659> up<00:02:05.869> here<00:02:06.109> so<00:02:06.349> I<00:02:06.409> can't<00:02:06.649> always<00:02:06.770> get

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
flooding up here so I can't always get

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.650
