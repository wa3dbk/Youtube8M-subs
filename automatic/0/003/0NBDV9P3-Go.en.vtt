00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
just I don't even think about them I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.850 
just I don't even think about them I
just<00:03:03.790> do<00:03:03.910> them<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.110> was<00:03:05.260> thinking<00:03:05.530> about<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
just do them if I was thinking about the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.950 
just do them if I was thinking about the
might<00:03:06.010> not<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> know<00:03:06.370> I'd<00:03:06.610> have<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.940> do<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.900> a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
might not you know I'd have to do like a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.260 
might not you know I'd have to do like a
backflip<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.860> ground<00:03:09.550> pound<00:03:09.820> before

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
backflip and the ground pound before

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.880 
backflip and the ground pound before
grabbing<00:03:10.510> every<00:03:10.870> single<00:03:11.290> banana<00:03:11.440> on<00:03:11.830> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
grabbing every single banana on the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650 
grabbing every single banana on the
ground<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:12.820> would<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.090> take<00:03:13.360> forever

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
ground and that would just take forever

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.850 
ground and that would just take forever
and<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.900> looks<00:03:14.110> like<00:03:14.230> fun<00:03:14.530> out<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.830> game

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
and that looks like fun out of the game

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.470 
and that looks like fun out of the game
I<00:03:15.040> don't<00:03:15.310> want<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.490> get<00:03:15.610> super<00:03:15.820> high<00:03:16.060> scores

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
I don't want to get super high scores

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480 
I don't want to get super high scores
it's<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.080> be<00:03:17.140> fun<00:03:17.380> which<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.310> why<00:03:18.460> I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
it's not going to be fun which is why I

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.460 
it's not going to be fun which is why I
never<00:03:19.120> really<00:03:19.450> tried<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.960> super<00:03:20.230> high

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
never really tried to get super high

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.440 
never really tried to get super high
scores<00:03:20.890> or<00:03:21.190> anything<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.790> just<00:03:22.240> go<00:03:22.420> for

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
scores or anything I just go for

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:30.380 
scores or anything I just go for
whatever<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:23.050> can<00:03:23.170> get<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> slowly<00:03:24.370> having<00:03:24.790> fun

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.570 

yeah<00:03:31.390> they're<00:03:32.200> bit<00:03:32.350> weird<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.980> there<00:03:33.250> for<00:03:33.490> no

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
yeah they're bit weird is there for no

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.220 
yeah they're bit weird is there for no
reason<00:03:34.060> they're<00:03:34.360> not<00:03:34.510> even<00:03:34.720> hard<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.140> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
reason they're not even hard this is
