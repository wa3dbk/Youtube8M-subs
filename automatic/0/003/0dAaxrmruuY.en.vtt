00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.110
 htc one wording 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.390
 we have here the abbreviation htc juan n 8 in 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.190
 we have this gray color 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.790
 clearly dark gray we also have 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.400
 light gray color and not that 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.440
 we will also have the gold coloring for 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.309
 regarding the month of May at least 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.489
 so at the presentation he described us 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.530
 htc device with features 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.720
 really impressive but that one 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 we'll see in the video review now 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.020
 we are going to open this wonderful 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 packet here here at the opening 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.560
 we clearly find the htc juan n 8 which 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
 for the moment let's put it to one side 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.229
 we are still going to open the package 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.540
 it looks like the boxes have a box 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.780
 inside the other we have it with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 my surprise a cover in a license plate 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.720
 htc a rubber cover that I have to say 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.510
 you attach so much in your pocket you do 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.580
 almost hard to insert the terminal 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.750
 inside our pockets with 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.940
 this cover but use it without really 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.190
 puts it almost chills however this is the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.290
 cover with the door also for 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.010
 go to top up or go to 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.240
 insert the headphones then the inter in 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.860
 packaging we find classic cable 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.959
 wall mounted with mirÃ² entrance can be there 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 standard and then we find the usb cable 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.600
 micro usb 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 then we find the headphones in ear that still 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.310
 not opened so clearly are the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.620
 classic in ear that we can find 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:34.260
 also in all the various packages then 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:40.890
 inside we also find a cable a 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:44.160
 cavetto cable I wanted to say pin for 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.769

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:54.269
 sim sim in micro sim format 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.890
 so finally no nano sim and then 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.100
 we also got the expansion of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.220
 memory to go and insert a micro 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.269

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.840
 adapters for ear pads 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.790
 I don't like very linear because I have it 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.700
 often quarreled with this type of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.560
 headphones because i really never get to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.580
 insert it inside mine 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.700
 pavilions but still not to do them 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.860
 jump 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.590

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.959

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.459
