the<00:03:36.620> lasers<00:03:37.040> come<00:03:37.250> out<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.549> starts<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.909> cause

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
the lasers come out that starts to cause

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.930 
the lasers come out that starts to cause
some<00:03:38.329> problems<00:03:38.780> but<00:03:39.530> still<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:40.010> think<00:03:40.069> Roxas<00:03:40.790> is

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
some problems but still I think Roxas is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.119 
some problems but still I think Roxas is
actually<00:03:41.359> one<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.810> easier<00:03:42.470> data<00:03:42.739> battles

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
actually one of the easier data battles

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.059 
actually one of the easier data battles
to<00:03:43.549> be<00:03:43.579> honest<00:03:44.200> even<00:03:45.200> though<00:03:45.409> he's<00:03:45.680> hard<00:03:45.920> at

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
to be honest even though he's hard at

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.500 
to be honest even though he's hard at
first<00:03:46.280> like<00:03:46.609> when<00:03:46.700> you're<00:03:46.849> first<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.420> know

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
first like when you're first you know

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.539 
first like when you're first you know
experiencing<00:03:48.260> him<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.950> course<00:03:49.220> he's<00:03:49.370> hard

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
experiencing him of course he's hard

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.069 
experiencing him of course he's hard
most<00:03:49.909> of<00:03:50.030> them<00:03:50.120> are<00:03:50.239> hard<00:03:50.389> at<00:03:50.510> first<00:03:50.690> except

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
most of them are hard at first except

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.170 
most of them are hard at first except
for<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.319> know<00:03:51.349> a<00:03:51.440> couple<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.889> exceptions<00:03:52.180> but

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
for you know a couple of exceptions but

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.740 
for you know a couple of exceptions but
Roxas<00:03:53.959> um<00:03:54.849> he's<00:03:55.849> hard<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.209> first<00:03:56.329> because<00:03:56.510> his

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
Roxas um he's hard at first because his

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.899 
Roxas um he's hard at first because his
attacks<00:03:57.079> are<00:03:57.260> extremely<00:03:57.319> fast<00:03:57.889> later<00:03:58.639> on

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
attacks are extremely fast later on

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.270 
attacks are extremely fast later on
though<00:03:59.200> he<00:04:00.200> just<00:04:00.409> gets<00:04:00.590> hard<00:04:00.799> because<00:04:01.099> his

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
though he just gets hard because his

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.940 
though he just gets hard because his
lasers<00:04:01.819> start<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.870> be<00:04:02.989> problematic<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.769> dodge

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
lasers start to be problematic to dodge

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.170 
lasers start to be problematic to dodge
if<00:04:04.190> you're<00:04:04.310> trying<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:04.579> dodge<00:04:04.760> them<00:04:05.000> upfront

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
if you're trying to dodge them upfront

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.110 
if you're trying to dodge them upfront
with<00:04:05.569> guards<00:04:06.049> or<00:04:06.260> dodge<00:04:06.769> rolls<00:04:07.159> you<00:04:07.639> can<00:04:07.879> dodge

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
with guards or dodge rolls you can dodge

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.550 
with guards or dodge rolls you can dodge
will<00:04:08.389> do<00:04:08.540> them<00:04:08.690> but<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:08.989> just<00:04:09.019> like<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.440> know

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
will do them but it's just like you know

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.559 
will do them but it's just like you know
risky<00:04:09.920> all<00:04:10.760> right<00:04:10.909> so<00:04:11.030> now<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.180> think<00:04:11.480> he's

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
risky all right so now I think he's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.110 
risky all right so now I think he's
gonna<00:04:11.690> start<00:04:11.900> bringing<00:04:12.139> out<00:04:12.230> lasers<00:04:12.530> yup<00:04:12.799> I

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
gonna start bringing out lasers yup I

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.939 
gonna start bringing out lasers yup I
dogs<00:04:14.120> all<00:04:14.269> too<00:04:14.389> early<00:04:14.660> okay<00:04:14.900> where<00:04:15.349> find<00:04:15.560> them

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
dogs all too early okay where find them

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.129 
dogs all too early okay where find them
see<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.579> like<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.000> glide<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.599> side<00:04:17.870> from

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
see I like to glide to the side from

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.199 
see I like to glide to the side from
these<00:04:18.349> lasers<00:04:18.739> okay<00:04:19.160> for<00:04:19.699> a<00:04:19.729> second<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.060> thought

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
these lasers okay for a second I thought

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.580 
these lasers okay for a second I thought
I'd<00:04:20.389> guarded<00:04:20.690> too<00:04:20.840> late<00:04:21.019> but<00:04:21.199> we're<00:04:21.320> fine

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
I'd guarded too late but we're fine

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.230 
I'd guarded too late but we're fine
we're<00:04:21.829> fine<00:04:21.859> we're<00:04:22.250> fine<00:04:22.280> sometimes<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:23.060> got

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
we're fine we're fine sometimes I got

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.520 
we're fine we're fine sometimes I got
you<00:04:23.389> late<00:04:23.570> on<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.810> my<00:04:23.990> apologies<00:04:24.500> but

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
you late on that my apologies but

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.500 
you late on that my apologies but
there's<00:04:25.160> no<00:04:25.250> reason<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.550> apologize<00:04:25.699> to<00:04:26.240> listen

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
there's no reason to apologize to listen

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.640 
there's no reason to apologize to listen
and<00:04:27.550> go<00:04:28.599> you<00:04:29.599> want<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.840> be<00:04:29.930> kind<00:04:30.199> of<00:04:30.260> close<00:04:30.440> to

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
and go you want to be kind of close to

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.080 
and go you want to be kind of close to
him<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:31.039> that<00:04:31.190> final<00:04:31.460> strike<00:04:31.849> hits

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
him so that that final strike hits

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.120 
him so that that final strike hits
because<00:04:32.599> every<00:04:33.110> time<00:04:33.289> you<00:04:33.470> ever<00:04:33.650> guard<00:04:34.010> that

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
because every time you ever guard that

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.620 
because every time you ever guard that
final<00:04:34.460> strike<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:34.760> will<00:04:34.880> always<00:04:35.090> get<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.419> free

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
final strike you will always get a free

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.629 
final strike you will always get a free
combo<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.169> so<00:04:36.320> that's<00:04:36.620> like<00:04:36.889> that's<00:04:37.340> like<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
combo and so that's like that's like the

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.700 
combo and so that's like that's like the
most<00:04:37.880> convenient<00:04:38.330> thing<00:04:38.560> what's<00:04:39.560> your

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
most convenient thing what's your

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.570 
most convenient thing what's your
thinking<00:04:39.919> what's<00:04:40.250> he<00:04:40.340> thinking<00:04:40.639> okay

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.600 

okay<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:49.590> we<00:04:49.710> got<00:04:49.830> his<00:04:49.979> health<00:04:50.159> almost<00:04:50.460> halfway

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
okay so we got his health almost halfway

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.219 
okay so we got his health almost halfway
down<00:04:50.909> I<00:04:50.970> don't<00:04:51.270> know<00:04:51.389> if<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.569> want<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.840> go<00:04:51.930> limit

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
down I don't know if I want to go limit

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.679 
down I don't know if I want to go limit
for<00:04:52.379> him<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:52.620> fun<00:04:52.860> or<00:04:53.039> not<00:04:53.159> I<00:04:53.370> might<00:04:54.090> need<00:04:54.419> to

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
for him for fun or not I might need to

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.179 
for him for fun or not I might need to
actually<00:04:54.870> go<00:04:55.169> in<00:04:55.319> it<00:04:55.439> later<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:55.800> I'll<00:04:55.860> save<00:04:56.159> it

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
actually go in it later so I'll save it

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.640 
actually go in it later so I'll save it
cuz<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.150> know<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.270> predict<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:57.990> know<00:04:58.080> if<00:04:58.289> I<00:04:58.469> get

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
cuz you know I predict you know if I get

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.649 
cuz you know I predict you know if I get
into<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.889> pinch<00:04:59.159> I'll<00:04:59.430> go<00:04:59.580> limit<00:04:59.879> form<00:05:00.090> not

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
into a pinch I'll go limit form not

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.809 
into a pinch I'll go limit form not

ellipses<00:05:03.270> hopefully<00:05:03.689> not<00:05:03.900> wasting<00:05:04.259> them<00:05:04.379> on

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
ellipses hopefully not wasting them on

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.219 
ellipses hopefully not wasting them on
the<00:05:05.009> data<00:05:05.280> battles<00:05:05.669> I<00:05:05.879> plan<00:05:06.659> to<00:05:06.689> use<00:05:06.840> them<00:05:07.080> for

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
the data battles I plan to use them for

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.600 
the data battles I plan to use them for
another<00:05:07.710> battle<00:05:07.949> if<00:05:08.159> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.370> what<00:05:08.520> I'm

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
another battle if you know what I'm

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.999 
another battle if you know what I'm
saying<00:05:08.969> all<00:05:09.689> right<00:05:09.930> there<00:05:10.139> we<00:05:10.259> go<00:05:10.289> yeah<00:05:10.800> it's<00:05:10.949> a

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
saying all right there we go yeah it's a

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.800 
saying all right there we go yeah it's a
very<00:05:11.219> pattern<00:05:11.849> here<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.300> that's<00:05:12.569> this<00:05:12.689> is

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
very pattern here but that's this is

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.420 
very pattern here but that's this is
just<00:05:12.960> like<00:05:13.110> my<00:05:13.319> strategy<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.919> fight<00:05:14.099> him<00:05:14.250> I

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
just like my strategy to fight him I

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.809 
just like my strategy to fight him I
like<00:05:14.969> to<00:05:15.120> put<00:05:15.449> him<00:05:15.539> into<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.810> little<00:05:16.050> pattern

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
like to put him into a little pattern

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.890 
like to put him into a little pattern
well<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:17.909> whole<00:05:18.030> fight<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.300> technically<00:05:18.840> a

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
well the whole fight is technically a

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.170 
well the whole fight is technically a
pattern<00:05:19.379> but<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.830> feel<00:05:20.520> like<00:05:20.639> rocks<00:05:20.879> is<00:05:21.060> his

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
pattern but I feel like rocks is his

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.969 
pattern but I feel like rocks is his
pattern<00:05:21.509> is<00:05:21.659> like<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.900> easiest<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.469> see<00:05:22.650> but

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
pattern is like the easiest to see but

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.200 
pattern is like the easiest to see but
that's<00:05:23.159> probably<00:05:23.280> just<00:05:23.490> because<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.789> practice

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
that's probably just because I practice

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.159 
that's probably just because I practice
him<00:05:24.360> more<00:05:24.509> than<00:05:24.629> the<00:05:24.750> others

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
him more than the others

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.770 
him more than the others
just<00:05:25.650> cuz<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:25.979> me<00:05:26.159> like<00:05:26.430> oh<00:05:26.580> okay<00:05:27.389> he<00:05:27.659> went

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
just cuz that me like oh okay he went

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.719 
just cuz that me like oh okay he went
the<00:05:27.960> other<00:05:27.990> way<00:05:28.169> that<00:05:28.289> was<00:05:28.530> cute<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:29.310> was

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
the other way that was cute that was

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.839 
the other way that was cute that was
real<00:05:29.879> cute<00:05:31.310> all<00:05:32.310> right<00:05:32.430> there<00:05:32.550> we<00:05:32.639> go<00:05:32.729> I'm

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
real cute all right there we go I'm

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.159 
real cute all right there we go I'm
probably<00:05:33.000> gonna<00:05:33.180> heal<00:05:33.389> up<00:05:33.509> at<00:05:33.659> this<00:05:33.780> combo

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
probably gonna heal up at this combo

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.320 
probably gonna heal up at this combo
healing<00:05:35.129> after<00:05:35.250> combos<00:05:35.759> I<00:05:35.879> think<00:05:36.090> for<00:05:36.270> the

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
healing after combos I think for the

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.059 
healing after combos I think for the
data<00:05:36.509> Fox<00:05:36.719> is<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.960> safest<00:05:37.440> option<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.889> heal

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
data Fox is the safest option to heal

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.920 
data Fox is the safest option to heal
always<00:05:38.819> heal<00:05:39.029> after<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.449> had<00:05:39.599> them<00:05:39.750> in<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
always heal after you had them in the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.379 
always heal after you had them in the
air<00:05:40.080> so<00:05:40.349> that<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.590> know<00:05:40.759> okay<00:05:41.759> we<00:05:42.029> got<00:05:42.180> this

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
air so that you know okay we got this

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.149 
air so that you know okay we got this

at the end when he tried to take his
Keyblade<00:06:08.279> back<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:08.639> got<00:06:08.819> a<00:06:08.849> do<00:06:09.000> reversal<00:06:09.479> on

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
Keyblade back you got a do reversal on

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.480 
Keyblade back you got a do reversal on
him<00:06:09.779> yes<00:06:10.289> usually<00:06:10.589> Roxas<00:06:11.069> is<00:06:11.219> the<00:06:11.310> one<00:06:11.430> who

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
him yes usually Roxas is the one who

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.610 
him yes usually Roxas is the one who
does<00:06:11.639> reversal<00:06:12.029> on<00:06:12.120> dust<00:06:12.389> and<00:06:12.690> so<00:06:13.020> r2<00:06:13.349> but<00:06:13.560> you

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
does reversal on dust and so r2 but you

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.329 
does reversal on dust and so r2 but you
know<00:06:13.740> Roxas

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.339 
know Roxas

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.209 
know Roxas
I<00:06:14.449> think<00:06:15.449> Roxas<00:06:15.839> is<00:06:16.020> like<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.409> icon<00:06:16.860> for<00:06:17.099> the

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
I think Roxas is like the icon for the

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.619 
I think Roxas is like the icon for the
reverse<00:06:17.490> reaction<00:06:17.759> command<00:06:18.180> just<00:06:18.389> because

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
reverse reaction command just because

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.680 
reverse reaction command just because
you<00:06:19.319> learn<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.680> with<00:06:19.800> him<00:06:19.949> but<00:06:20.300> yeah<00:06:21.300> you<00:06:21.360> do

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
you learn it with him but yeah you do

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.079 
you learn it with him but yeah you do
reversal<00:06:22.199> on<00:06:22.319> him<00:06:22.560> so<00:06:23.159> that<00:06:23.310> he<00:06:23.460> doesn't<00:06:23.759> give

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.089 
reversal on him so that he doesn't give

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:25.579 
reversal on him so that he doesn't give
you<00:06:24.180> that<00:06:24.210> smack<00:06:24.719> when<00:06:24.990> he's<00:06:25.080> trying<00:06:25.259> to<00:06:25.349> steal
