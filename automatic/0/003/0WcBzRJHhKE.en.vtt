00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:08.767
 GRIDIRON FOUR STARS 

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:12.267
 SPECIAL OPERATION ELITE TEAM 

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:17.997
 USE TACTICS FROM BATTLEFIELD 3 

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:25.567
 TO SAVE ONE OF YOUR OWNERS 

00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:31.867
 OPERATION: GRIDIRON EPISODE 3: SHOOTING 

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:39.667
 Red Bravo Overwatch, here Red Bravo Commander, at the finish in three minutes. 

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:45.367
 We can say that we live a dream. We do what we play in the game. 

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:48.997
 But in the game we have unlimited lives, so here you have to rely on friends. 

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.267
 It's an embodiment of teamwork, you can't disappoint your comrades because there's no way back. 

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:03.667
 Gentlemen, this is a sharp shooting range. 

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.367
 You're still here in our world. 

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:10.267
 You get many weapons used in Battlefield 3 

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:17.667
 M4, M249 SAW and our favorite M2 fifty. 

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:23.367
 If you can't concentrate, drag the fuck home. Here ... no mistakes. 

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:27.367
 M4 PRIMARY WEAPON 

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:34.367
 The rifles we use have a collimator. If the red dot is on the target, then the bullet will fly. 

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:45.367
 The most important thing is the power to think about it. Just aim at the target and squeeze the trigger lightly. 

00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:47.967
 A little low. 

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:55.367
 You squeeze the trigger a lot. I know, because when you ran out of ammunition, you did this. 

00:01:55.378 --> 00:02:00.867
 If you move the main shot, it will totally focus you. 

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:04.267
 The key is to slow and smooth the trigger. 

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:07.567
 See, good work. 

00:02:14.978 --> 00:02:18.467
 Stop, stop. Now you're trying to force the hit. 

00:02:19.878 --> 00:02:23.867
 When I first used something like ACOG or a collimator ... 

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:26.467
 Is that dot on that thing? 

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:30.467
 It's too much for me, it's almost as if it wasn't focused. 

00:02:30.478 --> 00:02:38.467
 Then we switched to a smaller, micro dot I think. It was much more stable. I shot them one by one. 

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:45.867
 Intervention, intervention, intervention, intervention, intervention, intervention, good work, man. 

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:48.567
 - I like it more. - Do you like the sight more? - Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:53.467
 When you ask people what the best sight is, there is no one. It's the one you shoot best with. 

00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:00.467
 M249 SAW LIGHT CALLET 

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:08.467
 Most military units have at least one of these weapons. We have several 223 modern ones. 

00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:13.467
 Because you have such a monster, you need to know how to shoot it. Great technique is being used. 

00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:16.467
 When you shoot it, you make doses of three to five. 

00:03:16.478 --> 00:03:24.467
 Focus below and then gradually higher. So first you shoot only in the rocks, the bullets are reflected so you can see the trail. 

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:29.467
 It makes you appreciate how good they are in action. Looks like you can shoot effortlessly. 

00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:36.667
 Put it on your shoulder, put it down here, it'll be easier to charge. Charge here here. 

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:45.467
 Shut it down. As soon as you press this, you're ready to shoot. 

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:50.467
 Okay, great work. 

00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:54.667
 They've been doing it for years and you really have to appreciate all the work they do. 

00:03:57.478 --> 00:04:02.367
 M2 .50 CALIBER 

00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:08.367
 So fifty is probably the biggest weapon. A really beautiful weapon, shooting about seven hundred, six hundred meters. 

00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:13.367
 Whoever will shoot today is incredibly kicking, so we loaded the tripod with sandbags. 

00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:20.267
 The ability to train with people who have it as a profession and go through it was great. 

00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:22.467
 Let's go. 

00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:41.667
 Probably the best weapon I've ever shot, I don't lie, I'll buy one for Christmas. 

00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:48.467
 I think this is from me. Here for the second time. 

00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:54.667
 Maybe this was the third time. These things are pretty deadly. 

00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:09.467
 This is all we can give you for shooting. You don't sleep much today, you have to go before dawn. 

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:31.567
