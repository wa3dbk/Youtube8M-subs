00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 from me i'm at ben iman 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.610
 set because I absolutely have to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.750
 I wanted to order because I like things 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.759
 think nice 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
 and I thought I showed up so bought 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.240
 I'm the first one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.119
 striped top here this is such a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.859
 bit shorter and he's knocking 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.000
 but usually still consider me 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.670
 whole belly because I just like that one 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 short upper body and it is at the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 slightly further cut out 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 but has a pretty high cut 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.510
 and I'm just totally beautiful 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 not so completely tight, but rather 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.620
 so a bit more relaxed and I would 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.510
 i just like to have this because i like this one 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.300
 Step out of this kind of totally cool 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.370
 I think that's super good 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.989
 combine easy to move up or up 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 pants for all kinds of things you can do that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.920
 Put on a t-shirt 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 which also has a high cut so 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
 an incoming city I say now 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.350
 and it 's just so bad 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.570
 here by the sleeves and a neckline 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 still such a dark blue wall and is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.489
 it's not so light blue with black to white 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.870
 stripes so to speak so I do not know me 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.300
 I could see it better than I could 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.739
 can explain and that will be easy too 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 but it is also a bit looser 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.850
 rather shorter are the casual style 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 So it seems not so close 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 and it also has thinner fabric so 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 It was good for the summer too 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.409
 already on and I'm totally cool out of that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 the material is totally soft and I'm 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.409
 just has such a cool look 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.080
 somehow I continue to show that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.110
 totally wanted and wanted to join him 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.460
 buy doping here and what just knows 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 maybe there is such a thing 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 in the cream-colored and above just like that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 a bit of a mother's kind of thing 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 you can be good under him 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 see-through t-shirts and sweaters and stuff 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.640
 put on and replaced quasi I think 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.790
 that's an extra accent with this 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.860
 front with this medium 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.890
 detail here and I'm totally cool 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.420
 fall because that just thinks so 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 place you want to consider and you 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.020
 just has a little extra and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.550
 you do not have to put on a top 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.900
 so now I have that once 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.040
 I 've got something in there too 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.820
 wanted the city but somehow not 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.920
 found 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.510
 this has me then agreed and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.190
 I took that once then 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.229
 even simply as a very classic 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.570
 racing white t shirt is it falls 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.330
 just so much further and has 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.770
 so a bit like an extra carrier yet 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.150
 which is you ask your images 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.910
 Do not get behind your head 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.830
 I think is totally cool and is too 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.480
 So it comes rather shorter as me something like that 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.160
 you can easily combine to everything 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.440
 and it looks really funny from the summer 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.820
 is not warm at all you feel 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.150
 you because I'm kind of so disgusting 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.240
 because summer sweats are disgusting then 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.020
 is still this pants hereby and this 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.480
 Burgundy has one more below 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.610
 kind of wanted somehow and me 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.550
 I'm totally cool, he falls down too 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.980
 and you can sleep as well 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.810
 how to attract as well as to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.410
 combine it with his cool outfit like me 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.200
 find 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.720
 and she is so cozy then the last one 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.310
 part and also my favorite part and that 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.380
 this dress is here you can get it 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.140
 completely poorly show in camera completely 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.239
 wals is that a beige one 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.790
 or cream-colored dress and 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.380
 it's even somehow and it's behind 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.570
 also really cool neckline 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.430
 it is so far and it is 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.620
 super nice especially for the summer and 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.830
