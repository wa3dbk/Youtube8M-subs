00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
so you can really tell the difference if

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
so you can really tell the difference if
you<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.800> anything<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.309> art<00:00:59.940> pencils<00:01:00.300> then

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you know they have a little bit of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
you know they have a little bit of
difference<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.030> texture<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
difference in the texture and the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
difference in the texture and the
hardness<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.320> softness<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> lead<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
hardness or softness in the lead and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
they identify those using a number or a
letter<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.490> I've<00:01:08.610> talked<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.119> bit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
letter and I've talked a little bit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.560 
letter and I've talked a little bit
about<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.200> previous<00:01:10.820> art<00:01:11.820> videos<00:01:12.270> about

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
about this in previous art videos about

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
about this in previous art videos about
art<00:01:12.810> supplies<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.500> can't<00:01:14.010> give<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
art supplies just can't give you a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.539 
art supplies just can't give you a
little<00:01:14.549> example<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> 2b<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
little example this one here is a 2b and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.330 
little example this one here is a 2b and
this<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> 3<00:01:19.200> B<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.159> one

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
this one here is a 3 B then this one

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
this one here is a 3 B then this one
here<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.580> an<00:01:20.790> HB<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.830> probably<00:01:23.100> go

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
here is an HB and actually probably go

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
here is an HB and actually probably go
like<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.790> would<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> best<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> put

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
like this would be the best way to put

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.070 
like this would be the best way to put
it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490 
it
so<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.549> HB<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> harder<00:01:28.200> led

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
so the HB is going to be a harder led

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.310 
so the HB is going to be a harder led
which<00:01:29.280> means<00:01:29.310> my<00:01:29.790> pencil<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
which means my pencil is going to have a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
which means my pencil is going to have a
lighter<00:01:32.040> line<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
lighter line but it's not going to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
lighter line but it's not going to
smudge<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.689> much<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.380> great<00:01:34.590> for

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
smudge very much so this is great for

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.219 
smudge very much so this is great for
doing<00:01:35.460> work<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> smear<00:01:37.079> or

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
doing work that I don't want to smear or

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.429 
doing work that I don't want to smear or
smudge<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> nice<00:01:38.610> light<00:01:39.000> line<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.750> would

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
smudge I want a nice light line I would

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.100 
smudge I want a nice light line I would
use<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> pencil<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.790> 2b<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.299> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
use this pencil the 2b is kind of in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.590 
use this pencil the 2b is kind of in
between<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.100> 3b<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> softer

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
between the 3b is going to have a softer

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.389 
between the 3b is going to have a softer
lead<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> nice<00:01:47.070> really

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
lead so it's going to have a nice really

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.499 
lead so it's going to have a nice really
dark<00:01:47.850> line<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.369> but<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.490> gonna<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.000> lot

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
dark line to it but it's gonna be a lot

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
dark line to it but it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.990> smudge<00:01:52.290> even<00:01:53.189> though<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.549> look

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
easier to smudge even though they look

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
easier to smudge even though they look
just<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.149> normal<00:01:54.450> pencils<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.649> vastly

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
just like normal pencils they are vastly

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
just like normal pencils they are vastly
different<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.790> sometimes<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.899> hard

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
different so sometimes that can be hard

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.230 
different so sometimes that can be hard
too<00:01:58.890> when<00:01:59.219> you're<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.549> drawing<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> you're

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
too when you're in drawing and you're

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
too when you're in drawing and you're
trying<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> find<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.780> pencil<00:02:01.140> trying<00:02:01.770> to

trying to find your pencil trying to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
trying to find your pencil trying to
find<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.549> HB<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.509> find<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
find it your HB and all you can find is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
find it your HB and all you can find is
your<00:02:03.930> 3b<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.710> kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.950> frustrating<00:02:05.100> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
your 3b and it's kind of frustrating so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
your 3b and it's kind of frustrating so
here's<00:02:06.060> an<00:02:06.210> artist<00:02:06.509> tip<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.340> my

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
here's an artist tip for you I was at my

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.589 
here's an artist tip for you I was at my
local<00:02:08.610> store<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.090> other<00:02:09.149> day<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.569> found

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
local store the other day and I found

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.380 
local store the other day and I found
these<00:02:10.110> things<00:02:10.440> called<00:02:11.220> snap<00:02:11.790> bits<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
these things called snap bits and I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.770 
these things called snap bits and I
thought

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
thought

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.630 
thought
that's<00:02:12.990> sort<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.170> stinking<00:02:13.560> fun<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.400> there

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
that's sort of stinking fun and there

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.850 
that's sort of stinking fun and there
are<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.940> little<00:02:15.150> decorative<00:02:15.870> things<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.650> put

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
are just little decorative things to put

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.470 
are just little decorative things to put
on<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.069> ends<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> your<00:02:17.459> pencils<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.209> found

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
on the ends of your pencils but I found

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.710 
on the ends of your pencils but I found
that's<00:02:19.350> much<00:02:20.100> easier<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.120> spy<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's much easier to see in spy that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's much easier to see in spy that
then<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:23.100> know<00:02:23.160> looking<00:02:23.430> through<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:23.940> my

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
then you know looking through all my

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.300 
then you know looking through all my
vast<00:02:24.360> amount<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> pencils<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:26.040> put<00:02:26.190> these

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
vast amount that pencils I can put these

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.010 
vast amount that pencils I can put these
on<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.580> favorite<00:02:26.940> pencils<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.540> be<00:02:27.720> able<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
on my favorite pencils and be able to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.780 
on my favorite pencils and be able to
identify<00:02:28.200> well<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:28.950> gonna<00:02:29.160> be<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.370> 3b<00:02:29.760> or

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
identify well that's gonna be a 3b or

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.270 
identify well that's gonna be a 3b or
whatever<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.810> works<00:02:31.080> for<00:02:31.319> me<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.890> may<00:02:32.100> not

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
whatever so this works for me it may not

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.250 
whatever so this works for me it may not
work<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.640> everybody<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.900> definitely

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
work for everybody but it definitely

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260 
work for everybody but it definitely
helps<00:02:34.770> me<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.310> able<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.610> identify<00:02:36.150> my

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
helps me to be able to identify my

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.490 
helps me to be able to identify my
pencils<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.830> let's<00:02:38.010> try<00:02:38.280> these<00:02:38.340> out

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.190 

so<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.860> snap<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.840> think<00:02:49.019> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
so you can snap it on or I think you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.890 
so you can snap it on or I think you
just<00:02:49.470> kind<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:50.120> slide<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.300> on<00:02:51.420> there<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:51.810> I'm

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
just kind of slide it on there so I'm

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.509 
just kind of slide it on there so I'm
just<00:02:51.930> gonna<00:02:52.170> slide<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.890> right<00:02:53.190> underneath

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
just gonna slide it on right underneath

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.270 
just gonna slide it on right underneath
the<00:02:53.880> HB<00:02:54.269> there<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.050> doesn't<00:02:55.230> hinder<00:02:55.769> my

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the HB there so it doesn't hinder my

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
the HB there so it doesn't hinder my
using<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.269> has<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:57.989> bit

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
using of it but it just has a little bit

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.490 
using of it but it just has a little bit
of<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.970> decorative<00:02:59.970> enos<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.840> that's<00:03:01.319> gonna

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
of a decorative enos to it that's gonna

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.199 
of a decorative enos to it that's gonna
help<00:03:01.650> me<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.920> identify<00:03:02.160> my<00:03:02.550> few<00:03:02.760> cells<00:03:02.940> much

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
help me to identify my few cells much

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:13.550 
help me to identify my few cells much
faster<00:03:11.870> cause<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.989> looks<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.350> could

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
faster cause it looks like you could

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.410 
faster cause it looks like you could
stack<00:03:13.950> them<00:03:14.160> on<00:03:14.310> top<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.580> each<00:03:14.819> other<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.150> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
stack them on top of each other so you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.350 
stack them on top of each other so you
could<00:03:15.860> make<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.010> quite<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.459> longer<00:03:17.850> layer<00:03:18.060> if

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
could make it quite the longer layer if

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.610 
could make it quite the longer layer if
you<00:03:18.390> wanted<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.900> do<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.470> could

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you wanted to do that that could

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
so I would leave that part blank but you

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.459 
so I would leave that part blank but you
could<00:05:01.330> paint<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.599> whole<00:05:01.719> thing<00:05:01.780> so<00:05:02.289> if<00:05:02.379> you
