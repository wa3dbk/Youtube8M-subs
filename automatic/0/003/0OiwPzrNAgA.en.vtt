00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.569
 good afternoon dear friends here 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.040
 look it sleeps which we got 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.660
 raw alcohol on our boiler paradigm 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 We will carry out the test 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 our distiller in the distiller two in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.869
 one 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:28.140
 here it is the first kingdom it is short 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:34.469
 no video no no installation until 1 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.610
 manat from this budget here is the wire 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:47.910
 nozzle there rp 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:53.190
 Three of roll that's just such as this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.480
 nozzle that sent me an arcade 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 Safonov this nozzle with fundamentally 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.609
 prismatic 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 of copper and what I want to do I want 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.670
 to do with this one 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.630
 wire wad so here here here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.040
 it is this pour here so here 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 top and fellow installation but in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.250
 let's try one 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.250
 what happens 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.929
 well, look at these at me jetta 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.719
 it turned out to be a bit short 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.789
 In short, there is still much left 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:44.369
 helically prismatic nozzles therefore 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.799
 I now all this nozzle to pour in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.189
 bargaining from two in one she wiki as far as 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.709
 longer additional tsorga which 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.950
 comes with two in one 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:02:04.520
 So I think it's all just enter me 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:08.819
 so let's take a look 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:14.480
 you can not see here I have this 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.599
 nozzle I do not know can not see that not all she 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.829
 now i will put it on top 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:29.040
 Here is such a way I draw your 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:32.130
 attention as tightly twisted nozzle m 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.850
 packed straight tight tight fitting 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.260
 two in one 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:44.220
 there is no free space at all 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:51.480
 In general, here, for comparison, is still empty 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:55.049
 and you can even compare freely 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.920
 comes in comes out and here 's what 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:04.410
 density and somehow pulled put 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:09.319
 above wad here here and we will 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.840
 here is such a secret this server 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.609
 so I 'll be smarter probably let it 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.299
 copper nozzle and will be inside 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.750
 I will not be able to get this one 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.750
 stock 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:35.980
 so nothing insert wad on top of everything only 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:40.420
 I put in the top we do not get enough sleep 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:46.560
 is here we have this side-bar strewn 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:49.299
 inside about that much from the top 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.579
 Only here from the bottom here in the middle 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:57.730
 we have a copper spiral 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.180
 and on the sides of the prismatic tip 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.380
 ends rather wads 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:09.790
 But with such a wire nozzle 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:15.849
 collect distillates nothing all here 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.760
 such is my distiller the moon and was 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.850
 The first part of the continuation 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.479
 should video call test spiral 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.340
 written by 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:30.419
 copper spiral prismatic caps 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.419
 goodbye to new meetings
