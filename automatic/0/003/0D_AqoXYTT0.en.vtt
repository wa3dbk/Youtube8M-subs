we<00:01:40.000> start<00:01:40.360> by<00:01:40.570> preparing<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.260> tooth<00:01:41.440> surface

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
we start by preparing the tooth surface

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.220 
we start by preparing the tooth surface
by<00:01:42.160> removing<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.850> small<00:01:43.030> amount<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.720> enamel

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
by removing a small amount of enamel

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.520 
by removing a small amount of enamel
which<00:01:44.710> helps<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.160> veneer<00:01:45.490> bond<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.210> tooth

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
which helps the veneer bond to the tooth

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.320 
which helps the veneer bond to the tooth
then<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.740> apply<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.070> thin<00:01:48.460> layer<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.760> dental

then we apply a thin layer of dental

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.570 
then we apply a thin layer of dental
cement<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.990> place<00:01:50.230> the<00:01:50.440> veneers<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.010> with
