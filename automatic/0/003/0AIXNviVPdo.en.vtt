00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.680
 Now let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.090
 technology because it is true that 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.730
 soon technology has made it easier for us 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.280
 much life but in other cases it gives us 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.680
 headaches and now finally 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.080
 technology is said in women for 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.470
 help us pocket and our 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 they just released some shoes 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.200
 technologies that will help us to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.910
 have a great diversity of shoes 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.369
 because I do not know how much you spend on 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 home in shoes next to things more 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 faces because they are supposedly what 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.340
 more will last you and also what 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.989
 you do not usually invest that much because 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.089
 in case it's expensive and you 're not changing 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 but now they just launched a new 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.079
 technology that is applied to these shoes 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.769
 so that you can change it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.769
 color see 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 Y 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 i 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 these beauties are called back and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.220
 timeless and are manufactured by a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.319
 company called issue technologies 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.269
 is one of these platforms there 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.519
 kids who have ideas to make a 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.050
 revolutionary technology and conform 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.700
 you are buying it, it becomes a 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.500
 reality because they do not have like all the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 budget to launch a collection of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.580
 shoes and sell in the world then yes 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 you go to your page they have several 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.870
 as promotions let's say and you can 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.730
 get five people to enter the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 project and they buy a pair of shoes 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.970
 they give you a pair you're good 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.950
 you get ten people they 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.810
 give two pairs and this was thanks 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.160
 You saw how I was changing right now 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.840
 color is thanks to having a 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.790
 movie like paper not like it's a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.709
 electronic paper film that a 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.840
 through bluetooth with your phone with 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.090
 your mobile device you are changing the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.280
 color is with batteries you have to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.209
 charge it to an electric current but 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.489
 they say that the battery lasts 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.129
 approximately two weeks because it occupies 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.079
 very very little then then there is 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.819
 an option because I owe them the truth 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.269
 of being carrying a shoe for one the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.670
 Shoe day for the night 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.670
 yes i do want with two sides 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.870
 it's an occasion with a little more than 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.180
 style that is not so much comfort 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.549
 because finally it is the same shoe not 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.319
 it's more than if three for the day a 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.510
 One color dress was going to be a cocktail 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.159
 in the night and you have I do not know a black sack 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.170
 then you can change the color to 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.849
 black or so you do not invest in so many 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:37.629
 shoe colors because suddenly not 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:39.939
 I know how much pasta -3 in your investment and you 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:44.340
 you dedicate a lot of the matter of fashion is 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.340
 part of your job but yes 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.659
 I do not like heels I can not 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.239
 I do not like to walk with them 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.099
 I do not have a hand, I'm also weightless 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.629
 it's quite sensible because there's nothing 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.680
 uglier than seeing a woman in high heels that 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:06.189
 do not know how to walk slow 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.329
 close your eyes because I am sorry to see 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.280
 the light from yesterday 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.870
 I realize I realize but with 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.900
 heel does not feel the same way 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.370
 then you better you put them interesas 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.989
 as a matter of practice they 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.250
 zapotes are in your case and if you get 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.120
 because nothing else like the balance today 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.120
 in to know 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.410
 Pretty little friend see that heels 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.660
 if they give you as a security and a 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.240
 very different position as what is it that 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.620
 you're talking about how it would be noses that 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.660
 we are seeing in this image that they have 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.060
 its screen is like an x-ray of the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.100
 shoe the device that is the one that does 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.620
 that this technology works they put it in 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.050
 the platform of the heel since it is this 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.199
 thing like obscura that reads and is where 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.729
 It's there and we're checking it so that 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.600
 you through the bluetooth can 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.030
 make the change 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.440
 'all to one' in an area of ​​the shoe that 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.570
 the wheel is not forgotten as I stop 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.510
 manolo as air then now what 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.039
 used to put this application 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.780
 that's good and it's pretty much what I 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.820
 like to pretend that they are parents and 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.729
 they are right and he makes the heel I always 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.610
 I say no this is not the same as you 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.800
 He wears a true outfit with heels that 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.210
 with shoes you can not see and now that I'm 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.949
 with all the subject that they have me not 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.009
 having that people and 6 from the 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:21.129
 you should start tennis 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.650
 and I do not know if the shoe is not visible 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.949
 because it's not very long I feel that you 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.199
 you have different he goes with textile iza 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.479
 correct posture suddenly because you have 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.550
 that go more will serve if you do not fall and you 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.999
 It makes it look much more slender than it 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.009
 you are 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.749
 so if it changes you and that makes you 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.490
 feel even many women makes us 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:42.189
 feel as sexy does not change the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.800
 attitude of how are you walking on how 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:48.509
 You wear a clothes that does not move in the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.509
 song with heels 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:58.479
 and in this case these shoes cost 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.309
 and they have a price of $ 499 that 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.490
 they are later yes I know what to enter each 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:05.740
 technology the shipping is free today already 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.379
 it saves good but they have three look 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.999
 this is like ten thousand pesos almost not then 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:15.249
 as if it would be the equivalent of three 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:17.529
 pairs of shoes or teeth and three more or 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.059
 less depends what happens is that I do 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:21.279
 I think what you have to invest the most 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.749
 time your clothes are on shoes not for 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.910
 another thing but because it's a matter of 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.560
 health shoes that are not good 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.930
 structured will hurt your hip 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.580
 they will damage your spine and at the end of the 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.470
 day you will end up seeing with a doctor 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.880
 with an orthopedist because heels 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.770
 when you see that your heels are 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.260
 they go in is that they are wrong 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.400
 structured then if it's not easy do not 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.800
 it's simple requires a lot of research 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.810
 and the brands invest a lot of money to 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.270
 know what a shoe that not all 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.430
 unions that do exist or I'm not from 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.500
 there the brand shoes and nothing like that 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.450
 because he has them but when there 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.570
 I buy the shoes if it hurts 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.040
 the blow or I say once you have to mark 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.860
 if you feel it or you feel it like 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.540
 we have the good in the foot as the same 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.930
 heel structure you feel 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.150
 firmly for 10 years is not that you 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.070
 It lasts a lot and also also your skin 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.720
 breathes because they are materials although 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.390
 are not synthetic profession not 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.570
 they are always leather but they are synthetic 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.700
 very fine and other times the truth nor the 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:24.400
 Foot helps you when you're using them 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:27.640
 super nasty is with the shoes 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.560
 and type 2 boots and there's also a very 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.820
 list there are also some very nice not 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.720
 you have to bring there is a tamale 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:37.380
 foot as if you do not like the taco 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.380
 rancher 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.810
 it's a very successful index shoes 

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.910
 yes, yes, but well, there it is 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.620
 you know if they want to have three in one 

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.940
 take advantage of the technology your three are 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.310
 very technological 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.330
 enter the page of your technologies and 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.330
 if they get the five friends 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.750
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.750
 information with the following videos
