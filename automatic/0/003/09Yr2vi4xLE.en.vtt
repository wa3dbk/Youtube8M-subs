00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.120
 one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.939
 to the question of the million there was or not a goal 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 of seven at the time as it looks no no 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.279
 you do not see that there is that there is no place 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.230
 you can not see that there is a lack either because 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.170
 even when when jaime goes to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 charge before you hamas charged if there was 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.430
 one of ours stuck there but 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.790
 when he sees complaint he will charge me the c 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 he leaves key when the ball comes in and he 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.790
 they 're not in it anymore it's not in the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.129
 play then passes that play is weapon 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.620
 the borbollón already therefore therefore already and not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.530
 He was why there was place but 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 well that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.090
 I do not think that doubt where sa really because 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.159
 We all left feeling that 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 there was a goal that as the legitimate and that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.880
 No reason should have been voided 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 He invited him then to remind us 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 some of the reactions of the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 Colombian residents in this of the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.030
 florida before and after the long-awaited 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.030
 match against colombia graphic 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 ah 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.750
 yellow blue and red the best flag of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.450
 colombia the yellow the gold of colombia 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.920
 the blue the two seas that surround us is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.960
 that the red blood spilled pole 0 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.740
 Colombia April 21 to continue day of the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 independence 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.510
 m 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.709
 definitely in the rhythm of the game 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.870
 to be able to be but when they are 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.020
 painting 50 years missing throughout a 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 match that rhythm you can not give a 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.770
 push from colombia strata is treated 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.739
 but unfortunately not the result 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.390
 it helped us to get very far and 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.310
 we are still champions 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.690
 Colombians with pride even though there 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.160
 lost colombia but with pride 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.170
 we won because they came to a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.910
 point where they had never arrived 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.459
 colombia keeps going colombia and water 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.800
 final delivery and played clean but 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.209
 unfortunately we did what he 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.030
 They made mexico see how to get there 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.560

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.540

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.269

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.120
 blessing to have him as a Colombian james 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.390

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.660
 selection colombia forever 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.940
 how did you see the passion for the tricolor 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.010
 Colombian and the reaction to this 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.580
 painful loss and of course the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.400
 tear of jan I think there was not a 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.990
 only Colombian that had a minimum 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.240
 doubt that Colombia could get more 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.560
 away from the way he was playing 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.930
 the team by how james who stole 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.140
 the show of all of us the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 Colombians for their goals 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.470
 the truth that before the game we are 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.810
 we are plethoric and logically 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.610
 after the game we are left with a 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.740
 sensation 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.810
 bittersweet we realized that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.790
 Brazilian football was nothing more than 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.080
 the Colombian team we realized 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.420
 that the referee had a lot to do with 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.870
 certain plays in certain things we 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.650
 we realized that the Brazilians played 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.030
 dirty we realized that when the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.150
 we squeeze 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.100
 that brasil that remains fearsome in the years 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.230
 previous voted the ball to 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.710
 any side, that is, we realized a 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.710
 a lot of things that what in the end we 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.450
 They gave satisfaction although Brazil went to 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.060
 quarterfinals and scored a marker 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.010
 2-1 the real victory was for 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.990
 colombia who won love the 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.660
 respect and admiration for their game 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.720
 clean imposing its rhythm of drag 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.010
 you are in celebration of every goal 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.100
 consolidating with the most 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.610
 appreciated by any player the booty 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.610

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.759
 paying a little step like this 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.260
 if there is a little music suddenly 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.190

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.990

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.990
