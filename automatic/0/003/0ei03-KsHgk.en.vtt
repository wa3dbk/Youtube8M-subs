00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
really only used his normal cat for the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.060 
really only used his normal cat for the
first<00:02:57.660> time<00:02:57.840> they<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.140> hey<00:02:58.290> use<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.709> one

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
first time they would hey use this one

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.860 
first time they would hey use this one
the<00:02:59.160> day<00:02:59.280> after<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.640> he<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.060> much<00:03:00.390> much<00:03:00.630> better

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the day after and he is much much better

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.260 
the day after and he is much much better
however<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.950> normal<00:03:02.220> cat<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.520> also<00:03:02.790> very<00:03:02.940> good

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
however the normal cat is also very good

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.910 
however the normal cat is also very good
and<00:03:03.480> they'll<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.020> under<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> thousand

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and they'll be like under a thousand

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.590 
and they'll be like under a thousand
coins<00:03:05.010> now<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.580> he<00:03:05.730> might<00:03:05.880> be<00:03:06.030> worth<00:03:06.180> buying<00:03:06.390> if

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
coins now so he might be worth buying if

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.880 
coins now so he might be worth buying if
you<00:03:06.660> haven't<00:03:06.870> got<00:03:06.959> many<00:03:07.110> kinds<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.500> old<00:03:07.680> guys

Ronaldo if you do not have the coins for

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.159 
Ronaldo if you do not have the coins for
Ronaldo<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.850> I'd<00:04:47.240> say<00:04:47.510> he's<00:04:47.720> probably<00:04:47.900> better

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
Ronaldo and I'd say he's probably better

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.540 
Ronaldo and I'd say he's probably better
than<00:04:48.290> David<00:04:48.530> beer<00:04:48.710> as<00:04:48.889> well<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.190> if<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.370> need<00:04:49.520> a
