00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

luckily I had a couple of light series
stored<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> gonna<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> one

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you watched any way so that you if

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
you watched any way so that you if
you're<00:00:31.859> wondering<00:00:32.040> why<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.940> had<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.210> many

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
you're wondering why we had so many

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
you're wondering why we had so many
coins<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.899> buy<00:00:34.020> our<00:00:34.070> informed<00:00:35.070> ambia

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
coins to go and buy our informed ambia

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.549 
coins to go and buy our informed ambia
there<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.290> three

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
there it's because it was like three

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.380 
there it's because it was like three
series<00:00:37.920> long<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.760> stored<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
series long so we stored up all the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
series long so we stored up all the
money<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.629> obviously<00:00:40.020> bought<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.590> massive

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
money and obviously bought a massive

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.709 
money and obviously bought a massive
player<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> start<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> series<00:00:41.969> off<00:00:42.210> anyway

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.270 
the top round cool and i gave him a
little<00:01:36.299> bit<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:37.110> brought<00:01:37.860> interact

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
little bit because he brought interact

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.670

and<00:01:38.400> sausage<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.000> made<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> 3-1<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
and sausage but that made it 3-1 and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
and sausage but that made it 3-1 and
that<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> how<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:40.979> finished<00:01:41.400> even<00:01:42.299> though<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that is how it finished even though you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.789 
that is how it finished even though you
can<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.750> they're<00:01:42.899> dumb<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.530> goals

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799

he<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.340> wasn't<00:01:44.549> playing<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.329> well<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
he really wasn't playing that well so I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
he really wasn't playing that well so I
thought<00:01:46.020> maybe<00:01:46.380> buying<00:01:47.100> another<00:01:47.250> striker<00:01:47.610> up

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
thought maybe buying another striker up

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.219 
thought maybe buying another striker up
front<00:01:48.060> straightaway<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.600> help<00:01:48.780> him<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
front straightaway would help him out so

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
front straightaway would help him out so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
called an absolute screamer straight

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.710 
called an absolute screamer straight
away<00:02:59.709> but<00:02:59.970> unfortunately<00:03:00.970> not<00:03:01.090> i<00:03:01.120> watched<00:03:01.480> it

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
away but unfortunately not i watched it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.869 
away but unfortunately not i watched it
in<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.319> highlights<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.430> thing<00:03:03.670> at<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.849> end

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
in the highlights like thing at the end

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.610 
in the highlights like thing at the end
and<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.720> definitely<00:03:04.959> looked<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:05.409> it<00:03:05.500> went

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
and it definitely looked like it went

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.430 
and it definitely looked like it went
over<00:03:05.769> but<00:03:06.430> unfortunately<00:03:06.879> not<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.720> then

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
over but unfortunately not and then

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.259 
over but unfortunately not and then
there<00:03:08.680> he<00:03:09.370> had<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> nice<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.819> throwing

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
there he had a nice little throwing

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.970 
there he had a nice little throwing
crossed<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.930> somehow<00:03:11.170> his<00:03:11.500> defender

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
crossed it in and somehow his defender

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.099 
crossed it in and somehow his defender
got<00:03:12.129> a<00:03:12.549> striker<00:03:13.030> go<00:03:13.239> ahead<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.659> it<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.840> thought

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
got a striker go ahead to it I thought

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.990 
got a striker go ahead to it I thought
keeping<00:03:14.980> may<00:03:15.129> have<00:03:15.220> saved<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.730> think<00:03:15.909> it

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
keeping may have saved and I think it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.879 
keeping may have saved and I think it
might<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:16.540> been<00:03:16.659> time<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.019> buy<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.440> nice

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
might have been time to buy a nice

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.220 
might have been time to buy a nice
little<00:03:18.099> keeper<00:03:18.430> after<00:03:18.669> this<00:03:18.790> game<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:20.139> then

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
little keeper after this game and then

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.020 
little keeper after this game and then
dumby<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.560> went<00:03:20.739> through<00:03:20.889> last<00:03:21.430> little<00:03:21.669> one<00:03:21.849> to

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
dumby I went through last little one to

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.550 
dumby I went through last little one to
he's<00:03:22.209> gonna<00:03:22.299> finish<00:03:22.510> those<00:03:22.840> home<00:03:23.139> every<00:03:23.530> day

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
he's gonna finish those home every day

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.819 
he's gonna finish those home every day
and<00:03:23.949> then<00:03:24.519> again<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.329> make<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.599> 4-1<00:03:26.049> identical

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
and then again to make it 4-1 identical

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.199 
and then again to make it 4-1 identical
to<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:26.980> last<00:03:27.190> gold<00:03:27.459> dummy<00:03:27.760> went<00:03:27.940> through<00:03:28.090> and

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
to the last gold dummy went through and

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.460 
to the last gold dummy went through and
a<00:03:28.239> fault<00:03:28.449> about<00:03:28.510> finessing<00:03:29.049> into<00:03:29.199> the<00:03:29.290> bottom

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
a fault about finessing into the bottom

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.080 
a fault about finessing into the bottom
round<00:03:29.530> corner<00:03:29.889> but<00:03:30.069> then<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.430> thought

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
round corner but then I thought

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.270 
round corner but then I thought
differently<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.989> smashed<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.919> home<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.190> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
differently and smashed it home to the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.300 
differently and smashed it home to the
bottom<00:03:33.489> right<00:03:33.669> and<00:03:33.699> that<00:03:33.940> made<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.269> 4-1<00:03:35.310> and

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
bottom right and that made it 4-1 and

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.580 
bottom right and that made it 4-1 and
then<00:03:36.489> again<00:03:36.760> dumby<00:03:37.690> went<00:03:37.930> through<00:03:38.199> but

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
then again dumby went through but

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.750 
then again dumby went through but
unfortunate<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.099> time<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.459> couldn't<00:03:39.609> go

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
unfortunate this time you couldn't go

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.509 
unfortunate this time you couldn't go
through<00:03:40.000> but<00:03:40.239> he<00:03:41.049> got<00:03:41.440> his<00:03:41.620> man<00:03:41.799> sent<00:03:42.129> off<00:03:42.250> but

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
through but he got his man sent off but

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.210 
through but he got his man sent off but
so<00:03:42.699> by<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:42.940> time<00:03:43.209> he<00:03:43.660> got<00:03:44.260> his<00:03:44.349> this<00:03:44.769> blow<00:03:44.949> sent

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
so by the time he got his this blow sent

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.740 
so by the time he got his this blow sent
off<00:03:45.310> his<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.730> think<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.940> was<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.060> centre-back<00:03:46.480> so

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
off his I think it was a centre-back so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.479 
off his I think it was a centre-back so
but<00:03:47.379> it<00:03:47.500> was<00:03:47.590> pretty<00:03:48.010> much<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.220> end<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.430> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
but it was pretty much the end of the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.129 
but it was pretty much the end of the
game<00:03:48.519> anyway<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.480> then<00:03:49.569> we<00:03:49.660> did<00:03:49.780> manage<00:03:49.930> to

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
game anyway and then we did manage to

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.439 
game anyway and then we did manage to
get<00:03:50.260> another<00:03:50.440> one<00:03:50.699> Martin's<00:03:51.699> was<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.030> acres<00:03:52.329> of

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
get another one Martin's was in acres of

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.550 
get another one Martin's was in acres of
space<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.870> he's<00:03:52.989> just<00:03:53.049> going<00:03:53.199> to<00:03:53.290> finish<00:03:53.410> that

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
space and he's just going to finish that

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.550 
space and he's just going to finish that
home<00:03:53.829> all<00:03:54.069> day<00:03:54.099> long<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:56.049> made<00:03:56.199> it<00:03:56.319> 5-1

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
home all day long and that made it 5-1

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.680 
home all day long and that made it 5-1
