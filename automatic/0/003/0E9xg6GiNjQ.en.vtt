00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.360 
ducklings which are kind of hard to
identify<00:05:34.570> since<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.410> took<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.740> leg<00:05:35.920> bands<00:05:36.130> off

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
identify since I took the leg bands off

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.710 
identify since I took the leg bands off
when<00:05:36.580> they<00:05:36.700> arrived<00:05:37.000> but<00:05:37.990> um<00:05:39.330> yeah<00:05:40.330> I'm<00:05:40.480> sure

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
when they arrived but um yeah I'm sure

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.500 
when they arrived but um yeah I'm sure
we'll<00:05:40.900> be<00:05:41.050> able<00:05:41.230> to<00:05:41.320> identify<00:05:41.800> them<00:05:41.920> soon<00:05:42.160> and

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
we'll be able to identify them soon and

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.330 
we'll be able to identify them soon and
hopefully<00:05:43.510> they'll<00:05:44.020> be<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.320> good<00:05:44.470> pet<00:05:44.740> with

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
hopefully they'll be the good pet with

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.280 
hopefully they'll be the good pet with
the<00:05:45.370> peakins
