00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
not doing that you get the idea so if

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.620 
not doing that you get the idea so if
you<00:04:59.480> need<00:04:59.600> an<00:04:59.690> open<00:04:59.960> bed<00:05:01.120> all<00:05:02.120> these<00:05:02.330> come<00:05:02.480> out

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
you need an open bed all these come out

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.230 
you need an open bed all these come out
and<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.800> can<00:05:03.950> get<00:05:04.100> all<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.760> way<00:05:04.880> up<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.150> the

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
and you can get all the way up to the

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:18.950 
and you can get all the way up to the
back<00:05:05.450> of<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.690> front<00:05:05.840> seats

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.430 

avalanche<00:05:21.539> couple<00:05:22.539> side<00:05:22.780> notes<00:05:23.879> it's<00:05:25.289> it<00:05:26.289> has

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
avalanche couple side notes it's it has

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.510 
avalanche couple side notes it's it has
the<00:05:26.710> z66<00:05:27.550> package<00:05:28.240> as<00:05:28.389> I<00:05:28.509> mentioned<00:05:28.960> earlier

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
the z66 package as I mentioned earlier

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.050 
the z66 package as I mentioned earlier
so<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:32.889> means<00:05:33.129> that<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:35.789> suspension<00:05:36.789> is

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
so that means that the suspension is

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.869 
so that means that the suspension is
upgraded<00:05:37.659> for<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:37.960> road<00:05:38.229> and<00:05:38.789> it's<00:05:39.789> a

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
upgraded for the road and it's a

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.219 
upgraded for the road and it's a
two-wheel<00:05:40.240> drive<00:05:40.569> package<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:42.900> it<00:05:43.900> takes

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
two-wheel drive package so it takes

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.409 
two-wheel drive package so it takes
corners<00:05:45.190> really<00:05:45.400> well<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.699> had<00:05:45.849> to<00:05:45.940> drive<00:05:46.180> at

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
corners really well I had to drive at

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.100 
corners really well I had to drive at
about<00:05:46.629> an<00:05:46.780> hour<00:05:46.990> yesterday<00:05:47.379> and<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:49.780> doesn't

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
about an hour yesterday and it doesn't

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.850 
about an hour yesterday and it doesn't
have<00:05:50.229> barely<00:05:50.560> any<00:05:50.740> body<00:05:51.190> roll<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:52.110> it's<00:05:53.110> it's

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
have barely any body roll and it's it's

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.189 
have barely any body roll and it's it's
smooth<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.430> riding<00:05:54.819> as<00:05:54.969> compared<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.509> the<00:05:55.629> z71

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
smooth the riding as compared to the z71

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.450 
smooth the riding as compared to the z71
package<00:05:56.530> which<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:58.840> 4x4<00:05:59.590> package<00:06:00.129> the

even having the small-block v8 in here

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.820 
even having the small-block v8 in here
still<00:06:11.180> doesn't<00:06:11.330> make<00:06:11.540> much<00:06:11.840> noise<00:06:12.139> I<00:06:12.320> mean<00:06:12.620> as

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
still doesn't make much noise I mean as

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.300 
still doesn't make much noise I mean as
compared<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:14.380> Drive<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:15.410> chrysler<00:06:16.160> pacifica

compared to I Drive a chrysler pacifica

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.500 
compared to I Drive a chrysler pacifica
pretty<00:06:17.090> much<00:06:17.210> on<00:06:17.389> a<00:06:17.449> daily<00:06:17.750> basis<00:06:18.260> that<00:06:18.949> has<00:06:19.190> a

pretty much on a daily basis that has a

pretty much on a daily basis that has a
3.5<00:06:20.510> liter<00:06:20.810> v6<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.919> that<00:06:22.610> probably<00:06:22.910> makes

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
3.5 liter v6 and that probably makes

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.840 
3.5 liter v6 and that probably makes
more<00:06:23.360> noise<00:06:23.419> in<00:06:23.810> this<00:06:24.250> cabin<00:06:25.250> noise<00:06:25.370> on<00:06:25.669> this

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
more noise in this cabin noise on this

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.050 
more noise in this cabin noise on this
is<00:06:26.030> really<00:06:26.300> limited<00:06:29.590> it's<00:06:30.590> pretty<00:06:30.889> quiet<00:06:31.100> as

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
is really limited it's pretty quiet as

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.790 
is really limited it's pretty quiet as
you<00:06:32.330> can<00:06:32.360> probably<00:06:32.720> hear<00:06:32.930> on<00:06:33.169> the<00:06:33.260> video<00:06:33.530> you

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
you can probably hear on the video you

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.550 
you can probably hear on the video you
know<00:06:33.919> there<00:06:34.550> are<00:06:34.699> some<00:06:34.910> curves<00:06:35.810> coming<00:06:36.440> up

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
know there are some curves coming up

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.790 
know there are some curves coming up
here

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.850 

just<00:06:41.430> you<00:06:41.699> know<00:06:41.840> tried<00:06:42.840> to<00:06:43.020> see<00:06:43.259> how<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:43.680> would

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
just you know tried to see how I would

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.950 
just you know tried to see how I would
handle<00:06:44.330> go<00:06:45.330> a<00:06:45.360> little<00:06:45.569> bit<00:06:45.810> faster<00:06:46.259> and<00:06:47.840> like<00:06:48.840> I

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
handle go a little bit faster and like I

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.260 
handle go a little bit faster and like I

said limited body roll sticks to the

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.980 
said limited body roll sticks to the
road<00:06:51.419> really<00:06:51.780> well<00:06:51.990> for<00:06:52.889> a<00:06:52.949> trunk<00:06:53.340> you<00:06:53.789> know

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
road really well for a trunk you know

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.600 
road really well for a trunk you know
another<00:06:54.990> thing<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.620> noticed<00:06:55.650> about<00:06:56.039> this<00:06:56.340> truck

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
another thing I noticed about this truck

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.790 
another thing I noticed about this truck
right<00:06:56.849> away<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.419> that<00:06:57.659> for<00:06:57.930> a<00:06:57.960> truck<00:06:58.349> it<00:06:58.590> wants

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
right away is that for a truck it wants

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.830 
right away is that for a truck it wants
to<00:06:58.949> it<00:06:59.099> gets<00:06:59.340> up<00:06:59.520> and<00:06:59.699> good<00:06:59.879> it's<00:07:00.240> not<00:07:00.449> really

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
to it gets up and good it's not really

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.469 
to it gets up and good it's not really
lethargic<00:07:01.620> when<00:07:02.190> you<00:07:02.460> step<00:07:02.699> on<00:07:02.879> the<00:07:02.970> gas<00:07:03.000> I'll

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
lethargic when you step on the gas I'll

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.170 
lethargic when you step on the gas I'll
show<00:07:03.659> you<00:07:03.750> that<00:07:03.870> here<00:07:04.110> in<00:07:04.139> a<00:07:04.259> minute<00:07:04.409> but<00:07:05.180> it's

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
show you that here in a minute but it's

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.020 
show you that here in a minute but it's
also<00:07:06.360> it<00:07:07.289> feels<00:07:07.680> really<00:07:07.979> nimble<00:07:08.250> for<00:07:08.699> a<00:07:08.729> truck

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
also it feels really nimble for a truck

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.869 
also it feels really nimble for a truck
you<00:07:09.240> know<00:07:09.330> not<00:07:09.659> lumbering<00:07:10.169> and<00:07:10.530> all<00:07:11.340> that<00:07:11.550> junk

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 
you know not lumbering and all that junk

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.390 
you know not lumbering and all that junk
but<00:07:12.120> I<00:07:12.180> guess<00:07:12.389> I'm<00:07:12.569> just<00:07:12.659> used<00:07:12.780> to<00:07:13.080> in<00:07:13.680> terms<00:07:14.219> of

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
but I guess I'm just used to in terms of

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.080 
but I guess I'm just used to in terms of
full-size<00:07:14.580> trucks<00:07:15.210> driving<00:07:15.569> sober<00:07:16.460> now<00:07:17.460> and

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
full-size trucks driving sober now and

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.390 
full-size trucks driving sober now and
do<00:07:18.389> a<00:07:18.419> little<00:07:18.629> bit<00:07:18.810> of<00:07:18.990> an<00:07:19.169> acceleration<00:07:20.039> video

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
do a little bit of an acceleration video

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:31.110 
do a little bit of an acceleration video
pretty<00:07:20.699> yes

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.620 

not<00:07:31.660> really<00:07:31.990> much<00:07:32.199> but<00:07:32.560> you<00:07:33.430> can<00:07:33.610> see<00:07:33.970> that<00:07:34.360> if

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.630 
not really much but you can see that if

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.780 
not really much but you can see that if
you<00:07:34.840> want<00:07:35.050> to<00:07:35.610> punch<00:07:36.610> it<00:07:36.880> it'll<00:07:37.210> get<00:07:37.360> up<00:07:37.480> and<00:07:37.660> go
