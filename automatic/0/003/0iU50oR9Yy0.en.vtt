00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
one new one these are more than half and

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.100 
one new one these are more than half and
the<00:02:09.110> other<00:02:09.140> side<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.739> more<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.099> more<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.780> so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
the other side is more and more and so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.270 
the other side is more and more and so
kind<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.220> replacement<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.069> see<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
kind of replacement you can see the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.800 
kind of replacement you can see the
difference<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> back<00:02:17.090> ones<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.450> lot<00:02:17.660> more

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
difference in the back ones a lot more

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.479 
difference in the back ones a lot more
long<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.900> kind<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> corroded<00:02:21.500> there's<00:02:22.430> a

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
long and it's kind of corroded there's a

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.240 
long and it's kind of corroded there's a
difference<00:02:22.849> between<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.450> inside<00:02:24.440> pad<00:02:24.890> and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
difference between the inside pad and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.670 
difference between the inside pad and
the<00:02:25.370> outside<00:02:25.819> pad<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.900> difference<00:02:27.470> is

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
the outside pad and that difference is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.890 
the outside pad and that difference is
there's<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:27.950> big<00:02:28.250> metal<00:02:28.790> not<00:02:29.480> bidding<00:02:29.750> but

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
there's this big metal not bidding but

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.229 
there's this big metal not bidding but
the<00:02:30.410> metal<00:02:30.590> pat<00:02:30.890> on<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.160> back<00:02:31.400> keep<00:02:32.120> him

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
the metal pat on the back keep him

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.699 
the metal pat on the back keep him
cracking<00:02:32.569> easier<00:02:33.110> because<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.410> got<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
cracking easier because it's got the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.820 
cracking easier because it's got the
Pistons<00:02:34.099> pushing<00:02:34.430> against<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.830> it's

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
Pistons pushing against it and it's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.559 
Pistons pushing against it and it's
bigger<00:02:37.190> surface<00:02:37.519> area<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.299> look<00:02:38.450> at

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
bigger surface area to if you look at

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.470 
bigger surface area to if you look at
the<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.920> sure<00:02:40.069> your<00:02:40.220> new<00:02:40.400> if<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.150> look<00:02:41.329> at

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the so I'm sure your new if you look at

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.920 
the so I'm sure your new if you look at
the<00:02:41.630> other<00:02:42.170> side<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:43.209> does<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.360> has<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.599> swoop

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the other side one does it has a swoop

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.539 
the other side one does it has a swoop
here<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.380> one<00:02:45.560> doesn't<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:45.980> flat<00:02:46.250> it's

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
here this one doesn't it's flat it's

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.050 
here this one doesn't it's flat it's
metal<00:02:47.299> it's<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.930> little<00:02:48.079> more<00:02:48.140> sturdier<00:02:49.060> put

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
metal it's a little more sturdier put

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.770 
metal it's a little more sturdier put
that<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.360> next<00:02:51.849> all<00:02:52.849> right<00:02:53.000> both<00:02:53.299> brake<00:02:53.569> pads

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that on next all right both brake pads

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.900 
that on next all right both brake pads
are<00:02:53.930> installed<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.739> on<00:02:54.950> Chevy's<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.549> really

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
are installed and on Chevy's it's really

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.850 
are installed and on Chevy's it's really
easy<00:02:56.120> they<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.599> kind<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.840> slide<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.440> place<00:02:57.650> in

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
easy they just kind of slide in place in

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.110 
easy they just kind of slide in place in
the<00:02:57.920> caliper<00:02:58.250> fits<00:02:58.459> over<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.849> caliper

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the caliper fits over and the caliper

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.539 
the caliper fits over and the caliper
holds<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.510> place<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:01.040> analytical

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
holds it in place and the analytical

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.920 
holds it in place and the analytical
force<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.180> road<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.630> spinning<00:03:02.870> around

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
force of the road of spinning around

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.259 
force of the road of spinning around
keeps<00:03:03.319> him<00:03:03.470> from<00:03:03.590> grabbing<00:03:03.829> so<00:03:04.819> basically

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
keeps him from grabbing so basically

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.039 
keeps him from grabbing so basically
what<00:03:05.360> I'm<00:03:05.450> gonna<00:03:05.569> do<00:03:05.660> here<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:08.049> caliper

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
what I'm gonna do here is the caliper

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.360 
what I'm gonna do here is the caliper
itself<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:11.299> Pistons<00:03:11.510> have<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.930> be<00:03:12.220> put<00:03:13.220> back

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
itself the Pistons have to be put back

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.430 
itself the Pistons have to be put back
in<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.670> little<00:03:13.940> bit<00:03:14.060> because<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.109> break<00:03:15.290> guys

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
in a little bit because the break guys

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.319 
in a little bit because the break guys
are<00:03:15.620> bigger<00:03:15.829> for<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.340> thing<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.850> also

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
are bigger for one thing and also

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.360 
are bigger for one thing and also
because<00:03:17.660> they<00:03:17.930> do<00:03:17.989> come<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.440> if<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.190> leave

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
because they do come out if you leave

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.069 
because they do come out if you leave
them<00:03:19.489> out<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:20.600> what<00:03:20.720> we're<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.989> do<00:03:21.049> here

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
them out so what we're going to do here

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.190 
them out so what we're going to do here
is<00:03:21.290> we're<00:03:21.530> going<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.680> take<00:03:21.889> a<00:03:21.950> c-clamp<00:03:23.200> first

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
is we're going to take a c-clamp first

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.780 
is we're going to take a c-clamp first
want<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.380> take<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.889> old<00:03:25.040> brake<00:03:25.280> pads<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.670> want

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
want to take the old brake pads you want

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520 
want to take the old brake pads you want
to<00:03:25.880> do<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.239> nice<00:03:26.420> pad<00:03:26.750> we're<00:03:27.260> put<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.470> on

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
to do this is a nice pad we're put it on

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.470 
to do this is a nice pad we're put it on
top<00:03:27.709> like<00:03:27.769> that<00:03:28.130> we're<00:03:28.940> going<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.090> put<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.239> clamp

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
top like that we're going to put a clamp

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.930 
top like that we're going to put a clamp
there<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.959> just<00:03:30.049> clamp<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.500> down<00:03:30.530> until

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
there and just clamp it down until

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.479 
there and just clamp it down until
probably<00:03:31.940> one<00:03:32.209> side<00:03:32.450> at<00:03:32.569> a<00:03:32.630> time<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:33.170> then

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
probably one side at a time and then

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.309 
probably one side at a time and then
we'll<00:03:34.489> be<00:03:34.609> good<00:03:34.639> put<00:03:35.480> them<00:03:35.600> back<00:03:35.690> inside

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
we'll be good put them back inside

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.809 
we'll be good put them back inside
themselves<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.160> then<00:03:37.250> we'll<00:03:37.400> put<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:37.609> back

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
themselves and then we'll put all back

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.750 
themselves and then we'll put all back
together<00:03:38.079> we<00:03:39.079> good<00:03:39.200> see<00:03:40.100> here<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.400> have<00:03:40.730> my

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
together we good see here I just have my

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.050 
together we good see here I just have my
giant<00:03:41.359> nine-inch<00:03:41.859> six-inch<00:03:42.859> c-clamp<00:03:43.280> right

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
giant nine-inch six-inch c-clamp right

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.629 
giant nine-inch six-inch c-clamp right
there<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.420> I'm<00:03:44.510> tighten<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:44.930> up<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.639> those

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
there and I'm tighten it up and those

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.420 
there and I'm tighten it up and those
Pistons<00:03:47.450> are<00:03:47.540> going<00:03:47.660> back<00:03:47.810> into<00:03:48.019> place<00:03:48.430> it's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
Pistons are going back into place it's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.160 
Pistons are going back into place it's
I'll<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.849> get<00:03:50.000> them<00:03:50.120> about<00:03:50.389> flush<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.079> then

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
I'll just get them about flush and then

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.089 
I'll just get them about flush and then
put<00:03:51.829> oil<00:03:53.019> all<00:03:54.019> right<00:03:54.230> we<00:03:54.380> got<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.590> brake

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
put oil all right we got the brake

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.390

all<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.790> tire<00:04:48.120> will<00:04:48.540> keep<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.870> caliper

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
all the tire will keep the caliper

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.110 
all the tire will keep the caliper
around<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.790> tire<00:04:52.160> but<00:04:53.160> it'll<00:04:53.490> probably<00:04:53.910> not

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
around the tire but it'll probably not

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.180 
around the tire but it'll probably not
be<00:04:54.210> as<00:04:54.330> effective<00:04:54.770> breaking<00:04:56.060> all<00:04:57.060> right

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
be as effective breaking all right

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
be as effective breaking all right
basically<00:04:59.190> done<00:04:59.370> here<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.730> got<00:04:59.850> the<00:05:00.000> tire

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
basically done here just got the tire

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.150 
basically done here just got the tire
back<00:05:00.240> on<00:05:00.600> we'll<00:05:01.080> do<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.290> other<00:05:01.350> side<00:05:01.620> exactly

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
back on we'll do the other side exactly

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160 
back on we'll do the other side exactly
the<00:05:02.220> same<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.090> I'll<00:05:03.240> put<00:05:03.390> tire<00:05:03.570> back<00:05:03.720> on<00:05:03.900> put
