00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.009 
in this video I will be doing a review
of<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.509> canon<00:00:07.080> RC<00:00:07.770> -<00:00:08.040> 6<00:00:08.540> radio<00:00:09.540> control

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.549 
of this canon RC - 6 radio control
remote<00:00:10.730> it's<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.000> very<00:00:12.269> simple<00:00:12.750> device<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:13.440> it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
remote it's a very simple device but it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
can come in quite handy at times so it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
can come in quite handy at times so it
works<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.650> an<00:00:16.830> infrared<00:00:17.340> transmitter<00:00:18.180> in

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you don't have a picture of yourself

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.429 
you don't have a picture of yourself
pointing<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> remote<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> camera<00:01:30.630> so

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pointing the remote at the camera so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
pointing the remote at the camera so
that's<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> find<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.700> nice<00:01:33.030> about

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that's what I find really nice about

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.660 
that's what I find really nice about
that<00:01:33.390> mode<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:35.030> when<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.479> video<00:01:37.110> mode

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
that mode and when you're in video mode

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.510 
that mode and when you're in video mode
lately<00:01:38.670> I've<00:01:38.850> been<00:01:39.060> using<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.369> adjust<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
lately I've been using it to adjust the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.620 
lately I've been using it to adjust the
camera<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> focus<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:43.200> between<00:01:43.939> videos<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
camera and focus in between videos and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.889 
camera and focus in between videos and
in<00:01:45.930> between<00:01:46.500> different<00:01:46.829> takes<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
in between different takes and all that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.200 
in between different takes and all that
so<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.780> first<00:01:52.619> mode

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so what I do is the first mode

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.320 
so what I do is the first mode
or<00:01:55.040> actually<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.159> labeled<00:01:56.580> in<00:01:56.729> Reverse<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
or actually it's labeled in Reverse so

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.490 
or actually it's labeled in Reverse so
mode<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.700> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> take<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> picture<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
mode one is going to take a picture so

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.940 
mode one is going to take a picture so
right<00:02:01.830> now<00:02:01.979> I'm<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.310> video<00:02:02.670> mode<00:02:06.560> as<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.770> can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
right now I'm in video mode as you can

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790 
right now I'm in video mode as you can
see<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.520> takes<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.000> picture<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.539> me<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.319> does

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
see that takes a picture of me it does

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.150 
see that takes a picture of me it does
focus<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.610> everything<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.319> you're<00:02:13.620> taking

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
focus and everything so if you're taking

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.610 
focus and everything so if you're taking
videos<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.520> yourself<00:02:15.120> that's<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.050> great<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.590> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
videos of yourself that's a great way to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.940 
videos of yourself that's a great way to
activate<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.700> focus<00:02:18.209> on<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:19.319> camera<00:02:19.860> on

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
way in the beginning of the video I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.330 
way in the beginning of the video I

start the video I focus it I do my

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.150 
start the video I focus it I do my
clapper<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.209> good<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.480> go

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
clapper and I'm good to go

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.050 
clapper and I'm good to go
the<00:02:35.160> second<00:02:35.850> option<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.450> has<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:38.400> start<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the second option it has is to start and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.270 
the second option it has is to start and
stop<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.360> video<00:02:39.900> I'm<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.920> use<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
stop the video I'm not going to use it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000 
stop the video I'm not going to use it
now<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> would<00:02:42.150> end<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.630> video<00:02:43.010> but

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
now because it would end the video but

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.759 
now because it would end the video but
very<00:02:44.550> simply<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.330> can<00:02:45.720> start<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.530> stop<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
very simply I can start and stop the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.340 
very simply I can start and stop the
video<00:02:46.980> while<00:02:47.610> setting<00:02:47.970> down<00:02:48.269> here<00:02:48.660> without

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
video while setting down here without

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.449 
video while setting down here without
having<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.190> go<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.880> camera<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.570> do<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
having to go to the camera and do it the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.880 
having to go to the camera and do it the
only<00:02:53.880> downside<00:02:54.390> with<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.840> setup<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.560> with

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
only downside with this setup is with

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.479 
only downside with this setup is with
the<00:02:56.040> TTY<00:02:56.580> camera<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.959> does<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.130> swivel

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the TTY camera it does not have a swivel

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.479 
the TTY camera it does not have a swivel
screen<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.690> cannot<00:03:01.470> see<00:03:01.769> what<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> camera

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
screen so I cannot see what the camera

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.360 
screen so I cannot see what the camera
is<00:03:02.519> seeing<00:03:02.970> right<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:04.410> what<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.709> tend<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.130> do

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
is seeing right now so what I tend to do

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.289 
is seeing right now so what I tend to do
is<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> take<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.150> test<00:03:06.510> shot<00:03:06.709> then<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:08.190> look<00:03:08.489> to

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
is I take a test shot then I go look to

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.890 
is I take a test shot then I go look to
see<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.019> like<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.070> composition<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
see if I like the composition and the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.470 
see if I like the composition and the
focusing<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.560> all<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.790> everything<00:03:15.239> is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
focusing and all that if everything is

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.590 
focusing and all that if everything is
fine<00:03:15.840> then<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.350> start<00:03:16.650> filming<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:18.269> not<00:03:18.570> I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
fine then I start filming and if not I

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.400 
fine then I start filming and if not I
try<00:03:19.310> changing<00:03:20.310> something<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.230> so

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
try changing something and so on and so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.920 
try changing something and so on and so
forth<00:03:22.680> until<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.430> get<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.450> right<00:03:24.600> composition

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
forth until I get the right composition

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.600 
forth until I get the right composition
that<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.590> like<00:03:26.660> as<00:03:27.660> for<00:03:28.140> compatibility<00:03:28.890> this

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
you a lot a really long time the battery

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.670 
you a lot a really long time the battery
is<00:03:58.950> built<00:03:59.370> into<00:03:59.670> this<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.380> don't<00:04:01.380> know<00:04:01.440> there

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
is built into this I don't know there

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.300 
is built into this I don't know there
seems<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.070> be<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.370> screw<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.630> little

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
seems to be a screw here and a little

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.189 
seems to be a screw here and a little
thing<00:04:05.310> here<00:04:05.579> that<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.449> can<00:04:06.660> pop<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
thing here that I think you can pop the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.670 
thing here that I think you can pop the
battery<00:04:07.590> out

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
battery out

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.470 
battery out
it's<00:04:09.160> lasted<00:04:09.820> me<00:04:10.030> for<00:04:10.660> over<00:04:11.140> two<00:04:11.470> years<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:11.830> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
it's lasted me for over two years now I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.660 
it's lasted me for over two years now I
don't<00:04:13.480> use<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.930> quite<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.320> lot<00:04:14.590> but<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:18.310> yet<00:04:18.520> the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
don't use it quite a lot but but yet the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.580 
don't use it quite a lot but but yet the
battery<00:04:19.060> life<00:04:19.270> on<00:04:19.450> this<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.810> really<00:04:20.050> good<00:04:20.320> I'm

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
battery life on this is really good I'm

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.280 
battery life on this is really good I'm
guessing<00:04:21.430> it's<00:04:21.580> one<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.880> those<00:04:22.030> little<00:04:22.290> watch

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
guessing it's one of those little watch

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.650 
guessing it's one of those little watch
batteries<00:04:23.890> or<00:04:24.070> something<00:04:24.100> like<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.660> thank
