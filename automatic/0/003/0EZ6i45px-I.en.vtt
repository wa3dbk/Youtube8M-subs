00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
reading as much on my iPad as I do an

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
reading as much on my iPad as I do an
actual<00:00:42.629> book<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.950> find<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
actual book I just I think I find it

actual book I just I think I find it
more<00:00:44.760> relaxing<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.020> easier<00:00:46.320> on

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
more relaxing because it's easier on

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.930 
more relaxing because it's easier on
your<00:00:46.500> eyes<00:00:46.649> you're<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.129> looking<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> screen

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
your eyes you're not looking at a screen

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
your eyes you're not looking at a screen
and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> read<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> bath<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> lot<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and I like to read in the bath a lot and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
and I like to read in the bath a lot and
I've<00:00:50.820> gotten<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.329> good<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.840> taking

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I've gotten really good at taking

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
I've gotten really good at taking
paperback<00:00:52.739> books<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.370> getting<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.730> wet

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
paperback books and not getting them wet

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.060 
paperback books and not getting them wet
but<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.270> some<00:00:54.449> reason<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.930> iPad<00:00:55.289> always<00:00:55.800> gets

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
but for some reason my iPad always gets

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
but for some reason my iPad always gets
wet<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.699> maybe<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.420> bigger

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
wet I think maybe because it's bigger

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
wet I think maybe because it's bigger
anyway<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> point<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> bought<00:00:59.879> both<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
anyway so the point is I bought both of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
anyway so the point is I bought both of
these<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.600> iPad<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.199> don't<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.530> them

completely<00:01:28.560> blurred<00:01:28.829> together<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.549> me<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
completely blurred together for me so I

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
completely blurred together for me so I
might<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.500> confused<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.280> happened<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.690 
might get confused on what happened in
each<00:01:33.119> book<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.290> titles<00:01:34.799> were<00:01:35.040> spirit

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
each book but the titles were spirit

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
each book but the titles were spirit

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.229 
was my favorite part of the series I
just<00:03:07.340> thought<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> author<00:03:07.700> did<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> really

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
just thought the author did a really

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.509 
just thought the author did a really
good<00:03:08.450> job<00:03:08.510> making<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:09.380> feel<00:03:09.709> two<00:03:09.950> conflicting

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
good job making you feel two conflicting

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.910 
good job making you feel two conflicting
emotions<00:03:10.640> with<00:03:11.209> rose<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.320> whole<00:03:12.530> Beauty

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920

through to the end of the series you see

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.670

ends<00:03:57.980> well<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.370> like<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.700> way<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.970> series

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
ends well I like the way the series

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.660 
ends well I like the way the series
ended<00:03:59.660> but<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.170> wasn't<00:04:00.920> ready<00:04:01.190> for<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.640> end

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
ended but I wasn't ready for it to end

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.190 
ended but I wasn't ready for it to end
so<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.150> was<00:04:02.360> kind<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.840> was<00:04:02.870> like<00:04:03.080> that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
so I was kind of it was like that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.380 
so I was kind of it was like that
bittersweet<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.310> was<00:04:04.459> a<00:04:04.489> happy<00:04:04.850> ending<00:04:04.880> but<00:04:05.330> I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
bittersweet it was a happy ending but I

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.630 
bittersweet it was a happy ending but I
wasn't<00:04:05.720> ready<00:04:05.870> for<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.230> end<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.739> in<00:04:07.549> the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
wasn't ready for it to end and in the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.210 
wasn't ready for it to end and in the
sixth<00:04:07.940> book<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.420> didn't<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
sixth book I didn't like the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.310 
sixth book I didn't like the
Sandro's<00:04:09.700> were<00:04:09.940> separated<00:04:10.600> for<00:04:10.810> pretty<00:04:11.230> much

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
Sandro's were separated for pretty much

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.010 
Sandro's were separated for pretty much
the<00:04:11.500> entire<00:04:11.710> book<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.670> did<00:04:13.210> like<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.600> Rosen

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
the entire book I did like that Rosen

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.630 
the entire book I did like that Rosen
Dimitri<00:04:14.470> we're<00:04:14.650> together<00:04:14.740> like<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.310> was

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
Dimitri we're together like that was

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.759 
Dimitri we're together like that was
definitely<00:04:16.209> like<00:04:17.019> it<00:04:17.079> should<00:04:17.410> have<00:04:17.440> been<00:04:17.620> in

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
definitely like it should have been in

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.270 
definitely like it should have been in
the<00:04:17.950> story<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:18.910> think<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.739> Lissa<00:04:20.739> had<00:04:21.100> her

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
the story but I think that Lissa had her

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.980 
the story but I think that Lissa had her
whole<00:04:21.459> thing<00:04:21.700> going<00:04:21.970> on<00:04:22.090> with<00:04:22.300> her<00:04:22.480> running

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
whole thing going on with her running

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.680 
whole thing going on with her running
for<00:04:23.170> Queen<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.890> everything<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.240> like<00:04:25.480> that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
for Queen and everything and I like that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.480 
for Queen and everything and I like that
she<00:04:25.840> got<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.170> in<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.350> end<00:04:26.440> because<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.190> wasn't

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
she got it in the end because I I wasn't

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.070 
she got it in the end because I I wasn't
sure<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.030> didn't<00:04:28.270> know<00:04:28.330> if<00:04:28.450> she<00:04:28.570> was<00:04:28.660> gonna<00:04:28.870> get

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
sure I didn't know if she was gonna get

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.220 
sure I didn't know if she was gonna get
it<00:04:29.140> also<00:04:29.590> feel<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:31.060> triangle<00:04:31.750> between

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
it also feel like the triangle between

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.040 
it also feel like the triangle between
rose<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.190> Adrian<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:33.910> Dimitri<00:04:34.450> know<00:04:34.750> if<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
rose and Adrian and Dimitri know if the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.140
