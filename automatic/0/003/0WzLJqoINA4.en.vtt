into my skin trying to keep it in the
areas<00:01:43.259> where<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.500> actually<00:01:43.680> placed<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> not

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
areas where I actually placed it and not

00:01:44.880 --> 00:02:05.080 
areas where I actually placed it and not
move<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> around<00:01:45.329> too<00:01:45.750> much

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.910 

and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.300> gonna<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.750> smaller<00:02:07.409> brush

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and then I'm gonna take a smaller brush

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.330 
and then I'm gonna take a smaller brush
and<00:02:08.570> go<00:02:09.570> down<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.320> nose<00:02:10.500> area<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.250> you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and go down the nose area and when you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.010 
and go down the nose area and when you
contour<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:11.940> nose<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.390> kind<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
contour a little bit narrower than your

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.340 
contour a little bit narrower than your
actual<00:02:14.940> nose<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.250> helps<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.760> kind<00:02:17.940> of

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
actual nose is it just helps to kind of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.420 
actual nose is it just helps to kind of
sculpt<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.650> make<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.010> look<00:02:20.160> nice<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
sculpt it and make it look nice and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280 
sculpt it and make it look nice and
narrow<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> long<00:02:21.540> nose<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.990> kind<00:02:22.230> of

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
narrow if you have a long nose I kind of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
narrow if you have a long nose I kind of
have<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.620> bit<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.130> longer<00:02:23.370> tip<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
have a little bit of a longer tip and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.420 
have a little bit of a longer tip and
that's<00:02:24.420> why<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.690> took<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.050> dark<00:02:25.290> part<00:02:25.680> at<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
that's why I took the dark part at the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.820 
that's why I took the dark part at the
bottom<00:02:26.760> or<00:02:27.570> actually<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> tip<00:02:28.320> if<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.620> will

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
bottom or actually the tip if you will

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.850 
bottom or actually the tip if you will

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and I actually moved it up a little bit

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.060 
and I actually moved it up a little bit
to<00:02:32.640> make<00:02:32.730> my<00:02:32.910> nose<00:02:33.060> look<00:02:33.239> shorter<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.739> now<00:02:34.920> I'm

and then for the temples I'm just using

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.140 
and then for the temples I'm just using
a<00:03:06.810> bigger<00:03:07.019> brush<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.430> make<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.910> look

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.449 
a bigger brush so now to make this look
more<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.570> skin<00:03:10.080> I'm<00:03:10.350> actually<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.100> set

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
more like skin I'm actually going to set

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.860 
more like skin I'm actually going to set
everything<00:03:11.610> with<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.060> powder<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.570> I'm<00:03:12.690> using

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
everything with a powder and I'm using

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.350 
everything with a powder and I'm using
Mac<00:03:13.140> mineralize<00:03:13.680> skinfinish<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:15.030> doing

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
Mac mineralize skinfinish I like doing

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.479 
Mac mineralize skinfinish I like doing
this<00:03:15.480> after<00:03:15.989> I've<00:03:16.170> contoured<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
this after I've contoured because it

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.920 
this after I've contoured because it
just<00:03:17.610> kind<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> helps<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.299> blend<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.840> all

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
just kind of helps to blend it all

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.630 
just kind of helps to blend it all
together<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.560> there's<00:03:19.739> no<00:03:19.920> harsh<00:03:20.160> lines<00:03:20.430> and

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
together so there's no harsh lines and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.550 
together so there's no harsh lines and
it<00:03:20.700> looks<00:03:20.850> more<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.360> defined<00:03:21.900> skin<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:25.260> kind

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
it looks more like defined skin so kind

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.640 
it looks more like defined skin so kind
of<00:03:25.650> go<00:03:25.860> around<00:03:25.980> buff<00:03:26.400> everything<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:30.650> then

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
of go around buff everything in and then

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.199 
of go around buff everything in and then
for<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.920> nose<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.610> go<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.090> down

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
for the nose I like to go up and down

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.009 
for the nose I like to go up and down
the<00:03:33.360> center<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.959> then<00:03:34.680> down<00:03:35.010> from<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
the center and then down from the

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.960 
the center and then down from the
contoured<00:03:37.019> areas<00:03:37.350> down<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.040> sides<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.940> I

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
contoured areas down the sides so I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.310 
contoured areas down the sides so I
don't<00:03:39.209> blend<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.870> together<00:03:40.140> too<00:03:40.739> much<00:03:42.320> but

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
don't blend it in together too much but

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.720 
don't blend it in together too much but
I<00:03:43.380> definitely<00:03:43.530> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> try<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> eliminate

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
I definitely want to try to eliminate

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.130 
I definitely want to try to eliminate
those<00:03:45.180> harsh<00:03:45.930> lines<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:48.480> don't<00:03:48.720> forget<00:03:48.959> to

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
those harsh lines and don't forget to

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.660 
those harsh lines and don't forget to
also<00:03:49.410> do<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> neck<00:03:49.890> because<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
also do the neck because this is the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.280 
also do the neck because this is the
widest<00:03:51.030> area<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.510> doesn't<00:03:51.660> get<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.019> see<00:03:52.170> as

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
widest area it doesn't get to see as

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.770 
widest area it doesn't get to see as
much<00:03:52.440> Sun<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.880> definitely<00:03:54.060> want<00:03:54.540> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
much Sun and so you definitely want to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.720
