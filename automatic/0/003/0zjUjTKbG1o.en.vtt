00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.290
 how the processes of 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.940
 demand coming to court or is it 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.030
 logical that one complicates it in a subject 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 legal but I'm not calm not the 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.550
 things that I entered 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.800
 but all good with you have been able to converse 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.529
 with sebastiÃ¡n I do not speak consists of 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.270
 I have not had a projection for a long time 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.009
 to approach you and well then I think 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.419
 that is going to be a fulfill my prohibition 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.770
 could you give me the space of the videos 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.140
 please, he's already here 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.180
 what happened then still engine but 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.470
 let's respect what the judge said because 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.470
 here is bringing you closer to me 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.400
 that if I sent a message to all the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 people who start buying grass 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.850
 of the good shepherd the new buster more and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850
 not so you will do 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.040
 how are all the cameras that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.610
 they came to see me they read me bastard not 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.610
 i have crazy 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.640
 the truth a silly nonsense I think 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.350
 that I solve things with more 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.540
 love i am more romantic to my things 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.979
 if I fight with a friend of capaciten 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.170
 the cheeks a little bit but from there we 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.430
 we arrange or we just talk to each other 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.290
 I think that the lowest one can do 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.540
 is to demand a life I never fish it 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.340
 I think he's clearly doing this 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.490
 to pursue on screen on television 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.280
 open since it did not leave for a long time 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.710
 time I think it looks in fact I think 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.330
 Since he met me, he did not fit 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.100
 that I use managed to return to television 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.680
 we already see that it has a posterity 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.509
 program in a digital book channel 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.100
 to advertise and his wife 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.259
 less interests I'm happy is and not of 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.060
 gas dead family realizing love 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.440

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.740
 problem the good calm just has more 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.759
 from a relevant to where typical axes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.759
 more things 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.329
 they call you and tell you to fix up 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.549
 The world that sent a message saw 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.450
