as<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.150> i<00:00:15.389> call<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.199> probably<00:00:17.779> five

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
as you can get i call it probably five

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.960 
as you can get i call it probably five
percent<00:00:20.480> but<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:23.070> her<00:00:23.369> belly<00:00:23.699> is

totally white and her pattern is very
interesting<00:00:28.349> i<00:00:28.699> guess<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.789> could<00:00:29.910> call<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.150> an

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
interesting i guess you could call it an

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.950 
interesting i guess you could call it an
aberrant<00:00:30.720> pattern<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.130> piebald's<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
aberrant pattern but with piebald's the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.479 
aberrant pattern but with piebald's the
pattern<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:35.180> totally<00:00:36.180> unique<00:00:37.969> to<00:00:38.969> pies<00:00:40.489> this

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489

snake hopefully is grabbing i bred her

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.690 
snake hopefully is grabbing i bred her
to<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:44.910> pied<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:46.500> only<00:00:46.829> snake<00:00:47.039> outright<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
to my pied the only snake outright or to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.690 
to my pied the only snake outright or to
this<00:00:47.910> year<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.510> goal<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.469> produce<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.520> many

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this year my goal is to produce as many

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.340 
this year my goal is to produce as many
pies<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
pies as I can I think that's the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.790 
pies as I can I think that's the
ultimate<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.920> ball<00:00:56.699> python<00:00:57.090> works<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> my

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
ultimate of ball python works and so my

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220 
ultimate of ball python works and so my
goal<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.460> produce<00:00:59.789> as<00:01:00.149> many<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
goal is to produce as many as I can and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.840 
goal is to produce as many as I can and
to<00:01:02.190> probably<00:01:02.520> hold<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.059> many<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.539> can

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
to probably hold back as many as I can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.190 
to probably hold back as many as I can
when<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.909> say<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.180> produce<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.810> talking<00:01:07.170> about

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
when I say to produce I'm talking about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.240 
when I say to produce I'm talking about
producing<00:01:07.770> pines<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:09.090> snake<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.570> probably

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
producing pines this snake will probably

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
producing pines this snake will probably
have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> clutch<00:01:11.610> hopefully<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> year<00:01:12.479> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
conversations I've had with people it

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
conversations I've had with people it
really<00:01:30.780> doesn't<00:01:31.200> matter<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.979> percentage<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
really doesn't matter the percentage of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.179 
really doesn't matter the percentage of

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
white that app ID has it will throw a

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
white that app ID has it will throw a
high<00:01:38.189> percentage<00:01:38.430> white<00:01:38.880> pine<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> low

high percentage white pine and low

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
high percentage white pine and low
percent<00:01:40.970> I'd<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.479> through

selective<00:01:43.259> grading<00:01:43.649> breeding<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
selective grading breeding that you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.770 
selective grading breeding that you
could<00:01:46.220> create<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> line<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.939> pines<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.570> throw

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
could create a line of pines that throw

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.740 
could create a line of pines that throw
consistent<00:01:49.380> high<00:01:49.680> white<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.420> mid-range<00:01:51.420> white
