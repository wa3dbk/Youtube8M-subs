00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
was the same as the original proposal

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.859 
was the same as the original proposal
which<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.899> wrong<00:02:10.110> because

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
which is just wrong because

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.539 
which is just wrong because

title of any kind right and we thought

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.479 
title of any kind right and we thought
it<00:02:14.379> was<00:02:14.470> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:14.830> slam<00:02:15.040> dunkin<00:02:15.430> it
