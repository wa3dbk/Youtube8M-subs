00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.559
 the nose of a dog is around 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.379
 many times more sensitive than that of the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.690
 people with up to 250 million 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.619
 she takes weak ones herself 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.869
 odors true 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.680
 therefore, dogs are especially good 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 for use in the area of ​​personal rescue 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 So the task one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.689
 rescue dog squad is just human 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 to search and find either in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 land or in ruins 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.270
 very often people are visiting 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.820
 who can no longer orient themselves 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.309
 do not go back because the dementia 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.989
 or children who get lost 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.110
 otherwise we have debris inserts 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.969
 less we had what it was 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.410
 then, for example, plane crash where we 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.360
 then just look for the debris 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.239
 must and just see if everyone round 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 still find someone alive 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.590
 angelika simon is with her 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.840
 labrador retriever colin at the beginning 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 Training until it is in use 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.690
 goes away so two and a half to three 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.090
 years 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 at this time will be first 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.619
 independently of the seek 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.720
 as well as displaying found persons 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.040
 built up 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.710
 only in the later course of the training 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 become the two elements 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.430
 be merged our tasks 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 always put so that the move in 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.220
 can solve every case so age appropriate 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.140
 customized 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 that starts with very small caster 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.979
 play the dog learns that first time 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 The human being there is a toy 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.689
 or what has to feed and in principle 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.790
 did not seek and then this one 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.350
 human but proves man the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.850
 I think he has my game people 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.829
 or my feed yes then you increase 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.520
 These tasks with this dog completely 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.860
 slowly 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 that means only after running then 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 then somebody disappears behind the tree 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.130
 he disappears behind a tree of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.070
 further away then will be separately 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.229
 a display completely built from 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.390
 The search backup solved where the dog 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.380
 We learn to see the people 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.380
 namely by barking 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.459
 unlike the classical person like that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.230
 Customers orient themselves to rescue dogs 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.150
 not at a before submitted 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.160
 odor sample but search 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.380
 nationwide large areas after 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.220
 human odors and can there 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.060
 continue where other methods fail 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.280
 the dog is simply the best 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.920
 biological regulatory agent if you have it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.620
 may say so because he is in one 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.140
 relatively short time very purposeful 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.640
 that could search and is the rubble 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.709
 of course it's the other side where there 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.900
 you do not come with many devices anymore 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.120
 not accessible anymore now always comes 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.709
 still through somewhere and through his 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.330
 supernase just the chance 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.830
 what to take human weather 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.370
 with other devices do not stop everything 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.370
 more would be possible 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.300
 at best, the training starts already 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.180
 at the age of puppy, but at the latest with two 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.890
 years to do the job safely 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.400
 The dogs are not allowed to be small 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.860
 his 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.350
 even very large heavy dogs are not 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.200
 Suitable as the work to your joints 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.730
 would burden very much 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.410
 Even the dog handler himself must go for one 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.990
 successful training some 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.370
 bring with you 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.680
 in addition to the prescribed minimum age 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.380
 from 18 years to the beginning of the education 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.750
 and physical fitness must be 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.320
 future rescue dog leader himself 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.870
 also acquire a lot of theoretical knowledge 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.820
 We are all trained in things like 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.800
 first aid human first aid dog 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.450
 We are complete in orientation 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.150
 That means we know how to do it 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.100
 with a gps device we bypass the forest 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.250
 Can us with map and compass 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.340
 orientate 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.150
 We learn a lot about the theory of lahn 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.010
 dog and practical tactics 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.900
 So how do we get the best deal? 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.720
 work out a success as soon as possible 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.340
 to have been the theoretical and 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.790
 Practical exam successful 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.480
 the rescue dog handler may absolve 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.890
 at the earliest with 21 years in the employment 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.500
 In addition, annually so-called 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.840
 performing group tests by 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.840
 the learned is queried again 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.700
 Colin is not the first dog 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.340
 angelika simon to the rescue dog 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.250
 training with him connects them 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.960
 a very special story 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.330
 So you already have two rescue but 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.400
 trained our 2 and a boat then 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.840
 unfortunately sometime too old and the other 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.580
 At the age of six, I'm sick of swimming 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.710
 then my sister does not have the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.480
 tv show enchanting the wishes 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.590
 are seen true and have us 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.170
 just for fun 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.430
 then join in after one 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.100
 few weeks came then already the call 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.100
 that they would like to join us and 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.020
 So it all went off then and then 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.840
 you always have the ball in the tv show 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.669
 since then he lives like everyone else 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.510
 other rescue dog also at his 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.610
 family 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.160
 just like other dogs regularly 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.419
 to go to agility colin learns 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.720
 to look for people 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.960
 he has at least training in training 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.960
 just as much
