00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:59.340
 cleaned again along it lie such 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:04.880
 records if the race has digested potatoes 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:09.230
 and it is necessary not to cook the kitchen 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.480
 5 mode and cut into cubes 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:19.170

 salt this salt and there was no pancake at all 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.980
 although many put salt but I don't see 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.960

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.060
