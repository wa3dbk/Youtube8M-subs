00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.130
 this summary what the offered by 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.540
 van den belt brokerage 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.740
 sports club enschede van bon scribbled least the passed defense comes 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.439
 visiting the hits against by neighbors 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.439
 the most offensive the most productive team 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.419
 with Mario Vvd leader in the ranks 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.429
 it is certain that there is the leader both hits against o and of course the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.009
 dangerous players peter van putten 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.239
 ballack good idea only on profit so something it's very difficult 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.629
 the arbitral trio consists of 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.929
 again responsible care Mr bommel first a system and another investigation 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.090
 as said sbs6 scored that goal twice that says a lot after four 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.820
 competitions in the main class 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 the hit credo that has already been shared fourteen times 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.590
 las vegas 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.800
 on the left celebrating this year growing in the tank are the offensive intentions of 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.630
 the home team clear 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.450
 does that mean for such a good order first on points 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.580
 the jac orie find the back line 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.920
 has someone before and after calm but the philippine forest on behalf of sports club 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 and bring rescue 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.820
 but this reason would be a big failure they had way too much respect for it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.550
 the credo hits in the initial phase 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 they were also completely overflowing you the stock market 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.710
 van putting skips comes down to numbers that asks for that ball gets the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.610
 man was on e but luckily there is for that and stealing is not his commitment sharp 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.049
 enough 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.049
 not hard enough and can save the mountain's goalkeeper 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.690
 to the sorrow of course 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.810
 jan too long 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.420
 here the circuit with his right foot 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.300
 Jan van de Berg bring rescue again 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.520
 good opportunity for the hits already got a number 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.610
 possibilities in that initial phase 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.230
 that the hits could borrow distance has been sufficient 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 that did not happen in bijsterbosch but also not convenient way here 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.370
 by a visit and charleroi 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.690
 bijsterbosch 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.340
 forest that we already will be shown aguirre 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.440
 the far east he was holding with that little water he brings 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 score on a by an advantage of the home team 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.849
 well entertained 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 no chance for the goalkeeper vandenbergh 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.540
 what happens next 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.110
 I was told earlier that there are good possibilities that are a bit more than that 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.619
 enschede had won far too much respect and therefore did not play football 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.129
 in that initial phase 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.409
 that you like that Jan Peeters heart 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.540
 and paul krabbe who thinks of how i get this frame i use here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.609
 completely overflowing are the first possibility for a possibility 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.869
 can't even call it 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.869
 for enschede and missed after about 20 minutes 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.999
 and not too much 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.329
 the hit credo on the right 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.139
 monkey ball for life even though replaced all kinds of cultures on the 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.939
 family ball just beside the goal of vandenberg 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.289
 there was also a good possibility not air 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.919
 then middle village a free kick on the head one of the dogs and therefore also go 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.889
 There were enough corazon finds 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.849
 in this one a twentieth minute of the match 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.259
 however, it doesn't work 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.129
 on the back of the head 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.919
 a river tokio that 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.359
 leaves the goalkeeper without a chance for the second time 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.699
 this afternoon and this was written by stacking a 2 0 lead 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.429
 this also made him fall down as employers' gray hair 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.389
 of course we hope not to present proposals while coaching 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.479
 the training is said to have 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.859
 hotel then good options for that 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.309
 a pivotal moment in the competition could mean the reversal 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.359
 here makaay counts out of the blue thinking anyway 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.739
 4 this year I possibly do it just when we have the test tube chest 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.229
 and then the referee closes 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.179
 from now on it's over because the first assistant has it all 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.539
 advance carpenter so indicates that we should have going here right now 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.490
 he says 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.700
 this is a makaay hand ball it will no doubt we couldn't do it well 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.309
 see 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.729
 but this week everdongenlaan and that is a turning point because you look beautiful 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.770
 price about the change 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.270
 fun in the 28th minute 2 and then sit in one go 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.879
 sports club enschede good again in the match fine as a free kick nothing 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.150
 of saying 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.100
 but a sharp time to get our eyes from the referee Almelo the cock the man 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.659
 she would be without a diploma but the tribe is at least two one 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.960
 then it will not change great 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.620
 bijsterbosch unhappy man 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.520
 goes out 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.360
 also bringing the front man out 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.729
 with my experience that it is already at the lesson because he could not hold a ball yet 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.210
 that afternoon and that is really a turning point 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.580
 free kick of the 2 0 in the hands of van vandenbergh immediately seeks the people in the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.800
 adult 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.289
 that would yield something and then it would become our friendly appearance 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.720
 russia delven 2 3 in the advantage of the home team you think you can 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.659
 it did the construction in the second half 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.479
 first a surprise 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.860
 but just not surprising enough for goalkeeper erik makaay 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 this shot of the number 9 blackbird 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.990
 but the hits it is still the only 2 0 4 behind goalkeeper of the mountain 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.449
 after the break 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.069
 but the ball stays in front of the line and the tracks remain unchanged 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.449
 country slowly but surely the enschede people become a little bolder and then state 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.770
 he improving 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.979
 the companies say they are being put completely silent on the street 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.599
 I am bringing the score to the same level in the 74th minute 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.089
 ball loss 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:48.520
 so middle village not at the lesson 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.870
 and the rest of the defense traffic is positioned 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.370
 and it is just like that 2 against 2 so a huge damper 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.439
 for the vegetable cups 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.119
 that you try then 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:00.729
 here a cross 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.219
 at least that was meant as a cross 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.930
 the ball disappears the roof of the goal 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.199
 you don't really get a shot of a region from a great distance 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.450
 harmless but also no hit for ramon passes 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.569
 may the hits or what they are trying to give you a very simple ball here 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.559
 but fortunately over 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:24.969
 has arranged that we are far beyond the goal 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.569
 Hereby last and possibly from three more bottoms against the bottom of the bar but 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:29.939
 remains one for the line 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.780
 in this 4 lead for the hits against 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.099
 that's what it looks like hertha bsc 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.990
 provided a stunt 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.129
 because the referee of oudheusden lock them up for the final signal 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.930
 lasting hits we are against the master in the 2 2 equal against 

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:49.929
 people week yes that was the first half hour was dramatic 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.839
 yes the right the two are laughing i think it will be a it will be a very different about it 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.539
 it was for me though they are still so for the hits 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.009
 w combine and that sometimes someone has one 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.740
 mend possible when combining often just a bit too much I don't know the short one 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.559
 moments to choose from 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.559
 in a shot at goal or the free man to play but yes that 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.710
 that has been a few weeks so I will not be careful but that is one 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.830
 walk a bit to the end to a few players in the team and I want that 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.800
 change but I didn't want to take it too much because it will include some 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.699
 return two weeks back weeks two weeks a year so you make a total of twelve 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.550
 today the weather is falling as far as the tunnel, unfortunately you have to ticket a bit insufficient 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.970
 from that free kick on the sixteen meter 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.900
 let it be sold so that we have all seen it wrong 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.100
 He writes that he is already helping a whole herd just before that 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.719
 bordeaux is getting more aggressive to start winning duels 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:42.309
 with two hours before it is admittedly with 2 one 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:46.229
 you should not actually lose that and with our qualities like 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:47.530
 we are not afraid 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.129
 play our own game 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:53.719
 they want them and dare to win and have to win then we can go for it 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:57.830
 make sure we remain a solid or az we have nothing to the competition is again 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.309
 an example of 

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:00.150
 I think 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.000
 but I also have them after four times as coaster are the four matches 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.780
 old we then score the acting existing above name but that gives one 

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.920
 tea party on today's year a win and bayer all that already 

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:16.030
 can say again that that solo attic will be easy but it turned out 

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.069
 today the second half in particular 

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:19.050
 successful
