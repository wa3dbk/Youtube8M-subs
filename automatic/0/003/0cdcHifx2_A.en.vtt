00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.859
 I have a small space several weeks ago 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 and seeing what it is 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.949
 the water are being produced 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.289
 We saw the need 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.679
 it is manufactured 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.730
 a homemade filter 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 can send water and can some 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.499
 with some more inhabitants 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.499
 for this we need some things that are basic 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.240
 if not difficult to get 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.690
 psoe being some supermarket we can get 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.100
 a paper 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
 how do we want x rebound 3 as 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 he took it with the breach in Kiev commercial store 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.630
 those who suffer 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.090
 the possible ones yes 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.450
 the pressure 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.320
 but when we go to see some things or moral we have added and some things 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.940
 in this case 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.550
 internally 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 the expert 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 put a small rug 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.450
 we have made more connection 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.310
 with a tube with hector d 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.090
 Kennedy in Florida 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 with some danger 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 we arrived here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890
 It's a series type 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.159
 alley money we have simply connected being a worker pole against 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740
 the drug hand 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.210
 they do not connect 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.329
 stp recited here has a function 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.200
 I think we're going to explain 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780
 after this month 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.980
 spacex zp we have put some small divisions that is nothing more than 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 segments of gutters what has a slot to be able to enter one that knows 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.680
 jet 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.370
 in the three spaces 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.920
 somoza indicate what he achieved 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 on this side 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.440
 we have done it 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.280
 three cars 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 three holes 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.709
 they have media connectors 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.669
 here as here are a pressure in this case 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 Now I'm going to take one so that it can be observed 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.659
 here we have not disarmed this part 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.849
 one of the connectors that is here 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.499
 that sum in the water outlet that will have 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.769
 until it has a connector 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.779
 let's be here 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.389
 and the other 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.579
 it is the counterpart 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.579
 that fit 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.109
 fine plastic so you can enter under pressure 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.779
 and in this way make a tight connection 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.219
 and can not get out of the water 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.649
 on the one hand the program that on the other 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.649
 let's catalog this we connect 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.559
 your success 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.349
 sources 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.829
 they are kidnapped 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.339
 and on the other side, you have to see a shot for what 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.099
 can pressure 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.219
 you twisted here and here 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.589
 there we can say then the main function 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.439
 we have a point 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.059
 we could hold the hose in that income case 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 already but of course inside the pond 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.529
 + read a head of power that is going to absorb the water from the pond and the 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.379
 will take to this area 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.959
 is going to be the income here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.349
 we take out or with some filtering materials what is the function of this 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.599
 transitional stage if the water pressure that enters here if it decreases in 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.749
 this zone 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.989
 and overflow 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.099
 to go through different cameras that we are going to manufacture 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.099
 I take the sheets to criticize that there are cuts 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.679
 pecata minuta reviews cut band fit 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.459
 she affirmed 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.119
 how i said that 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.849
 in this case 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.020
 the headquarters in the channels that are made here and are made with consumption 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.530
 the segment of gutters that I did not need to cut connections from 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 they 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.299
 electric 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 these acrylic that you see here 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.719
 you have to drill in such a way so that the water can pass 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.819
 the first mayor and colomos to drill 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.929
 of the servants of the ugt jesus 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.249
 how we get to almost always so long 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.419
 a saving for less 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.819
 let's not be holes in the 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.899
 come for the growing car market in the high zone 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.789
 in the high part that takes out 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.770
 and is and find out watchmakers in the lower part 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.120
 in this way 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.210
 that the strike is here 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.499
 compression 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.580
 the pressure that overflows in that area 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.960
 goes under 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.290
 no of course camosa filtering material by archaeologists and we are going to 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.409
 remove 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.740
 goes under 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.020
 rises and in this one in this behavior that has so and more filtering material 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.740
 it goes through the upper part 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.699
 in this case separately here 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.659
 low again 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.439
 passes through another but from the bottom Saralegui at the end overflows for that 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.589
 zone 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.439
 Well, we're going to do what it needs to do, in fact, shatter not where the 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.800
 fertilizer school 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 it's not hard at all it's something so simple actually 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.870
 all this is not many but later 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.949
 we need to create 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.799
 hermetic if in the end it will be left without but let's do some 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.229
 if there are small businesses 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.860
 choose or here in those acrylic so that you can redish 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.689
 as well as a cd 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.120
 using to achieve
