00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.999
 and there folks from the blogger and critics from the south and took other processes from you as 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.130
 every game video clips 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.929
 keevill 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.659
 far from it the worst game in the world 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.609
 it's true another snippet she created was pedophile 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.300
 in the game that the olÃ©o in which the lion showed in his blog that it is the consolation 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.929
 brazil games 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.539
 I made this video 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.530
 the path until I regret it but it's to show that there is worse game as soon as 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.290
 you must play 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.290
 to value the games you have 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.580
 let's go to them 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.720
 to start our time here 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.060
 already the track is very common 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.550
 and that last path that if you chose this game translation 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.230
 did not give another 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.580
 The manufacturer was like this for you to see how common 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.450
 and I say it here 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.190
 was the champion the chosen one 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.590
 let's go running 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.220
 to this game was released in 2003 I believe it was released 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.180
 the producer failed 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.420
 Good to start here in a game. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.619
 your opponent lets you go through your plan 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.450
 and in addition the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.400
 take a look at those numbers not 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 I have for him 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.170
 everything wrong 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.860
 as a professional 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.280
 we already talked a lot 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 but this is not the worst believe me if you want 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 bonbon start here 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.650
 go look the best part is pass this bridge d 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 I will carve my car 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.650
 That's why I came back. 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.140
 the well above the mountain 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.120
 I can last course 10th so I'll put bbc 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.840
 d'urso 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.220
 Yes, ma'am, when it's happening, I had to keep going. 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.510
 I entered the city here 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.629
 can pass city 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.999
 sun highway tacks back here 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.249
 Who sends this civil code, can you pass through the city? 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.539
 art seems a bit more 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.859
 is to turn 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.299
 the datafolha of pib the piece treats 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.499
 last year 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.499
 good pastor 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.119
 action - and that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.299
 and now take a look 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.040
 the most money thing or 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 the worst thing in the world is dangerous because list 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.559
 differential bikini 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.219
 there the reason is that taking on the speck in the loft to look 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.429
 I think I'm going to climb her click 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:04.319
 Is it possible to climb good Jorge in this game of look I am 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.439
 if only turned and then bald that literally leave the map 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.379
 afi what to say david bowie hefner 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.869
 on things that did not need to be done 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.199
 each engine did not know if it 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.309
 the motor car 1 0 practically unharmed 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.519
 to 1 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.519
 the professionals 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.749
 So you have an idea of â€‹â€‹how bad it is. 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.119
 defenders may be charged the bill of 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 the worst note that the April liscont 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.439
 very cute 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.209
 practically what 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.609
 the creators tried to do in their balcony queue 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.659
 in public 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.439
 I try 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.439
 goal 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:00.139
 you 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.719
 by these and competitors 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.959
 and can tag wings 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.959
 quality said 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.959
 only that I never caused defeat 30% 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.429
 You can not play, yes, it's ridiculous. 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 Our Lady 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.939
 and also providing when I visit 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.939
 helton I thought so well that a father these 12 deaths 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.189
 it's a fall 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.529
 good, finishing here 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.529
 It's great 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.219
 to the cliff 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.840
 the cliff 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.830
 if you noticed 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 if you walk from one side of the mountain 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.240
 I say this is very 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.020
 I believe in this group 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.770
 I've already passed here 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.199
 the guy 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.460
 start soon 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.460
 they warned me to aim 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.150
 I loved to train and they show you 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.169
 everything is fine, otherwise it will not work 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.439
 and passes one more 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.179
 this is what I wanted to show basically what he hears about what exists 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:41.169
 bad 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.809
 but the advice you give 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.909
 to play I'm not much in favor of piracy but I advise you 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.889
 start the game 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.729
 with falcon 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.520
 value from today after you have seen this video play this game 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.539
 value the games you have 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.669
 eight of them 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.669
 I am much better than residing here 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.280
 the deep commented ric of the time off to value your games saw in there 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.009
 also the continuity 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.009
 the developers stayed to make this game 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:17.180
 have to like 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.050
 none of them remained that when reading here an example eder luis 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.210
 This is me, I'm the sport's idol. 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.210
 and that was a vehicle is touched light 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:53.590
