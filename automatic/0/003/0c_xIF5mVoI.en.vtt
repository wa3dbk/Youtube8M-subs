00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.940
 or the cherubs welcome to the seventh and 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.060
 last chapter of beginners in 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.620
 aquariums titled diseases you 've 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.240
 come here it will be very strange that 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.160
 have problems with your new aquarium 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.670
 let's talk about diseases 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.740
 most common and how to solve the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.630
 more usual is the white dot that is 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.490
 over the body of the fish seems little 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.800
 but inside is killing the animal 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.570
 quickly the easiest thing is to raise the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.280
 temperature and medicate with metro entity 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.710
 sun but beware of prawns 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.750
 separate them and especially with the fish 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.239
 delicate if you use sea green here 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.280
 is another typical disease is the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.860
 hydrops the fish swells and the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.540
 flakes are usually protruding 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.210
 lack of cleanliness in the aquarium 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.829
 this is siphon to two water changes and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.290
 a good filtration avoiding the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.239
 Overpopulation is very difficult for the fish 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.550
 he recovers although he can be fed 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 with vegetable and olive oil eyes 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.480
 opaque as with cotton or substances 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.600
 white by the body of the fish that are 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.250
 fungi are also very common problems 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 we can solve them with anti products 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.959
 fungus or fungus type fungus control 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.590
 my pur and so on by buying them in the 

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.570
 store 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.179
 with statin also called my coast 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.490
 team the intestinal obstruction is another 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:15.710
 usual disease and the fish swells 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 around the stomach area especially and 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.250
 it happens because of the lack of vegetable food 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.890
 added to the intake of food and drinks 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.709
 the solution will be proportional plant 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.539
 every day in spirulina and vegetables 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.759
 boiled mixed with olive oil 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.170
 until you see an improvement and then start 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.390
 to add some other food 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.399
 a few days until the fish 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.799
 recover fully and we can give you a 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.299
 varied diet without missing the plant 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.099
 weak fish that go to the bottom 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.959
 It is also a very common problem 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.090
 caused by poor water conditions 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.590
 and that generally if you can 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.420
 solve with water changes and 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.909
 correct maintenance of the aquarium and the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.709
 filter fray fins a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.539
 more typical problem than you think 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.879
 and that can be caused both by 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.500
 fights as by bacteria we can 

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:59.209
 solve it by treating the fish with a 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.429
 broad antibacterial medicament 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.469
 spectrum in an aquarium or container 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.689
 apart inside the main aquarium to 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.879
 do not kill good lice bacteria 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.349
 anchored to the fish this usually happens in 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.239
 cold waters since the mushrooms and 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.310
 Parasites suffer with temperatures 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.700
 warmer the solution comes to be 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.950
 remove 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.080
 and eye with metronidazole or manually with 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.660
 tweezers and then heal the wound 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.640
 of the fish with betadine or pervinox and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
 return the fish to the aquarium making a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.090
 change water so it does not get infected 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.920
 weak fish that do not grow or that 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.989
 they lose color is something quite common 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.640
 and I think we've all seen it 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.010
 just about all the fish 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 they need a variety of foods and everything 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.610
 kind of varied food that you can 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.790
 buy will be little vegetable flakes 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
 normal flakes lyophilized foods 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.150
 pills and food is a must 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.330
 alive or failing the frozen food 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.489
 the fish block a lot this happens 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.750
 when we have little oxygen 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.299
 overpopulation or lack of changes in 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.700
 water and filtration contain the fish 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.470
 just good filtration a good aerator 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.170
 and make weekly water changes 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.420
 should be enough stressed fish 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 constantly nervous or scary 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.170
 this comes to be by the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.910
 incompatibility between fish or lack 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.549
 of a correct biotope where the fish is 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.860
 feel comfortable and finally another of the 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.110
 diseases or most typical problems in 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.329
 beginners aquariums would be the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.340
 ulcers that can be caused by 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.480
 infections or injuries due to bad 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.360
 water conditions 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.190
 and must be medicated with oxytetracycline 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.019
 also called terramycin and taking the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.480
 fish to apply on the wound betadine or 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.549
 good pervinox we have already finished the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.560
 whole series and I hope that all of these 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.480
 chapters will serve you well not only 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.090
 to start in aquariums but to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.489
 keep them healthy thank you for watching my 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.049
 videos here I leave some more in case 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.349
 you have not seen them or want to go back to 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.349
 see them
