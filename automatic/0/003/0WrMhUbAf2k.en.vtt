00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 the 'holy trinity' ship that is 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.429
 in puerto belgrano and that fought in the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 Falklands war began to sink 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.200
 we want to meet from the minister of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 defense by and cheli how is the ship 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.699
 now it was sinking it holds it 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.930
 can be recovered good night 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.699
 ministers 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 Good evening, a treat in greeting them 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.060
 really the situation has not changed in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.359
 action to the ship of what had been 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.630
 yesterday the ship is that has 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.070
 sitting on the background 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.670
 and let's say it's not now anymore and now the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.890
 armaba thinks to start the tasks of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 recovery in time to do the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.739
 bailing out and putting it afloat again 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.460
 has passed to the minister ship that is the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.610
 million dollar question that is us is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.710
 go see if I'm watching the media 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.430
 especially the chain of discouragement that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.900
 always look for an argument to criticize 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.940
 to our government in particular to 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.600
 our president after her successful 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.979
 tour around Asia but that is to say in this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.130
 what I must say with absolute 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.100
 frankness is that it seems very strange to me 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.259
 that a ship that is deactivated 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.930
 ready for scrapping that has a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.000
 minimum guard may suffer a mishap 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.360
 that leads us to sink in a matter of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.930
 hours then I asked the head of the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.160
 armed that instructs a summary 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.250
 seriously because there seemed to be there 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.530
 there has been a weird hand or if you do not have 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.370
 than to look for an explanation that is 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.410
 coherent and logical 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.230
 to see how a ship made in the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.270
 70s sinking parked in the 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.430
 port and we have for example the corvette 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.470
 sarmiento in puerto madero that has more 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.290
 of 100 years you think there may be 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.110
 some sabotage I do not rule out 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.270
 absolutely nothing and he serves and about 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.520
 all depending on those who use 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.540
 the armed forces to criticism 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.270
 our government and that can by the way 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.120
 since the speech of the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.430
 frigate look for a new element to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.590
 continue to lash out at a government that does not 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
 has no responsibility and in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.000
 particular the president if there is a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.130
 responsibility is the ministry of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.810
 defense and in particular is of the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.710
 men of the army who had their 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.140
 I charge the surveillance of this vessel and 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.940
 they had a minimum guard they are the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.690
 that they would have to make inhabited the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.760
 means to prevent something from happening 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.490
 like the one that is said to have happened that there was 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.410
 a break of a pipe that from 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.989
 which could have flooded the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.500
 ship and that took him to shipwreck in 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.270
 hours I really asked him to do 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.850
 a very good instruction in chief of the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.940
 armed because if we do not have a good 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.090
 is because there is another reality and in that 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.470
 In other words, there must be 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.290
 responsibilities since those who have 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.930
 responsible for the custody of goods and that 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.870
 they do not even meet that minimum 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.620
 that's not it's not possible for a vessel 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.640
 manufactured in the 70 to 40 years 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.650
 is sinking and only by the work of 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.320
 chance and to say that it is missing 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.420
 maintenance that is a ship by the way 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.270
 that was for scrapping since the year 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.890
 2000 but that undoubtedly the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.980
 age of the ship did not merit a 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.330
 think that you can be shipwrecked by the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.850
 just being tied up in the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.910
 independently minister 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.100
 Even what other media say there is 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.650
 a liability or if there is a vessel 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.930
 that sank or is about to sink and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.810
 because if it's not like seeing the faults 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.880
 outside that kids can that's what 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.250
 they want but there is also a 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.190
 responsibility I suppose maintenance 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.100
 or custody that failed 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.130
 Of course, this search is not subject to 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.020
 maintenance because it is to devour 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.420
 consequently no one is made 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.580
 maintenance task to a good that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.220
 you take it over there to save it and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.500
 take it to scrap is to say what yes 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.920
 he had and that is what he has to explain 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.580
 our army is a minimum guard 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.770
 to physically alert about any 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.550
 circumstance in particular because of 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.840
 this vessel and that's what did not meet 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.670
 then she who fits that 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.810
 responsibility that maybe not you eyes 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.140
 there had to be particular to the group of 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.070
 arsenals that is precisely the port 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.870
 belgrano and that he was in charge of 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.700
 surveillance of light that without prejudice to 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.570
 the responsibilities the authorities 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.220
 higher because this undoubtedly the 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.890
 minimum guard should have 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.950
 warned because it is not possible for a 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.290
 vessel of this nature let's say 40 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.110
 Beyond this location, sink 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.550
 deterioration of its material is very rare 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.760
 a 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.470
 It is relatively modern for 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.660
 forests that are in the world sailing 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.340
 with more than 40 years even here in the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.950
 country and I needed as an example the 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.630
 corvette branch that has more than 100 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.020
 granddaughter and Puerto Madero and not 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.630
 sinks alone the sign appears that the other 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.880
 day sank because a pipe or what 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.520
 outside broke and there are penalties 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.560
 planned 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.050
 and I after the instruction of the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.780
 summary that I expect with absolute speed 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.759
 and of period to which the army is 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.319
 make no doubt where the 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:48.539
 responsibility of the invoices that 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.430
 they are in charge of the care without place 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.800
 doubts that there will be sanctions without 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.229
 prejudice and something that I do not rule out that 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.120
 it could be an attack on someone 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.879
 that knowing the circumstance 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.550
 of the shell that has come to open the 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.729
 valve to precisely produce a 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.819
 shipwreck in a matter of hours and just 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.490
 at the right time when in the country 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:14.729
 is our president was 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.860
 culminating a successful one there was a successful 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.720
 tour outside and we appear 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.180
 us with shelves and a trinity that 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.280
 sinks only in the harbor this is what 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.650
 that catches my attention very well 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.000
 arturo puriccelli minister of defense 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.810
 the nation thank you very much for this 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.810
 communication 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.040
 a very particular story of this 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.260
 ship because now 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.040
 is in danger sinking fought in 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.290
 Malvinas and in the year 75 missions 75 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.520
 he suffered a montonero attack and has 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.710
 this story was a summer port 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.700
 incredible good we pause in 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.700
 followed we are with you 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.940
