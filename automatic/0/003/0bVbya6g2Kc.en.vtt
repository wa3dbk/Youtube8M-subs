to hear the location of the speaker
don't<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> hear<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> speaker<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.579> just

in<00:01:06.939> working<00:01:07.840> in<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.049> particular<00:01:08.680> room<00:01:09.329> we

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
in working in this particular room we

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.429 
in working in this particular room we
thought<00:01:10.509> we'd<00:01:10.689> have<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.840> lot<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.140> problem

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
thought we'd have a lot of problem

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.139 
thought we'd have a lot of problem
finding<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.829> location<00:01:12.130> for<00:01:12.460> speakers<00:01:12.820> because

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
finding a location for speakers because

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.260 
finding a location for speakers because
of<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.390> open<00:01:13.719> nature<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.140> all<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.350> glass<00:01:15.270> but

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
of the open nature and all the glass but

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.609 
of the open nature and all the glass but
it<00:01:16.360> turned<00:01:16.539> out<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:16.780> wasn't<00:01:16.990> that<00:01:17.170> big<00:01:17.560> a

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
it turned out that wasn't that big a

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.200 
it turned out that wasn't that big a
problem<00:01:17.890> once<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.369> figured<00:01:18.670> out<00:01:18.789> how<00:01:18.939> to<00:01:19.000> do<00:01:19.149> a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
problem once we figured out how to do a

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.919 
problem once we figured out how to do a
nice<00:01:19.390> clean<00:01:19.420> wiring<00:01:20.350> job<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.700> we<00:01:21.850> chose<00:01:22.119> THX

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
nice clean wiring job so we chose THX

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.190 
nice clean wiring job so we chose THX
certified<00:01:23.350> MK<00:01:23.979> speakers<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:25.299> located<00:01:25.840> two<00:01:26.049> to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
certified MK speakers and located two to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.399 
certified MK speakers and located two to

ear<00:01:31.659> height<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.920> we<00:01:32.950> could<00:01:33.369> get<00:01:33.789> mostly

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299
