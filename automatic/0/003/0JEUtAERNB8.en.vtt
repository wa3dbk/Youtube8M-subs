00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.000
 Welcome dear 1000 ps fans 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.720
 here from the circuit de catalunya in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 barcelona where suzuki his motogp motorcycle 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.700
 for 2015 test 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.600
 so the whole thing has become suzuki 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.060
 2015 again in the motogp circus 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.370
 get in and maybe even 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.710
 this year in valencia we will be at the start 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.210
 a wild card is quite clear that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.940
 not yet one has of course here 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 motogp saw that there were still some 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.220
 seconds behind the clock is suzuki 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.010
 would like to go to yamaha as soon as possible 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.210
 Honda unlock is of course one 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.340
 huge goal 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.200
 at the moment most development is 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.930
 under electronics may not be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.820
 nice to hear but apparently that is 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.890
 mechanics the lesser trouble to have 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.170
 even reveal that you already have too much 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.570
 but he had power in the engine too 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.119
 aggressive has brought a lot of unrest 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.460
 you just have a weaker engine 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.420
 So it should be taken to performance 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.300
 not lacking 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.220
 the big problem next to the three years 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.650
 absence or next 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
 year then four that suzuki has 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.180
 of course from 2016 also the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.100
 he will change then motogp 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.570
 no longer supplied by bridgestone 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.570
 but from whistler 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 By the way, no one was so separate 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.340
 a ducati also test here 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.869
 start in the open class and allowed 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.510
 we develop now 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.420
 the test drivers here are randy de puniet 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.040
 in meier knows and a Japanese 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 Spaceman of us but not 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.970
 it is also known here in barcelona 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.970
 developed with 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.250
 and, as you can hear, suzuki has one too 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.840
 borders get the sound 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.050
 for which always known 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.050
 were
