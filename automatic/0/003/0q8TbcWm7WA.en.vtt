 bid price here is very short and 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.860
 I understand this is recommended to you 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.520
 make a more minimal design then 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.130
 There is less photo not call say 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.220
 hello because maybe orders will be 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.530
 serious guys, but such a welcome 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.750
 really like this very much 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.900
 It takes places for pictures but here 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.950
 said only three things i would 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.450
 advised you to do the following 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.600
 review your site template altogether 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.810
 make a small logo make 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.500
 tab settings direct to the oven yet 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:58.040
 something phone number for example here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.290
 can you put yourself to write something 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.869
 doing wear and positioning yourself 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.959
 as a freelancer and well put a button there 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.369
 order something here in the future 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.640
 you can tell that is on the right 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:20.300
 the tab will have a description of the desired services 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.930
 and it is very important that you can be very big 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.470
 screenshots 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.600
 I would not describe it in detail here 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.660
 would write I would not know too 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.849
 screenshot of the site and would write on it 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.890
 name and main advantages of the type 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.750
 like the camera inside is very comfortable it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.050
 looks and shows that we work a lot 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.690
 very cool advise you to put more 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:47.810
 cases the same on so on the rest 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.370
 boards when there is a creation of landing 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.670
 page 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.620
 in it 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.400
 you show the website talking about them 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.700
 conversion setting direct you write 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.010
 money invested in money and received 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 return on investment and so on cool 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.989
 what are those and certificates 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.550
 not everyone has them and I would advise you 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.920
 make a frame will be more beautiful 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.380
 it looks not just a piece of paper 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.330
 for example, how do I make a certificate for 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.650
 people get their courses like this 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.250
 certificates in frame 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.650
 just draw this frame paste in them 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.819
 your certificate will look much 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.299
 better so so so so twist just 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.220
 it turns out that you're in 1 lonex 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.980
 stuffed about landing and about direct 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.010
 not everyone needs it, it is better to do 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.410
 separate tabs here and do not need so 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:45.769
 many forms you are right everywhere these forms are quiet 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:49.310
 forms forms in general work well for sure 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.880
 she brings you new customers but if 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.080
 you make these edits much 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.010
 cleaner steeper and 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.240
 both better and stronger more that's why 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.990
 logically existing to me 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.510
 merge 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:11.040
 but by design hide things improving 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.280
 and see you on the next sink bye 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.230
