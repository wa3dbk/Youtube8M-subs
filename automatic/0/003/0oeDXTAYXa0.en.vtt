like a kid in a candy store this is a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.890 
like a kid in a candy store this is a
genuine<00:00:19.340> bob<00:00:20.340> voice<00:00:20.609> unit<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.180> back<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.779> his

genuine bob voice unit and back of his

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.689 
genuine bob voice unit and back of his
prius<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.800> could<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.160> his<00:00:23.340> 101<00:00:24.180> so

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
prius you could see his 101 so

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.029 
prius you could see his 101 so
electrolyzer<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> straight

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
electrolyzer and it's this is a straight

colloidal coil in this setup this is
just<00:00:39.719> brute<00:00:40.020> force<00:00:40.320> DC<00:00:41.840> reminded<00:00:42.840> mind<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
just brute force DC reminded mind if I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200 
just brute force DC reminded mind if I
show<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> variac<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.489> i'll<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:45.000> ahead<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
show the variac and i'll go ahead and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.040 
show the variac and i'll go ahead and
embroidered<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> pork<00:00:46.200> okay<00:00:46.590> yeah<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
embroidered on the pork okay yeah so if

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.650 
embroidered on the pork okay yeah so if
you<00:00:49.140> guys<00:00:49.289> check<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> a

you guys check this out can I get it a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.369 
you guys check this out can I get it a
shot<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.590> accurate<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:54.379> there's

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
shot of that very accurate there there's

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.099 
shot of that very accurate there there's
the<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.770> act<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> Bob<00:00:56.370> uses<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> adjust<00:00:57.390> his

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the very act that Bob uses to adjust his

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
the very act that Bob uses to adjust his
voltage<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> fly<00:00:59.280> he<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.789> can<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
voltage on the fly he actually can see a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
voltage on the fly he actually can see a
change<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.870> his<00:01:01.199> miles<00:01:01.440> per<00:01:01.680> gallon<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.190> he's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
change in his miles per gallon as he's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.450 
change in his miles per gallon as he's
driving<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.239> he<00:01:03.270> adjusts<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> variac<00:01:04.890> level

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
driving when he adjusts the variac level

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.170 
driving when he adjusts the variac level

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
trunk amount of battery you guys that's

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.100 
trunk amount of battery you guys that's
an<00:01:59.520> awesome<00:01:59.700> idea<00:02:00.000> water<00:02:00.510> mom<00:02:00.750> here's<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
an awesome idea water mom here's the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
an awesome idea water mom here's the
inverter<00:02:01.470> we've<00:02:02.190> been<00:02:02.310> discussing<00:02:02.670> space

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
inverter we've been discussing space

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
inverter we've been discussing space
savings<00:02:03.810> by<00:02:03.930> putting<00:02:04.229> batteries<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
savings by putting batteries in the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.130 
savings by putting batteries in the
trunk<00:02:05.370> so<00:02:05.580> there<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.940> have<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:08.690> bob<00:02:09.690> says<00:02:09.990> he

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
trunk so there you have it bob says he

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.330 
trunk so there you have it bob says he
has<00:02:10.320> a<00:02:10.350> one<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.160> those<00:02:11.280> infrared<00:02:12.120> thermal

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
has a one of those infrared thermal

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
has a one of those infrared thermal
devices<00:02:14.340> where<00:02:14.640> he<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.910> shoot<00:02:15.060> through<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
devices where he can shoot through the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
devices where he can shoot through the
clear<00:02:16.380> lexan<00:02:16.800> clear<00:02:17.459> acrylic<00:02:17.730> air<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.300> he's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
clear lexan clear acrylic air and he's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.390 
clear lexan clear acrylic air and he's
getting<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.230> plate<00:02:19.470> temperature<00:02:19.680> reading<00:02:20.190> of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
getting a plate temperature reading of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.630 
getting a plate temperature reading of
about<00:02:20.850> 140<00:02:21.630> degrees<00:02:21.660> Fahrenheit<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:23.400> that's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
about 140 degrees Fahrenheit so that's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.330 
about 140 degrees Fahrenheit so that's
about<00:02:23.730> 60<00:02:24.180> degrees<00:02:24.300> Celsius<00:02:24.930> which<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.590> that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
about 60 degrees Celsius which is that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.530 
about 60 degrees Celsius which is that
some<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.730> guys<00:02:26.850> know<00:02:26.910> I've<00:02:27.209> reported

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
some of you guys know I've reported

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
some of you guys know I've reported
that's<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.110> normal<00:02:28.920> operating<00:02:29.400> temperature

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that's the normal operating temperature

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.710 
that's the normal operating temperature
for<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.150> smacking<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> at<00:02:31.019> at<00:02:32.450> 20<00:02:33.450> amps

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
for the smacking it at at 20 amps

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.140 
for the smacking it at at 20 amps
usually<00:02:34.500> hangs<00:02:34.769> around<00:02:34.920> 60<00:02:35.340> degrees<00:02:35.370> Celsius

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
usually hangs around 60 degrees Celsius

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.120 
usually hangs around 60 degrees Celsius
so<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:36.810> kind<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.080> nice<00:02:37.230> verification<00:02:37.890> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
so that's kind of a nice verification of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.970 
so that's kind of a nice verification of
course<00:02:39.090> mine<00:02:39.300> over<00:02:39.989> time<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.440> with<00:02:40.800> higher

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
course mine over time and with higher

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.560 
course mine over time and with higher
amperage<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.670> all<00:02:41.820> know<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.120> runs<00:02:42.330> hotter

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
amperage as you all know it runs hotter

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.960 
amperage as you all know it runs hotter
so<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> way<00:02:43.980> more<00:02:44.250> efficient<00:02:44.700> design

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
so this is a way more efficient design

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.759 
so this is a way more efficient design
runs<00:02:45.209> way<00:02:45.390> cooler<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.110> much<00:02:46.410> longer<00:02:46.440> period

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
runs way cooler for a much longer period

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.509 
runs way cooler for a much longer period

Wow checking checking the unit
now<00:03:12.450> Larry<00:03:12.750> Larry's<00:03:13.439> unit<00:03:13.799> at<00:03:13.950> five<00:03:14.430> amps<00:03:14.909> it

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
now Larry Larry's unit at five amps it

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.910 
now Larry Larry's unit at five amps it
appears<00:03:15.659> as<00:03:15.810> though<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.110> running<00:03:16.439> anywhere

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
appears as though it's running anywhere

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.559 
appears as though it's running anywhere
from<00:03:17.099> two<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.370> three<00:03:17.489> liters<00:03:17.849> per<00:03:18.120> minute<00:03:18.239> so

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
from two to three liters per minute so

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.750 
from two to three liters per minute so
there<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.409> an<00:03:19.560> obvious<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.159> additional

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
there is an obvious the additional

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.429 
there is an obvious the additional
plates<00:03:21.000> probably<00:03:21.480> has<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.629> lot<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.079> with<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
plates probably has a lot to do with the
