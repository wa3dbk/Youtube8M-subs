hi<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.920> Jimmy<00:00:05.190> Chang<00:00:05.220> we're<00:00:05.580> here<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> talk

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
hi I'm Jimmy Chang we're here to talk

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.369 
hi I'm Jimmy Chang we're here to talk
about<00:00:05.940> how<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> create<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> magic<00:00:06.990> square<00:00:07.140> with

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
about how to create a magic square with

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.560 
about how to create a magic square with
negative<00:00:07.799> numbers<00:00:08.099> now<00:00:08.820> usually<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.300> create

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
negative numbers now usually you create

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.839 
negative numbers now usually you create
magic<00:00:09.870> squares<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.500> positive<00:00:11.040> numbers<00:00:11.610> but

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
magic squares with positive numbers but

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.520 
magic squares with positive numbers but
you<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.420> also<00:00:12.599> create<00:00:12.870> magic<00:00:13.139> squares<00:00:13.380> with

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
you can also create magic squares with

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.870 
you can also create magic squares with
negative<00:00:13.860> numbers<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.309> long<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.730> follow

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
negative numbers as long as you follow

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.730 
negative numbers as long as you follow
the<00:00:15.120> same<00:00:15.299> methodology<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.470> do<00:00:16.560> with

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the same methodology as you do with

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.920 
the same methodology as you do with
positive<00:00:17.190> numbers<00:00:17.490> now<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.480> demonstration

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
positive numbers now the demonstration

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540 
positive numbers now the demonstration
we're<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> use<00:00:19.260> today<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
we're going to use today is that of the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.950 
we're going to use today is that of the
staircase<00:00:20.910> method<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> method

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
staircase method which is a method

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.890 
staircase method which is a method
guaranteed<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.070> develop<00:00:23.490> odd<00:00:24.000> order<00:00:24.539> magic

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
guaranteed to develop odd order magic

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.769 
guaranteed to develop odd order magic

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
set cetera so first and foremost we're

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.959 
set cetera so first and foremost we're
going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.689> draw<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:34.280> nine<00:00:35.280> by<00:00:35.730> nine<00:00:37.399> array<00:00:38.399> first

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
going to draw a nine by nine array first

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.819 
going to draw a nine by nine array first
and<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.110> familiar<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.559> them<00:00:40.710> at

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and if you are familiar with them at

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.010 
and if you are familiar with them at
staircase<00:00:41.579> method<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.899> should<00:00:42.989> be

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
staircase method then this should be

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.240 
staircase method then this should be
easy<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.350> follow<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.800> you're<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
easy to follow but if you're not this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549 
easy to follow but if you're not this
might<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> adjustment<00:00:45.559> but

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
might be a little bit of adjustment but

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
might be a little bit of adjustment but
you<00:00:47.010> should<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.520> able<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> pick<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.000> pretty

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you should be able to pick it up pretty

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
you should be able to pick it up pretty
soon<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> foremost<00:00:50.969> we're<00:00:51.059> going

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
soon now first and foremost we're going

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.160 
soon now first and foremost we're going
to<00:00:51.239> start<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.870> negative

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to start off with the first negative

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.240 
to start off with the first negative
number<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> which<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
number that we think of which is

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
number that we think of which is
negative<00:00:53.579> 1<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> first<00:00:54.420> number<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
negative 1 and the first number is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.360 
negative 1 and the first number is
always<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> center<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
always going to be at the center of the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160 
always going to be at the center of the
top<00:00:56.579> row<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:58.140> here

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
top row so it's going to be over here

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.290 
top row so it's going to be over here
now<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> general<00:00:59.399> pattern<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> staircase

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
now the general pattern of the staircase

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.090 
now the general pattern of the staircase
method<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.809> you're<00:01:01.079> moving<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.620> an<00:01:01.829> upward

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.190 

pattern<00:01:05.100> left<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.840> diagonal

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
pattern left to right in a diagonal

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.410 
pattern left to right in a diagonal
fashion<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.150> some

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
fashion so with there's going to be some

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.219 
fashion so with there's going to be some
rules<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.650> consider<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.430> let's<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:13.110> they

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
rules to consider so let's see what they

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
rules to consider so let's see what they
are<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:13.979> you're<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.310> negative

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
are now if you're going from negative

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.859 
are now if you're going from negative
one<00:01:14.880> you're<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.240> over<00:01:15.509> here

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
one you're going to be over here

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.020 
one you're going to be over here
vertically<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.590> outside<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.490> square<00:01:17.670> now

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
vertically you're outside the square now

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.100 
vertically you're outside the square now
when<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.270> happens<00:01:18.659> you're<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> drop

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
when that happens you're going to drop

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
when that happens you're going to drop
all<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> bottom<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
all the way down to the bottom of the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
all the way down to the bottom of the
row<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> next<00:01:22.680> number<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.100> be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
row and put the next number there so be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.120 
row and put the next number there so be
negative<00:01:23.670> two<00:01:23.880> now<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:24.990> moving<00:01:25.799> here

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
negative two now when you're moving here

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
negative two now when you're moving here
to<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.420> outside<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.320> square

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
to here you're outside the square

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
to here you're outside the square
horizontally<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
horizontally so you're going to the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
horizontally so you're going to the
beginning<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.750> row<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.430> you're<00:01:32.430> going

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
beginning of this row and you're going

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.920 
beginning of this row and you're going
to<00:01:32.579> write<00:01:32.759> negative<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:33.570> here

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to write negative three over here

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.460 
to write negative three over here
now<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.020> are

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
now if you go from here to here you are

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.580 
now if you go from here to here you are
going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.720> be<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> situation<00:01:40.350> where<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
going to be in a situation where the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
going to be in a situation where the
numbers<00:01:40.950> already<00:01:41.159> occupied<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.909> whenever

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
numbers already occupied so whenever

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
numbers already occupied so whenever
that<00:01:42.270> happens<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.170> drop<00:01:43.439> down<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that happens you drop down one so this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.880 
that happens you drop down one so this
will<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.729> negative<00:01:44.909> four<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.590> should<00:01:46.860> be

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
will be negative four now this should be

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
will be negative four now this should be
smooth<00:01:47.579> sailing<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> next<00:01:48.299> couple<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
smooth sailing for the next couple of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
smooth sailing for the next couple of
entries<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> here

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
entries because go from here to here

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.280 
entries because go from here to here
there's<00:01:50.939> an<00:01:51.149> empty<00:01:51.450> number<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> have

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
there's an empty number so you have

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.200 
there's an empty number so you have
negative<00:01:52.649> five<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.060> it's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
negative five from here to here it's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.830 
negative five from here to here it's
going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> negative<00:01:54.689> six<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:56.600> when<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
going to be negative six now when you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.310 
going to be negative six now when you
are<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> very<00:01:58.469> top<00:01:59.600> right-hand<00:02:00.600> corner<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
are at the very top right-hand corner of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.789 
are at the very top right-hand corner of
a<00:02:01.530> square<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> an<00:02:02.880> odd<00:02:03.030> order<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.960> drop<00:02:04.320> down

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
a square and an odd order you drop down

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
a square and an odd order you drop down
one<00:02:05.399> notch<00:02:05.700> that'll<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.180> negative<00:02:06.719> seven<00:02:08.509> now

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
one notch that'll be negative seven now

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.540 
one notch that'll be negative seven now
from<00:02:10.379> here<00:02:10.709> you're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
from here you're going to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.430 
from here you're going to
go<00:02:13.210> diagonally<00:02:13.870> over<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.350> again

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
go diagonally over here but again

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.230 
go diagonally over here but again
horizontally<00:02:15.280> you're<00:02:15.400> outside<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.060> square

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
horizontally you're outside the square

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.210 
horizontally you're outside the square
so<00:02:16.810> you're<00:02:16.930> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> go<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> beginning

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
so you're going to go to the beginning

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
so you're going to go to the beginning
of<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.430> row<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.820> that's<00:02:18.880> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.150> be

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
of that row and that's going to be

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.540 
of that row and that's going to be
negative<00:02:19.600> eight<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.990> lastly<00:02:20.650> if<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.340> move

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
negative eight and lastly if you move

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.370 
negative eight and lastly if you move
here<00:02:22.000> you're<00:02:22.450> going<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.780> be<00:02:22.930> vertically

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
here you're going to be vertically

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.720 
here you're going to be vertically
outside<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.860> square<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.280> you're<00:02:24.400> dropping

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
outside the square so you're dropping

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.830 
outside the square so you're dropping
down<00:02:24.760> that'll<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.480> negative<00:02:25.720> nine<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:27.840> what

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
down that'll be negative nine now what

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.490 
down that'll be negative nine now what
you<00:02:28.960> can<00:02:29.140> do<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:29.620> own<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.980> verify<00:02:30.790> that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you can do on your own is verify that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.550 
you can do on your own is verify that
the<00:02:32.500> sum<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.830> each<00:02:33.250> row<00:02:33.630> column<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.050> diagonal

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the sum of each row column and diagonal

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.140 
the sum of each row column and diagonal
is<00:02:35.830> going<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> give<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.430> same<00:02:36.670> sum

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
is going to give you the same sum

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.090 
is going to give you the same sum
because<00:02:37.960> that's<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> magic<00:02:38.620> square<00:02:38.830> does

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
because that's what a magic square does

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.050 
because that's what a magic square does
now<00:02:39.700> as<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.210> probably<00:02:40.270> tell<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.640> sum<00:02:43.030> of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
now as you can probably tell the sum of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.940 
now as you can probably tell the sum of
every<00:02:43.630> row<00:02:43.780> column<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.320> diagonal<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.800> going

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
every row column and diagonal is going

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.740 
every row column and diagonal is going
to<00:02:45.010> give<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.460> sum<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.670> negative<00:02:45.940> 15<00:02:46.240> which

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
to give you the sum of negative 15 which

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.410 
to give you the sum of negative 15 which
verifies<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.680> magic<00:02:48.190> square<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.030> you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
verifies that it's a magic square so you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.030 
verifies that it's a magic square so you
can<00:02:49.570> create<00:02:49.840> your<00:02:49.960> own<00:02:50.260> magic<00:02:50.530> squares<00:02:50.890> with

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
can create your own magic squares with

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.440 
can create your own magic squares with
negative<00:02:51.370> numbers<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.090> need<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.300> follow

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
negative numbers you just need to follow

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.350 
negative numbers you just need to follow
the<00:02:52.840> proper<00:02:53.110> strategies<00:02:53.800> going<00:02:54.280> forward<00:02:54.400> so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the proper strategies going forward so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.120 
the proper strategies going forward so
I'm<00:02:55.660> Jimmy<00:02:55.840> Chang<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.440> how<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.770> create

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
I'm Jimmy Chang and that's how to create

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.760 
I'm Jimmy Chang and that's how to create
a<00:02:57.160> magic<00:02:57.490> square<00:02:57.640> with<00:02:57.850> negative<00:02:58.240> numbers
