you'll have 12 audio bites here let's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.140 
you'll have 12 audio bites here let's
just<00:02:19.590> pick<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> couple<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.280> them<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.940> click

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
just pick a couple of them and you click

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:34.089 
just pick a couple of them and you click
on<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> numbers<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.959> 1<00:02:22.200> 2<00:02:22.380> &amp;<00:02:22.530> 3<00:02:22.560> &amp;

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.610 

so<00:02:34.969> you<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.299> idea<00:02:35.329> once<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.170> click<00:02:36.379> on<00:02:36.499> an

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
so you get the idea once you click on an

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.520 
so you get the idea once you click on an
occupy<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:37.430> plays<00:02:37.640> back<00:02:37.879> in<00:02:38.120> time<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:39.230> tab

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
occupy it plays back in time the tab

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.349 
occupy it plays back in time the tab
appears<00:02:39.950> below<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.579> when<00:02:40.790> you're<00:02:40.969> you<00:02:41.329> know

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
appears below so when you're you know

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.759 
appears below so when you're you know
trying<00:02:41.719> to<00:02:41.780> figure<00:02:42.049> out<00:02:42.109> what's<00:02:42.379> going<00:02:42.650> on

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
trying to figure out what's going on

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.110 
trying to figure out what's going on
here<00:02:42.829> you<00:02:43.310> quickly<00:02:43.909> put<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.269> tab<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:46.120> because

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
here you quickly put the tab and because

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.860 
here you quickly put the tab and because
this<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.359> not<00:02:47.659> like<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.609> meeting<00:02:49.629> program<00:02:50.629> that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
this is not like a meeting program that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.240 
this is not like a meeting program that
just<00:02:51.019> plays<00:02:51.260> back<00:02:51.530> tab<00:02:51.859> with<00:02:52.129> no

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
just plays back tab with no

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.759 
just plays back tab with no
interpretation<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:54.079> great<00:02:54.530> tool

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
interpretation this is great tool

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.610 
interpretation this is great tool
because<00:02:55.219> it's<00:02:55.760> played<00:02:56.090> by<00:02:56.120> person<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.019> even

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
because it's played by person and even

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.099 
because it's played by person and even
though<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:58.040> played<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:59.239> time<00:02:59.659> and<00:03:00.019> is

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
though they played in time and is

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.890 
though they played in time and is
mechanically<00:03:00.819> accurately<00:03:01.819> as<00:03:01.939> possible<00:03:01.969> it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
mechanically accurately as possible it

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.890 
mechanically accurately as possible it
still<00:03:03.260> sounds<00:03:03.829> like<00:03:03.889> a<00:03:04.069> person<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.819> real<00:03:05.450> person

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
still sounds like a person a real person

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.929 
still sounds like a person a real person
