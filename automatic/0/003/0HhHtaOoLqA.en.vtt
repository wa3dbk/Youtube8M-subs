00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.340 
again I mean since by entirely about a
year<00:03:36.190> ago<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:37.030> amount<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.450> sunsets<00:03:38.020> that<00:03:38.140> I've

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
year ago the amount of sunsets that I've

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.540 
year ago the amount of sunsets that I've
seen<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:39.310> just<00:03:39.780> absolutely<00:03:40.780> untold<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.620> once

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
seen is just absolutely untold and once

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.070 
seen is just absolutely untold and once
again<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.060> say<00:03:43.300> being<00:03:43.570> able<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.900> walk

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
again like I say being able to walk

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.199 
again like I say being able to walk
around<00:03:44.290> in<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.680> random<00:03:45.190> places<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:45.940> I

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
around in just random places like this I

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.240 
around in just random places like this I
mean<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.990> different<00:03:47.320> place<00:03:47.500> every<00:03:47.530> day<00:03:47.890> if<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
mean a different place every day if you

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.510 
mean a different place every day if you
are<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.700> minded<00:03:49.180> no<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:49.990> think<00:03:50.560> will<00:03:50.770> do<00:03:50.950> if<00:03:51.280> I

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
are so minded no I think will do if I

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.390 
are so minded no I think will do if I
can<00:03:51.730> figure<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.390> out<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.959> finding<00:03:53.890> away<00:03:54.100> down

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
can figure it out is finding away down

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.040 
can figure it out is finding away down
there<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.240> can<00:03:55.390> have<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.540> look<00:03:55.660> at<00:03:55.780> hilly

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
there so we can have a look at hilly

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.650 
there so we can have a look at hilly
from<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.470> side<00:03:56.820> know<00:03:57.820> what<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:58.209> don't<00:03:58.450> want

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
from the side know what we don't want

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.020 
from the side know what we don't want
here<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.320> fall<00:03:59.709> over<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.220> end<00:04:00.670> after<00:04:00.820> all

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
here is to fall over and end after all

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.250 
here is to fall over and end after all
in<00:04:01.240> all<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> way<00:04:01.600> down<00:04:01.840> into<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.200> canal<00:04:04.260> there

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
in all the way down into the canal there

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.670 
in all the way down into the canal there
is<00:04:05.590> no<00:04:06.550> I'm<00:04:06.790> not<00:04:06.970> gonna<00:04:07.120> try<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.810> go<00:04:08.050> any<00:04:08.350> closer

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
canal I know this has been just the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.430 
canal I know this has been just the
video<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.370> me<00:04:21.549> generally<00:04:22.240> saying<00:04:22.510> unrelated
