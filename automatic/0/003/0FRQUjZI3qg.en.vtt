00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.220 
on my own household I've cut down on
waste<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.610> we've<00:02:12.390> obviously<00:02:12.510> saved<00:02:12.960> a<00:02:13.050> lot<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
waste and we've obviously saved a lot of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.100 
waste and we've obviously saved a lot of
money<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.800> we've<00:02:14.250> also<00:02:14.720> put<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> lot<00:02:15.990> these

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
money that we've also put a lot these

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.020 
money that we've also put a lot these
chemicals<00:02:16.590> out<00:02:16.770> into<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.160> environment<00:02:17.280> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
chemicals out into the environment and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.240 
chemicals out into the environment and
we're<00:02:18.300> living<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.630> lot<00:02:18.810> healthier<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.530> I

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
we're living a lot healthier and I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.680 
we're living a lot healthier and I
decided<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> good<00:02:21.210> idea<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
decided that it would be a good idea to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.050 
decided that it would be a good idea to
transfer<00:02:22.410> those<00:02:22.710> positive<00:02:23.250> environmental

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
transfer those positive environmental

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 
transfer those positive environmental
benefits<00:02:24.600> across<00:02:24.900> onto<00:02:25.290> my<00:02:25.410> farming<00:02:25.800> business

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
benefits across onto my farming business

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.980 
benefits across onto my farming business
and<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.940> made<00:02:27.210> me<00:02:27.330> much<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.540> aware<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
and that's made me much more aware of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.590 
and that's made me much more aware of
sustainable<00:02:28.590> farming<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.940> what<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> really

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
sustainable farming so what I really

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.790 
sustainable farming so what I really
need<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> look<00:02:31.380> at<00:02:31.470> my<00:02:31.590> sheer

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
need to do is have a look at my sheer

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.880 
need to do is have a look at my sheer
milking<00:02:32.070> business<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.620> it's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
milking business and just see that it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.680

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
which just for example on my farm the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.810 
which just for example on my farm the
effluent<00:05:02.590> wasn't<00:05:03.220> working<00:05:03.460> all<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.760> well

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
effluent wasn't working all that well

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.790 
effluent wasn't working all that well
and<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.630> managed<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.080> get<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.350> effluent

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
and I managed to get the effluent

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.140 
and I managed to get the effluent
irrigator<00:05:06.130> serviced<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.389> plus<00:05:07.630> I've<00:05:07.810> changed

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
irrigator serviced and plus I've changed

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.360

changed<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.560> settings<00:05:11.560> from<00:05:11.890> hits<00:05:12.160> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
changed the settings from hits and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.159 
changed the settings from hits and
fillings<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:12.669> cam<00:05:13.030> locks<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.630> now<00:05:14.020> I've

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
fillings to cam locks and now I've

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.990 
fillings to cam locks and now I've
actually<00:05:14.440> extended<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:15.310> influent<00:05:15.850> from

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
actually extended that influent from

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.960 
actually extended that influent from
five<00:05:16.360> hit<00:05:16.570> DS<00:05:16.750> 2<00:05:16.960> 12<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.220> good<00:05:18.729> simple

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
five hit DS 2 12 and it's a good simple

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.430 
five hit DS 2 12 and it's a good simple
system<00:05:19.419> that<00:05:19.570> works<00:05:19.780> really<00:05:19.960> well<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.350> I'm

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
system that works really well and I'm

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.529 
system that works really well and I'm
proud<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.100> so<00:05:21.880> that's<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.300> small

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
proud of it and so that's just a small

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:23.940 
proud of it and so that's just a small
example<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:23.020> something<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.320> can<00:05:23.470> actually<00:05:23.770> do

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
example of something you can actually do

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.730 
example of something you can actually do
yourself<00:05:24.340> that's<00:05:24.580> very<00:05:24.820> proactive<00:05:25.620> what<00:05:26.620> I've

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740
