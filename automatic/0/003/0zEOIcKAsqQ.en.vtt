00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and sometimes the thing that's lacking

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.429 
and sometimes the thing that's lacking
is<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.500> little<00:01:16.920> extra<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> protein<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
is that little extra bit of protein and

adding something like p28 into into that

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.120 
adding something like p28 into into that
pretty<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:24.299> eliminates<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.950> issue

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
pretty much eliminates that little issue

you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.660> also<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.290> I'm<00:02:20.770> not<00:02:20.920> really<00:02:21.099> sure<00:02:21.370> if

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you can also see I'm not really sure if

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.430 
you can also see I'm not really sure if
you<00:02:21.550> can<00:02:21.730> see<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.480> separation<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.440> almond

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
you can see the separation of the almond

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.759 
you can see the separation of the almond
butter<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.390> basically<00:02:29.050> there's<00:02:29.290> separation

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
butter and basically there's separation

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.550 
butter and basically there's separation
you<00:02:30.069> have<00:02:30.310> if<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:31.239> something<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.290> really

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
you have if if something is really

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.009 
you have if if something is really
natural<00:02:33.060> you'll<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.239> almond<00:02:34.599> butter<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
natural you'll have almond butter and

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.150 
natural you'll have almond butter and
then<00:02:35.430> you'll<00:02:36.430> have<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.880> oil<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.269> top<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.160> it'll

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
then you'll have the oil on top so it'll

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.330 
then you'll have the oil on top so it'll
separate<00:02:39.760> obviously<00:02:40.420> within<00:02:40.750> butter<00:02:41.470> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
separate obviously within butter and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.130 
separate obviously within butter and
then<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.760> mix<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.209> together<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
then you just mix that together and it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:54.630 
then you just mix that together and it
becomes<00:02:44.260> delicious<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.280> awesome<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:53.640> and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
becomes delicious and awesome and so and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.089 
becomes delicious and awesome and so and
so<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.209> good<00:02:55.480> either<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.769> spoon

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
so this is good either just on a spoon

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.930 
so this is good either just on a spoon
look<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.299> or<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.799> can<00:03:00.340> throw<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.670> into<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
look so or you can throw it into a

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.150 
look so or you can throw it into a
blender<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.440> do<00:03:02.560> whatever<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:03.040> normally

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
blender you can do whatever you normally

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.289 
blender you can do whatever you normally
do<00:03:03.459> with<00:03:03.580> almond<00:03:03.880> butter

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
do with almond butter

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
do with almond butter
the<00:03:04.810> difference<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:06.670> tastes<00:03:07.180> awesome

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the difference is this tastes awesome

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.610 
the difference is this tastes awesome
it's<00:03:09.310> got<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.610> added<00:03:09.910> protein<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:11.290> really

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it's got the added protein and it really

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.020 
it's got the added protein and it really
isn't<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.069> much<00:03:12.190> more<00:03:12.489> expensive<00:03:12.760> than

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
isn't that much more expensive than

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.720 
isn't that much more expensive than
normal<00:03:13.420> almond<00:03:14.170> butter<00:03:14.430> probably<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.459> dollar

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
normal almond butter probably a dollar

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.250 
normal almond butter probably a dollar
more<00:03:16.329> or<00:03:16.450> something<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:16.810> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
more or something like that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.099 
more or something like that
two<00:03:18.100> dollars<00:03:18.459> depending<00:03:19.359> on<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.810> kind<00:03:20.049> of

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
two dollars depending on the kind of

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.470 
two dollars depending on the kind of
almond<00:03:20.410> butter<00:03:20.440> you're<00:03:20.769> buying<00:03:20.980> now<00:03:21.609> when<00:03:22.450> I

almond butter you're buying now when I

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720 
almond butter you're buying now when I
first<00:03:22.720> tried<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.380> almond<00:03:23.769> butter<00:03:23.950> it

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
first tried this almond butter it

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.360 
first tried this almond butter it
actually<00:03:25.180> came<00:03:25.450> as<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.810> crunchy<00:03:26.590> almond<00:03:27.220> butter

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

actually came as a crunchy almond butter
and<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:29.109> liked<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.530> one<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.769> lot

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
and I actually liked that one a lot

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.330 
and I actually liked that one a lot
better<00:03:30.340> but<00:03:31.209> apparently<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.890> meet<00:03:33.130> all

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
better but apparently to meet all

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.840

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
guidelines and to have a consistent

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.080 
guidelines and to have a consistent

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
texture they made it a smooth one I'm

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.849 
texture they made it a smooth one I'm
not<00:03:40.299> saying<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.109> bad<00:03:41.380> one<00:03:41.560> it's

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
not saying that this is a bad one it's

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.050

it up some lemon butter with some whey

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.190 
it up some lemon butter with some whey
protein<00:04:08.889> try<00:04:09.880> doing<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.389> it's<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:10.840> not

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
protein try doing that it's just not

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960 
protein try doing that it's just not
gonna<00:04:11.410> be<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.739> same<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.250> texture<00:04:12.819> the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
gonna be the same the texture the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.520 
gonna be the same the texture the
consistency<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:13.930> won't<00:04:14.170> be<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.500> same

inside
it's<00:04:23.240> mixed<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.750> just<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.440> don't<00:04:24.500> know<00:04:24.650> they

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
it's mixed in just I don't know they

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.730 
it's mixed in just I don't know they
figured<00:04:25.130> out<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.400> formula<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:27.050> know<00:04:27.170> this<00:04:27.620> is

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
figured out the formula you know this is
