transition<00:02:51.740> moves<00:02:53.050> then<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.140> top<00:02:54.380> left<00:02:54.650> hand

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
transition moves then a top left hand

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.060

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.879 

I<00:04:15.630> think<00:04:16.630> it's<00:04:16.750> like<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.930> four<00:04:17.199> star<00:04:17.410> problem

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
I think it's like a four star problem

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.890 
I think it's like a four star problem
like<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.310> definitely<00:04:18.570> one<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.690> most

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
like it's definitely one of the most

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.509 
like it's definitely one of the most
unique<00:04:20.199> problems<00:04:20.739> I've<00:04:20.919> done<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> Front

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
unique problems I've done on the Front
