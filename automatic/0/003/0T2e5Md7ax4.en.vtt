00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
bursts and that's pretty much it all I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.679 
bursts and that's pretty much it all I
can<00:01:31.560> say<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.790> skull<00:01:33.060> masher<00:01:33.509> which

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
can say is that the skull masher which

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
can say is that the skull masher which
is<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> next<00:01:34.409> sniper<00:01:34.770> rifle<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
is the next sniper rifle I'm going to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.030 
is the next sniper rifle I'm going to
talk<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.509> pretty<00:01:36.810> much<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.170> superior

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
talk about is pretty much a superior

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
talk about is pretty much a superior
version<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> invader<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.600> invader

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
version of the invader the invader

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.609 
version of the invader the invader
consumes<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.829> ammo<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> fire<00:01:43.350> rate

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
consumes a lot of ammo and the fire rate

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.429 
consumes a lot of ammo and the fire rate
is<00:01:43.799> low<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.729> believe<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.689> skull<00:01:45.930> masher

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
is low and it I believe the skull masher

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.880 
is low and it I believe the skull masher
has<00:01:46.829> more<00:01:47.430> damage<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> anyway<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
has more damage so anyway just to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.120 
has more damage so anyway just to
demonstrate<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.670> guys

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
demonstrate you guys
