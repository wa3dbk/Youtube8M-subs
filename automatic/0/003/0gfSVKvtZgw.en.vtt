00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
with a balloon this games just like that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
with a balloon this games just like that
only<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.150> fewer<00:00:27.420> balloons<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.109> less<00:00:28.470> mud

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

and<00:00:29.580> no<00:00:29.760> musical<00:00:30.330> numbers<00:00:30.630> yeah<00:00:30.960> there's<00:00:31.439> no

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and no musical numbers yeah there's no

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
and no musical numbers yeah there's no
reason<00:00:32.009> these<00:00:32.130> bees<00:00:32.460> couldn't<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.910> singing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
reason these bees couldn't be singing

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
reason these bees couldn't be singing
something<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:33.930> sure<00:00:34.170> they're<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.590> than

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
something I'm sure they're more than

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
something I'm sure they're more than
capable<00:00:35.180> although<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.239> never<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.780> tell<00:00:36.960> with

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
capable although you never can tell with

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.569 
capable although you never can tell with
bees<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.469> bear<00:00:40.489> for<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
very first iphone game and although you

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.160 
very first iphone game and although you
can<00:00:54.580> certainly<00:00:54.760> tell<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.330> some<00:00:55.510> respects<00:00:55.960> it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
can certainly tell in some respects it's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.870 
can certainly tell in some respects it's
actually<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.770> really<00:00:56.950> fun<00:00:57.250> idea<00:00:57.430> that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
actually a really fun idea that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.290 
actually a really fun idea that
absolutely<00:00:58.510> has<00:00:58.660> its<00:00:58.990> moments<00:00:59.310> so<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:00.730> game<00:01:00.910> 4

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
absolutely has its moments so the game 4

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.540 
absolutely has its moments so the game 4
goes<00:01:01.330> all<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.900> usual<00:01:02.500> video<00:01:02.830> game<00:01:03.100> battles

in the forests for decades perhaps even
longer<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:15.130> being<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.460> struggle<00:01:16.000> between

that's<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.020> bees<00:01:20.380> work<00:01:20.770> diligently<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.670> their

that's the bees work diligently on their
honey<00:01:22.240> it's<00:01:22.750> your<00:01:22.840> job<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.260> protect<00:01:23.590> them<00:01:23.979> from

honey it's your job to protect them from
the<00:01:24.340> Bears<00:01:24.610> see<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.270> Bears<00:01:25.510> swing<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.110> on

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
the Bears see the Bears swing in on

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.990 
the Bears see the Bears swing in on
ropes<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.830> reach<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.250> honey<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.790> have<00:01:27.880> to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
ropes to reach the honey so you have to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.210 
ropes to reach the honey so you have to
cut<00:01:28.180> them<00:01:28.390> down<00:01:28.420> by<00:01:28.900> swiping<00:01:29.170> your<00:01:29.350> finger<00:01:29.470> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
cut them down by swiping your finger the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.490 
cut them down by swiping your finger the
thing<00:01:30.460> is<00:01:30.490> your<00:01:30.880> bees<00:01:31.210> evidently<00:01:32.080> spend<00:01:32.380> all

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
thing is your bees evidently spend all

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.080 
thing is your bees evidently spend all
their<00:01:32.619> energy<00:01:33.040> on<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.280> honey<00:01:33.460> making<00:01:33.940> and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
their energy on the honey making and

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.600 
their energy on the honey making and
therefore<00:01:34.750> can't<00:01:35.050> fly<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.950> they<00:01:36.100> have<00:01:36.310> ropes

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
therefore can't fly so they have ropes

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.870 
therefore can't fly so they have ropes
too<00:01:36.940> if<00:01:37.300> you<00:01:37.420> cut<00:01:37.600> down<00:01:37.630> too<00:01:37.990> many<00:01:38.170> bees<00:01:38.880> tut

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
too if you cut down too many bees tut

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:56.130 
too if you cut down too many bees tut
tut<00:01:39.910> looks<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:40.810> death

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.860 

there<00:01:56.979> are<00:01:57.100> ten<00:01:57.340> levels<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:58.000> each<00:01:58.300> one<00:01:58.570> turns

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
there are ten levels and each one turns

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.440 
there are ten levels and each one turns
into<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.290> insane<00:02:00.159> entanglement<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.180> ropes

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
into this insane entanglement of ropes

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.020 
into this insane entanglement of ropes
and<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:01.930> certainly<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.380> cool<00:02:02.680> idea<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.460> there

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and it's certainly a cool idea and there

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.609 
and it's certainly a cool idea and there
are<00:02:04.120> even<00:02:04.150> power-ups<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.080> appear<00:02:05.440> in<00:02:05.470> the

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
are even power-ups that appear in the

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.340 
are even power-ups that appear in the
hive<00:02:05.800> but<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.610> concept<00:02:07.180> does<00:02:07.720> stumble<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.319> bit

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
hive but the concept does stumble a bit

hive but the concept does stumble a bit
at<00:02:08.860> times<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:09.490> virtually<00:02:10.119> impossible<00:02:10.209> to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
at times it's virtually impossible to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.199 
at times it's virtually impossible to
slice<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> bear's<00:02:11.740> rope<00:02:12.069> without<00:02:12.459> also<00:02:12.820> cutting

down<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.750> your<00:02:13.900> bees<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.680> sucks<00:02:15.100> when<00:02:15.310> that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
down one of your bees it sucks when that

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.540 
down one of your bees it sucks when that
happens<00:02:16.290> another<00:02:17.290> issue<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.620> had<00:02:17.860> was<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.280> you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
happens another issue I had was that you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.430 
happens another issue I had was that you
know<00:02:18.790> you'll<00:02:19.209> see<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> bear<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.170> quickly

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
know you'll see a bear and you quickly

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440 
know you'll see a bear and you quickly
cut<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.920> rope<00:02:21.130> down<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.850> as<00:02:22.030> you're<00:02:22.270> doing

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
cut the rope down but as you're doing

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.110 
cut the rope down but as you're doing
that<00:02:22.630> Abby<00:02:23.410> comes<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:23.980> from<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> exact<00:02:24.820> same

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
that Abby comes in from the exact same

place so you're killing a bee that you
didn't<00:02:27.489> even<00:02:27.550> see<00:02:27.790> coming<00:02:28.209> sometimes<00:02:28.660> which

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
didn't even see coming sometimes which

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320 
didn't even see coming sometimes which
is<00:02:29.560> kind<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.890> inevitable<00:02:30.100> given<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.820> concept

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
is kind of inevitable given the concept

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.350 
is kind of inevitable given the concept
but<00:02:32.020> still<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.860> an<00:02:33.010> enjoyably<00:02:33.550> frantic<00:02:34.120> game

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
but still it's an enjoyably frantic game

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.330 
but still it's an enjoyably frantic game

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
and when it does click it could be a lot

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520 
and when it does click it could be a lot
of<00:02:36.489> fun<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:37.060> game<00:02:37.269> could<00:02:37.480> definitely<00:02:37.930> be<00:02:38.290> more

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
of fun the game could definitely be more

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.550 
of fun the game could definitely be more
polished<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.400> refined<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:40.420> as<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.290> be

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
polished and refined but as it is to be
