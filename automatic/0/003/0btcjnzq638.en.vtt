00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
believe it or not the move you're about

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.780 
believe it or not the move you're about
to<00:00:06.720> learn<00:00:06.899> which<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.500> loop<00:00:07.710> isn't<00:00:08.460> any

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
to learn which is the loop isn't any

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.070 
to learn which is the loop isn't any
harder<00:00:09.179> than<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> moves<00:00:09.630> you've<00:00:09.840> just

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
harder than the moves you've just

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.390 
harder than the moves you've just
learned<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.469> split<00:00:10.769> wheels<00:00:10.950> or<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
learned the split wheels or the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.089 
learned the split wheels or the
cartwheel<00:00:11.790> moves<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.929> uses<00:00:13.349> skills<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.980> you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
cartwheel moves it uses skills that you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
cartwheel moves it uses skills that you
probably<00:00:14.549> already<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:15.410> if<00:00:16.410> you've<00:00:16.590> ever

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
probably already have if you've ever

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.950 
probably already have if you've ever
done<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.949> front<00:00:17.279> flip<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.510> already<00:00:18.690> do

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
done a front flip and you can already do

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.370 
done a front flip and you can already do
a<00:00:18.990> loop<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.699> here's<00:00:20.880> how<00:00:21.029> we'll<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> step

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
a loop so here's how we'll do it step

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.990 
a loop so here's how we'll do it step
one<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.830> need<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> hole<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.609> deep<00:00:23.880> enough

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
one is we need a hole that's deep enough

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
one is we need a hole that's deep enough
that<00:00:24.359> you're<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> hit<00:00:24.990> bottom<00:00:25.350> or

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that you're not going to hit bottom or

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
that you're not going to hit bottom or
if<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.430> hit<00:00:26.670> bottom<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.150> barely<00:00:27.390> tagged

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
if you do hit bottom you barely tagged

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.720 
if you do hit bottom you barely tagged
the<00:00:27.990> bottom<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.920> hit<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> bottom<00:00:29.490> really

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the bottom if you hit the bottom really

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.999 
the bottom if you hit the bottom really
easily<00:00:30.210> when<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.599> plug<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> front<00:00:31.830> end

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
easily when you plug in for a front end

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
easily when you plug in for a front end
or<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> root<00:00:32.430> endo<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> work

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
or a root endo it's not going to work

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.590 
or a root endo it's not going to work
very<00:00:34.290> well<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> loop<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.300> key

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
very well for the loop so the first key

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
very well for the loop so the first key
to<00:00:36.840> doing<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.200> loop<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.590> finding<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> proper<00:00:38.430> hole

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to doing a loop is finding a proper hole

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.780 
to doing a loop is finding a proper hole
can<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> heavily<00:00:39.899> breaking<00:00:40.320> wave<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.640> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
can be a heavily breaking wave or it can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.529 
can be a heavily breaking wave or it can
be<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> full-on<00:00:42.390> hole<00:00:43.520> holes<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.879> puffier

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
be a full-on hole holes that are puffier

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.619 
be a full-on hole holes that are puffier
taller<00:00:46.140> versus<00:00:46.890> poor<00:00:47.160> overs<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:48.059> easier<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
taller versus poor overs are easier to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
taller versus poor overs are easier to
loop<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.770> reason<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.370> more

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
loop in and the reason is because more

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.479 
loop in and the reason is because more
water<00:00:51.329> goes<00:00:52.140> down<00:00:52.500> into<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> hole<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.370> then

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
water goes down into the hole and then

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
water goes down into the hole and then
shoots<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.420> inset<00:00:54.989> upwards<00:00:55.500> shooting

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
shoots up and inset upwards shooting

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
shoots up and inset upwards shooting
water<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.730> help<00:00:56.940> shoot<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
water that can help shoot you up to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
water that can help shoot you up to
assist<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> loop<00:00:59.300> now<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.539> found<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
assist with the loop now that we found a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.470 
assist with the loop now that we found a
good<00:01:01.020> hole<00:01:01.199> let's<00:01:01.680> loop<00:01:02.030> ferry<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.390> the

top of the hole to your all the way on
the<00:01:05.280> top<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:06.140> your<00:01:07.140> about<00:01:07.350> hits<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> green

the top as your about hits the green

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
the top as your about hits the green
water<00:01:08.729> you're<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.119> stand<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.200> foot

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
water you're gonna stand up on your foot

water you're gonna stand up on your foot
braces<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.820> bowels<00:01:12.180> gonna<00:01:12.390> plug<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
braces now your bowels gonna plug in and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340 
braces now your bowels gonna plug in and
it's<00:01:14.610> gonna<00:01:14.729> start<00:01:15.090> rising<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.140> bit

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it's gonna start rising up a little bit

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.249 
it's gonna start rising up a little bit
as<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.950> starts<00:01:17.310> rising<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> moment

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
as it starts rising up that's the moment

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
as it starts rising up that's the moment
you're<00:01:19.530> gonna<00:01:19.650> lean<00:01:20.280> forward<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.790> hard<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you're gonna lean forward as hard as you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
you're gonna lean forward as hard as you
can<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> tuck<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.470> soon<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> stern

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can and tuck as soon as the stern

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.490 
can and tuck as soon as the stern
catches<00:01:23.759> you're<00:01:24.450> gonna<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:24.960> leaning<00:01:25.380> on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
catches you're gonna go from leaning on

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
catches you're gonna go from leaning on
your<00:01:25.619> front<00:01:26.250> spray<00:01:26.640> skirt<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.720> leaning<00:01:28.140> your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
your front spray skirt to leaning your

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.340 
your front spray skirt to leaning your
body<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.100> way<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.729> deck

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
body all the way on the back deck

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.420 
body all the way on the back deck
essentially<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.500> you're<00:01:31.590> doing<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.009> opening

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
essentially what you're doing is opening

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
essentially what you're doing is opening
up<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> pair<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> scissors<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.229> throwing

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
up a pair of scissors or you're throwing

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.310 
up a pair of scissors or you're throwing
the<00:01:34.890> bow<00:01:35.040> down<00:01:35.369> by<00:01:36.299> throwing<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.869> body<00:01:37.079> back

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the bow down by throwing your body back

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
the bow down by throwing your body back
again<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.220> every<00:01:38.520> action<00:01:38.700> there's<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.060> equal

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
again for every action there's an equal

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
again for every action there's an equal
and<00:01:39.329> opposite<00:01:39.689> reaction<00:01:40.220> that's<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.460> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and opposite reaction that's how you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.270 
and opposite reaction that's how you
finish<00:01:41.939> off<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> loop<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> technique<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
finish off the loop the technique that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
finish off the loop the technique that
we're<00:01:44.549> learning<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.240> done<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.860> gonna

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we're learning if done right is gonna

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
we're learning if done right is gonna
pop<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> water<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.630> before<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
pop you out of the water and before you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.130 
pop you out of the water and before you
know<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> you'll<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.740> air<00:01:50.040> looping<00:01:51.049> there's<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
know it you'll be air looping there's a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
know it you'll be air looping there's a
few<00:01:52.320> common<00:01:52.710> mistakes<00:01:53.100> people<00:01:53.189> will<00:01:53.549> make

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
few common mistakes people will make

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.730 
few common mistakes people will make
when<00:01:53.970> learning<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.360> loop<00:01:54.540> number<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.560> they

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
when learning to loop number one they

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.289 
when learning to loop number one they
try<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> learn<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> spot<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:57.119> isn't

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
try to learn in a spot that just isn't

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
try to learn in a spot that just isn't
deep<00:01:57.630> enough<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.649> happens<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.280> bow

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
deep enough so what happens is your bow

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
deep enough so what happens is your bow
hits<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> bottom<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.360> stops<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.930> your

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
hits the bottom and stops all your

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.050 
hits the bottom and stops all your
rotation<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> prevents<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.759> from<00:02:02.850> being

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
rotation and prevents you from being

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.230 
rotation and prevents you from being
able<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> loop<00:02:03.600> over<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.869> top<00:02:04.790> another<00:02:05.790> common

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
able to loop over the top another common

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.440 
able to loop over the top another common
mistake<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.229> keeping<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> boat<00:02:07.920> straight

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
mistake is not keeping the boat straight

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.330 
mistake is not keeping the boat straight
when<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.629> drive<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.890> need<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> not<00:02:11.310> only

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
when you drive in you need to not only

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640 
when you drive in you need to not only
keep<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> boat<00:02:12.330> pointing<00:02:12.780> straight<00:02:13.140> up

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
keep the boat pointing straight up

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.009 
keep the boat pointing straight up
the<00:02:13.920> current<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.090> also<00:02:15.299> need<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.780> keep

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
the current but you also need to keep

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.990 
the current but you also need to keep
from<00:02:16.650> leaning<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.129> boat<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.549> left<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.909> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
from leaning the boat to the left or the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.280 
from leaning the boat to the left or the
right<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.269> need<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> keep<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.780> boat<00:02:18.959> dead

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
right you need to keep the boat dead

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.369 
right you need to keep the boat dead
flat<00:02:19.650> by<00:02:20.459> doing<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.540> bow<00:02:21.810> goes<00:02:22.110> in

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
flat by doing that your bow goes in

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.830 
flat by doing that your bow goes in
straight<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:22.980> your<00:02:23.730> boat<00:02:23.909> pops<00:02:24.239> up<00:02:24.510> straight

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
straight and your boat pops up straight

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.770 
straight and your boat pops up straight
which<00:02:25.079> allows<00:02:25.409> you<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> loop<00:02:25.890> over<00:02:26.220> straight

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
which allows you to loop over straight

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.199 
which allows you to loop over straight
another<00:02:27.780> common<00:02:28.170> mistake<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.799> when<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.549> you

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
another common mistake is when you you

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.660 
another common mistake is when you you
you're<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.629> high<00:02:30.870> you've<00:02:31.260> tucked<00:02:31.620> your<00:02:32.310> stern

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
you're up high you've tucked your stern

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.839 
you're up high you've tucked your stern
hits<00:02:33.439> instead<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.650> opening<00:02:35.129> up<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.519> pushing

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
hits instead of opening up and pushing

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.940 
hits instead of opening up and pushing
your<00:02:35.970> feet<00:02:36.209> down<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:37.140> flatten<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> boat<00:02:37.769> out

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
your feet down to flatten the boat out

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.490 
your feet down to flatten the boat out
to<00:02:38.159> finish<00:02:38.430> your<00:02:38.609> loop<00:02:39.109> another<00:02:40.109> common

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
to finish your loop another common

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.670 
to finish your loop another common
mistake<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.069> keep<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.640> body<00:02:41.879> tucked<00:02:42.269> up

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
mistake is to keep your body tucked up

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.750 
mistake is to keep your body tucked up
no<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.799> reason<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.250> doesn't<00:02:44.430> work<00:02:44.730> very

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
no the reason that doesn't work very

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.449 
no the reason that doesn't work very
well<00:02:45.060> unless<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.659> do<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.079> high<00:02:46.379> loop<00:02:46.650> is

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
well unless you do a really high loop is

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.430 
well unless you do a really high loop is
because<00:02:47.909> your<00:02:48.120> body<00:02:48.389> weight<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.260> bow

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
because your body weight is on the bow

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.920 
because your body weight is on the bow
your<00:02:49.980> your<00:02:50.310> face<00:02:50.549> is<00:02:50.819> up<00:02:50.970> by<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.180> spray<00:02:51.629> skirt

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
your your face is up by the spray skirt

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.289 
your your face is up by the spray skirt
and<00:02:52.230> your<00:02:52.799> body<00:02:52.980> weights<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.579> bow<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.180> when

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
and your body weights on the bow so when

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.170 
and your body weights on the bow so when
the<00:02:54.420> water<00:02:54.599> hits<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.079> stern<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:56.430> has<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.909> lift

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the water hits the stern it has to lift

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.539 
the water hits the stern it has to lift
all<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.989> body<00:02:58.230> weight<00:02:58.560> up<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.129> over<00:02:59.400> in

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
all your body weight up and over in

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.300 
all your body weight up and over in
order<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.909> finish<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.389> loop<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.920> make<00:03:02.159> it

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
order to finish the loop you can make it

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.009 
order to finish the loop you can make it
a<00:03:02.370> lot<00:03:02.549> easier<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> water<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.750> finish

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
a lot easier for the water to finish

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.949 
a lot easier for the water to finish
your<00:03:04.200> loop<00:03:04.349> by<00:03:05.159> leaning<00:03:05.519> back<00:03:05.750> there's<00:03:06.750> one

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
your loop by leaning back there's one

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.229 
your loop by leaning back there's one
more<00:03:07.139> thing<00:03:07.439> you<00:03:07.560> can<00:03:07.739> do<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.549> help<00:03:08.730> eek<00:03:09.000> out

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
more thing you can do to help eek out

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.349 
more thing you can do to help eek out
loops<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.099> do<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.639> loop<00:03:11.879> stroke

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
loops and that is to do the loop stroke

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.960 
loops and that is to do the loop stroke
the<00:03:13.200> loop<00:03:13.379> stroke<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:13.950> essentially<00:03:14.549> at<00:03:14.819> that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
the loop stroke is essentially at that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.550 
the loop stroke is essentially at that
last<00:03:15.269> moment<00:03:15.569> when<00:03:15.900> you're<00:03:16.079> going<00:03:16.260> from

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
last moment when you're going from

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.819 
last moment when you're going from
tucked<00:03:17.069> leaning<00:03:17.790> forward<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.750> opening<00:03:19.680> up

tucked leaning forward to opening up
leaning<00:03:20.250> back<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.730> finish<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.180> off<00:03:21.329> instead<00:03:22.230> it

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
leaning back to finish it off instead it

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.559 
leaning back to finish it off instead it
is<00:03:22.440> leaning<00:03:22.829> back<00:03:23.040> take<00:03:23.849> your<00:03:23.879> right<00:03:24.239> blade

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
is leaning back take your right blade

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.550 
is leaning back take your right blade
from<00:03:25.560> your<00:03:26.069> bow<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.699> sweep<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.750> straight<00:03:28.230> over

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
from your bow and sweep it straight over

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.069 
from your bow and sweep it straight over
your<00:03:28.709> head<00:03:28.919> all<00:03:29.159> the<00:03:29.519> way<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.909> stern<00:03:30.239> what

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
your head all the way to the stern what

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.619 
your head all the way to the stern what
that<00:03:31.260> helps<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:32.159> pull<00:03:32.699> the<00:03:32.849> bow<00:03:32.970> down<00:03:33.299> and

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
that helps is to pull the bow down and
