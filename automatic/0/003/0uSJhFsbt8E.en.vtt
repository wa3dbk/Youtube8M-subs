LED<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:30.750> paneling<00:02:31.750> also<00:02:32.049> is<00:02:32.170> entirely<00:02:32.530> glossy

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
LED and paneling also is entirely glossy

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.800 
LED and paneling also is entirely glossy
so<00:02:34.630> there's<00:02:34.840> no<00:02:35.019> difference<00:02:35.170> basically<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
so there's no difference basically the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.440 
so there's no difference basically the
hinges<00:02:38.110> sit<00:02:38.290> upright<00:02:38.590> they<00:02:39.310> are<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.579> sitting

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
hinges sit upright they are not sitting

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.289 
hinges sit upright they are not sitting
inside<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:41.790> looks<00:02:42.790> bigger<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:44.100> laptop<00:02:45.299> when

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
inside so looks bigger a laptop when

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.430 
inside so looks bigger a laptop when
compared<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> once<00:02:47.049> those<00:02:47.320> sit<00:02:47.680> inside<00:02:49.440> okay

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
compared to once those sit inside okay

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.569 
compared to once those sit inside okay
