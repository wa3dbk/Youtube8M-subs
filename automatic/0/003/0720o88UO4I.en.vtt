00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.889
 every musician regardless of 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.990
 instrument that you practice must be able 

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:10.750
 of building chords on a piano 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.080
 keyboard to understand the music that 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.180
 interprets this collection of exercises 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.579
 is intended as preparation in the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.880
 execution of chords and subsequently the 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.159
 accompaniment of melodies remember 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.970
 that the major tonic day scale is 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:30.849
 formed by five tones and two semitones 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.149
 We start with note 2 located at 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.739
 left of two black keys 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.989
 located the gift of the next octave 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.050
 we observe that this octave interval 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:46.120
 contains two semitones the one located between 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.690
 the notes my ifa and the notes if gone in 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.879
 the picture 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.280
 we have colored these notes so that 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.579
 you see more easily try to visualize 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.589
 the now without coloring half tone of my 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.409
 eagerness and half tone of yes to do we build 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.740
 the eighth of re a re and we observe that 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.680
 it also contains the two semitones 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.610
 the octave interval of miami also 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.759
 contains them the same happens from fa fa and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.310
 from sun to sun they both contain 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.430
 semitones existing between the notes my 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.520
 fa and the notes been 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.840
 to build the octaves of the wing and of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.090
 if we repeat the same situation 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 we can conclude by saying that all 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.060
 octaves contain the two semitones 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.119
 that is the eighth on the day scale 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.969
 Major tonic contains five tones and two 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.789
 semitonos why the authors have 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.459
 determined to call them fair because 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.510
 they are all the same 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:57.150
 remember the octaves are just 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.430
 this observation is important that 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.410
 another side is evident so that later 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.080
 we can understand the construction of 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.680
 the fifths the fourth and the rest of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.679
 intervals 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.539
 let's see it now on the keyboard 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.640
 endeavoring to visualize the semitones 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.640
 without the help of colored images 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.830
 2nd 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.830
 re re 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.220
 me me 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.380
 fa fa 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.050
 Sun Sun 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.210
 continue with the rest of the notes until 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 that you visualize perfectly the octaves 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.490
 recognizing the situation of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.490
 semitones
