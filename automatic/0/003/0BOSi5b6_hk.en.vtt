00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 Y 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.520
 hello I am darth games and welcome to 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.920
 this week's chapter we're going to do 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.959
 a very father routine then we're going to 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.720
 start and do not forget to always warm up 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.610
 6 5 or 10 minutes before starting this 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.500
 routine can be done at home with 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.790
 anything you have there that you can 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.800
 use as weights 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.560
 me for using this water jug 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.540
 but you can also use one of milk what 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 they have there no longer with water until 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.219
 which is a weight that you like we are going to 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.940
 start with the first exercise starts 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.840
 down here we are going to lift the weight and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.000
 take care to return it to the center and turn 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.610
 return it help what is important here is 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.280
 when you're going to grab it, we're not going to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.829
 bend at the waist if we're not going to do 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.370
 a squat to lift and turn 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.250
 again the squat and turn is 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.649
 advance 10 times to the side this second 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.800
 exercise let's also do with the 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.990
 Garraf Aug with the weight you bring or without 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.899
 weight depending on the level then what 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.060
 we put on the shoulder let's take a step 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.960
 back as a rude with a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.760
 kick 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.150
 that requires a bit of balance 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.690
 then you have to do it with a lot 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.450
 careful or equal if you have something to 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.030
 grab where you can stay stable 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.980
 It is also very good then what 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.730
 we do here 20 times we change sides 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.909
 and with the other foot 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.450
 one 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.450
 two 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.560
 4 to 20 we go to the lizards 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 the issue is that you are well straight as 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.759
 a table none of this none of this well 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.539
 a straight we bend the elbows up and 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.060
 down now they seem a little easier 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.740
 spatially and by saying to your knees 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.619
 And that is not like that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.810
 Freud that in itself some good that you can 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:15.330
 make them more rather challenges here 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.330
 low also with knee to elbow 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.120
 one 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.460
 two 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.950
 3 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.590
 then to your 15 to 20 lizards 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.080
 depending on utility and we go with the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.900
 last exercise just grab your 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.710
 garrafÃ³n you hold them by your chest 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.550
 you do some in theory 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.430
 you make a full turn and again towards 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.730
 the other direction and another squat 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.380
 working both your legs and glutes and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.380
 also the shoulders and arms 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.110
 with these four exercises form is the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.200
 routine they do once they rest a 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.450
 little bit 234 five times and you can 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.909
 do with your endurance and we see the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.209
 next week so you look like a 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.209
