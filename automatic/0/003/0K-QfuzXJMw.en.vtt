creates<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.680> unique<00:00:49.220> set<00:00:49.699> of<00:00:49.730> challenges<00:00:49.850> for

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
creates a unique set of challenges for

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.470 
creates a unique set of challenges for
this<00:00:51.079> fuel<00:00:51.379> pump<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:52.550> is<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.879> fuel<00:00:53.120> pump<00:00:53.329> in

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
this fuel pump this is the fuel pump in

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.329 
this fuel pump this is the fuel pump in
the<00:00:53.600> sender<00:00:53.989> out<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:54.769> particular

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
the sender out of this particular

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.509 
the sender out of this particular
vehicle<00:00:55.579> as<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.629> can<00:00:56.809> see<00:00:57.110> it's<00:00:57.860> got<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.100> 90

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
vehicle as you can see it's got a 90

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.540 
vehicle as you can see it's got a 90
degree<00:00:58.850> bend<00:00:59.150> in<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.480> because<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:01.010> tank<00:01:01.339> is

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
degree bend in it because the tank is

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.299 
degree bend in it because the tank is
vertical<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.600> pump<00:01:02.870> will<00:01:03.500> go<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.070> tank

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
vertical so the pump will go in the tank

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.060 
vertical so the pump will go in the tank
and<00:01:04.640> go<00:01:05.089> down<00:01:05.360> like<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.649> it<00:01:06.770> will<00:01:06.890> be

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
and go down like this and it will be

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.190 
and go down like this and it will be
bolted<00:01:07.310> at<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.790> top<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.539> can<00:01:08.600> see<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.020> new

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
bolted at the top you can see the new

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.680 
bolted at the top you can see the new
one<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.410> we<00:01:09.649> have<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:10.009> right<00:01:10.280> there<00:01:10.690> since

the captured captured nut the strap on

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.559 
the captured captured nut the strap on
and<00:02:23.420> then<00:02:23.840> what<00:02:24.319> they<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.940> run<00:02:26.120> the

and then what they do is they run the
nut<00:02:26.780> all<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.140> way<00:02:27.260> up<00:02:27.379> until<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.010> bill<00:02:28.670> tank

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
nut all the way up until the bill tank

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.710 
nut all the way up until the bill tank
is<00:02:29.060> tight<00:02:29.300> like<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:31.160> one<00:02:32.060> thing<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.569> they

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
is tight like so but one thing that they

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.230 
is tight like so but one thing that they
do<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.230> tell<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.069> from<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.610> factory

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.080 

they<00:02:42.240> are<00:02:44.990> they<00:02:45.990> are<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.380> long<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.310> what

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
they are they are this long and what

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.660 
they are they are this long and what
they<00:02:48.240> do<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.780> whenever<00:02:49.320> they<00:02:49.530> run<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.400> up

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
they do is whenever they run this up

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.690 
they do is whenever they run this up
into<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.240> capture<00:02:51.630> nut

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
into the capture nut

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.310 
into the capture nut
since<00:02:53.700> these<00:02:53.910> straps<00:02:54.240> are<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.720> long<00:02:54.990> and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
since these straps are so long and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.420 
since these straps are so long and
they're<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.040> tight<00:02:56.280> against<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.820> tank

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
they're so tight against the tank

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.220 
they're so tight against the tank
they'll<00:02:59.430> run<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.880> stud<00:03:00.300> up<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.630> there<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
they'll run that stud up in there and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.470 
they'll run that stud up in there and
they'll<00:03:01.380> screw<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.580> then<00:03:02.880> they<00:03:03.090> put

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
they'll screw it in and then they put

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.890 
they'll screw it in and then they put
their<00:03:03.660> knot<00:03:04.460> on<00:03:05.460> and<00:03:06.270> they<00:03:06.390> run<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.690> all<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
their knot on and they run it all the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.180 
their knot on and they run it all the
way<00:03:07.110> until<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.620> tight

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
way until it's tight

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.580 
way until it's tight
then<00:03:08.910> after<00:03:09.360> they<00:03:09.570> get<00:03:09.780> done<00:03:10.020> running<00:03:10.470> it

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
then after they get done running it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.900 
then after they get done running it
until<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.040> tight<00:03:11.960> as<00:03:12.960> you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.380> see<00:03:13.910> right

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
until it's tight as you can see right

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.780 
until it's tight as you can see right
here<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.870> threads<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.950> little<00:03:17.340> cutaway

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
here in the threads is a little cutaway

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.110 
here in the threads is a little cutaway
they<00:03:18.570> do<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:19.140> they'll<00:03:19.410> take<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.850> long<00:03:20.850> piece

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
they do is they'll take that long piece

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.020 
they do is they'll take that long piece
of<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.390> stud<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.870> break<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.530> off<00:03:22.710> so<00:03:23.700> what

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
of the stud and break it off so what

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.970 
of the stud and break it off so what
that<00:03:24.180> does<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.930> makes<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.440> stud<00:03:25.770> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
that does is it makes this stud a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.090 
that does is it makes this stud a
one-time<00:03:26.520> use<00:03:26.760> only<00:03:27.440> because<00:03:28.440> whenever<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
one-time use only because whenever you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.700 
one-time use only because whenever you
remove<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.730> strap<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.570> releases<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.290> tension

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
remove the strap it releases the tension

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.900 
remove the strap it releases the tension
and<00:03:31.890> then<00:03:33.020> it<00:03:34.020> becomes<00:03:34.440> too<00:03:35.340> short

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
and then it becomes too short

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.240 
and then it becomes too short
it'll<00:03:36.660> only<00:03:36.810> stick<00:03:37.170> out<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.560> far<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.190> you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it'll only stick out that far and you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.530 
it'll only stick out that far and you

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
can't get any threads on it what you

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.360 
can't get any threads on it what you
need<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.530> need<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.800> go<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.070> your
