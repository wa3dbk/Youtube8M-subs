incredible the other difference in the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.090 
incredible the other difference in the
bike<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.470> 320<00:01:15.470> kilos<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.310> rocket<00:01:16.580> 3<00:01:17.590> 358<00:01:18.590> kilos

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100

the<00:01:19.640> rocket<00:01:19.970> 3<00:01:20.180> touring<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.260> much

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
the rocket 3 touring so it's a much

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.560 
the rocket 3 touring so it's a much
heavier<00:01:21.920> machine<00:01:22.280> as<00:01:22.640> well<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.060> that's<00:01:23.330> dry

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
heavier machine as well and that's dry

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.510 
heavier machine as well and that's dry
weight<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.290> once<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.530> stick<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.770> full<00:01:24.979> full

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520
