00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it's there this could be quite useful

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.260 
it's there this could be quite useful
for<00:01:30.299> multiplayer<00:01:30.659> servers<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:32.270> quite

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
for multiplayer servers and I quite

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
for multiplayer servers and I quite
enjoy<00:01:33.479> using<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.049> houses<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.590> other

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
enjoy using it in my houses so the other

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.050 
enjoy using it in my houses so the other
type<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> block<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.729> slightly

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
type of block which is slightly

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.950 
type of block which is slightly
different<00:01:39.329> from<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.780> normal<00:01:40.110> 5<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:42.299> light

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
different from the normal 5 as the light

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.679 
different from the normal 5 as the light
sensor<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.860> we'll<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.790> fact<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.299> good

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
sensor so we'll just in fact a good

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.440 
sensor so we'll just in fact a good
place<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> put<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> probably<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:48.270> turn

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
place to put it probably here just turn

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.789 
place to put it probably here just turn
create<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> modern<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.530> show<00:01:49.740> you

pass<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.420> point<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:13.159> deactivate<00:02:14.870> so

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
pass this point that will deactivate so

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.520 
pass this point that will deactivate so
if<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.769> minimum<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.250> 12<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:19.110> goes<00:02:19.290> below

was created with the forced orden for a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.259 
was created with the forced orden for a
redstone<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.950> button<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.849> middle<00:03:11.970> that

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
redstone and button in the middle that

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.559 
redstone and button in the middle that
will<00:03:13.049> create<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> secret<00:03:13.650> button<00:03:13.829> block<00:03:14.569> can

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
will create the secret button block can

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.569 
will create the secret button block can
we<00:03:15.660> activate<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.169> from<00:03:16.260> all<00:03:16.530> six<00:03:16.829> sides<00:03:17.069> as<00:03:17.400> far

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
we activate it from all six sides as far

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.520 
we activate it from all six sides as far
as<00:03:17.669> I'm<00:03:17.790> moyer<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.989> you've<00:03:19.169> got<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> head

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
as I'm moyer then you've got the head

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.479 
as I'm moyer then you've got the head
and<00:03:19.680> lever<00:03:19.829> works<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.209> normal<00:03:21.389> lever

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
and lever works just like a normal lever

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.860 
and lever works just like a normal lever
again<00:03:23.489> can<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.760> activated<00:03:24.180> from<00:03:24.419> all<00:03:24.599> sides

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
again can be activated from all sides

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.789 
again can be activated from all sides
and<00:03:26.299> that's<00:03:27.299> created<00:03:27.690> with<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.079> four<00:03:28.500> stone

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
and that's created with the four stone

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.960 
and that's created with the four stone
for<00:03:29.609> redstone<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.660> weaver<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.109> middle

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
for redstone and a weaver in the middle

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.720 
for redstone and a weaver in the middle
next<00:03:33.840> we're<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> light<00:03:34.830> sensor<00:03:35.340> I'll

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
next we're on to the light sensor I'll

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.900 
next we're on to the light sensor I'll
show<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.060> working<00:03:36.480> here<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:36.990> that<00:03:37.200> with<00:03:37.800> a

show you working here with that with a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.350 
show you working here with that with a
an<00:03:38.910> iron<00:03:39.390> door<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:40.260> we<00:03:40.380> go<00:03:40.500> tonight<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:42.090> shuts

an iron door so we go tonight it shuts
we<00:03:43.110> got<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> daylight<00:03:43.710> now<00:03:44.400> open<00:03:44.520> sorry<00:03:44.910> about

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
we got to daylight now open sorry about

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.400 
we got to daylight now open sorry about
all<00:03:45.120> these<00:03:45.300> world<00:03:45.510> tools<00:03:45.840> i<00:03:45.990> think<00:03:46.170> i<00:03:46.230> need<00:03:46.380> to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
all these world tools i think i need to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.980 
all these world tools i think i need to
start<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:46.860> what<00:03:47.010> mods<00:03:47.250> i'm<00:03:47.400> running<00:03:47.990> anyway

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.760 
start it what mods i'm running anyway
the<00:03:49.830> idea<00:03:50.420> behind<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.960> for<00:03:52.500> stone

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
the idea behind this one is for stone

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.340 
the idea behind this one is for stone
for<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> redstone<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.750> torch<00:03:54.990> in<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.230> center

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
for a redstone and a torch in the center

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.920 
for a redstone and a torch in the center
next<00:03:58.350> rom<00:03:58.710> to<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> wood<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.340> pressure<00:03:59.550> plate

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
next rom to the wood and pressure plate

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
next rom to the wood and pressure plate
acts<00:04:00.930> just<00:04:01.110> like<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.380> normal<00:04:01.530> wind<00:04:01.860> and

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
acts just like a normal wind and
