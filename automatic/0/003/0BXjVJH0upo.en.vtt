there<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.110> our<00:01:15.740> old<00:01:16.740> master<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> way

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
there we go our old master out the way

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
there we go our old master out the way
that's<00:01:18.330> ready<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.930> feed<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> new<00:01:19.979> job<00:01:20.220> into<00:01:20.580> it

this<00:01:28.409> printer<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.729> print<00:01:29.990> now<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.170> no

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
this printer can print now there's no

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.460 
this printer can print now there's no
disposable<00:01:32.100> gloves<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.119> child<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:34.290> was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
disposable gloves here but child it was

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.920 
disposable gloves here but child it was
in<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:39.750> has

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
in the way so just there now this has

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.990 
in the way so just there now this has
got<00:01:40.110> three<00:01:40.409> modes<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.130> text<00:01:41.759> mode

pictures come out a little bit grainy on

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.480 
pictures come out a little bit grainy on
here<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.829> pendulum<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.310> these

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
here but it's pendulum in these

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
see how close to the edge the printer

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
see how close to the edge the printer
can<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> copy<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.469> let's<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.100> ahead<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
can make the copy so let's go ahead and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.490 
can make the copy so let's go ahead and
make<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> master<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.090> position<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.270> sheet

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
make the master if I position this sheet

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.290 
make the master if I position this sheet
here<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.700> beep<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:13.290> draw<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.800> in

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
here and go beep and then draw it in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.180 
here and go beep and then draw it in
this<00:02:15.300> light<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.620> start<00:02:16.950> button

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
this light here for the start button

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.510 
this light here for the start button
then<00:02:17.430> turns<00:02:17.760> green<00:02:18.120> push<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:20.130> start

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
then turns green push that I now start

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.270 
then turns green push that I now start
making<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.970> monster<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.530> draw<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.920> sheet

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
making a monster so we draw that sheet

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.360 
making a monster so we draw that sheet
into<00:02:23.580> here<00:02:24.000> where<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.110> new<00:02:25.260> molds<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.710> wrap<00:02:26.160> it

that's the very first sheet from the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.560 
that's the very first sheet from the
drum<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.560> can<00:02:44.800> see<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.370> goes<00:02:45.520> pretty<00:02:46.330> much

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
ahead and do a print run so let's types

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:18.070 
ahead and do a print run so let's types
a<00:03:07.240> tenon<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.590> set<00:03:08.830> 90<00:03:09.310> pages<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.700> minute

so I'll type of hundreds in let's set it

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.270 
so I'll type of hundreds in let's set it
at<00:03:31.470> full<00:03:31.650> speed

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
