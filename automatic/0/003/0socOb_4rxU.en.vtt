it's<00:01:36.760> easy<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.180> do<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.460> don't<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.910> be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
it's easy to do it you don't have to be

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.219 
it's easy to do it you don't have to be
at<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.180> track<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.510> have<00:01:40.630> your<00:01:40.750> bets<00:01:40.900> anymore

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
it's probably more convenient to do it

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.670 
it's probably more convenient to do it
in<00:01:42.790> front<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.060> your<00:01:43.180> TV<00:01:43.510> at<00:01:43.630> home<00:01:43.840> or<00:01:44.170> while

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
you're watching the race and so there's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.910 
you're watching the race and so there's
been<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> shift<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.110> people<00:01:47.380> betting<00:01:47.560> online

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
and to be people betting not on course

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.350 
and to be people betting not on course
but<00:01:50.770> it's<00:01:51.460> still<00:01:51.640> fun<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.850> go<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.180> races
