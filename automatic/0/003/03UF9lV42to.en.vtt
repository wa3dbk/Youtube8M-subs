00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 protein is the most popular supplement on 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.120
 mass 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.990
 there are a lot of myths around him 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:20.010
 delusions in this lesson I will dispel everything 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 these protein myths are the perfect product 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 for building muscle mass but 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 some newcomers are mistaken and think 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 that protein is harmful and make up oneself 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.460
 so many myths also listen from 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.480
 other these myths 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 let's look at all these misconceptions 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.210
 first protein delusion is expensive but 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.050
 guys 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 take for example chicken eggs buy 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.199
 look at how much you give 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.199
 money in the tens and 50 grams of protein 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 what is 50 grams of protein for athletes 100 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.960
 100 kilograms in the days when I 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.170
 worked on muscle mass it was the 90s 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.260
 years nasty was not to believe and poison day 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 ate there a little order 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.100
 50 eggs is not very pleasant 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 believe and if you buy a kilogram 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.430
 protein which stands there and a half 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.299
 thousand rubles in this kilo of propane 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.450
 conditionally kilogram of protein that's the difference 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.450
 protein is not expensive it is in your brain 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
 all that protein is an expensive product and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.390
 these 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.430
 this excuse you just yourself 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 make you not buy protein because 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.439
 that it is not enough whether it is harmful or something else 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.990
 coming up with that protein is expensive 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.350
 pleasure 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 the next protein protein plants the liver 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.829
 often heard this protein liver plant 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 why can't protein is an amino acid 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.770
 that is splitting in the digestive 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.050
 the protein tract splits into 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.500
 amino acids they are absorbed into the blood 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.590
 come in 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.210
 go to the liver is our liver and this here 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.640
 such a kind of buffet mechanism 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.820
 which amino acids assimilates that is 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.610
 that the liver was restored she needed 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.010
 amino acids if the body is not enough 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.670
 amino acids it lays out the cells 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.140
 liver to amino acids for their needs and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.480
 only then from the food are these amino acids 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.510
 takes and liver again restores 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.380
 back that is it took me here 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:52.680
 took give Putin this is a very useful thing 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.200
 she can't plant a liver 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.440
 the next myth that comes out of it 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.560
 the myth is that protein is chemistry 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.750
 just the same she puts the body 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.420
 protein is not chemistry 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.420
 protein is a natural product 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.970
 from soya protein isolated soy protein 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.820
 clean and remove all unnecessary and 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.700
 get protein you agree with that 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.760
 put your comment or milk 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.959
 protein also from milk and whey 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:33.100
 produce milk protein and it turns out 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.260
 protein we feed children milk 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.840
 infant formula where 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.519
 contains the same protein not 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.470
 we think that this chemistry 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:48.010
 why are we afraid of the ears next 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:53.190
 the myth about what you need to eat only 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.829
 on training days, I don’t see any 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.380
 bases under this myth protein is necessary 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.620
 always eat 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.920
 we need amino acids for 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.140
 building muscle oil muscle 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.019
 not built during training 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.079
 process namely when you 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.919
 have a rest here then we have a man’s 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:20.650
 grow they actively need protein 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.389
 even more active than in the period when we 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:29.870
 exercise so eat protein 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:33.259
 every day in portions of 50 grams 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.599
 several times a day that's all 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.849
