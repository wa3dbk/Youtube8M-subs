00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
going to be really really difficult to

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.840 
going to be really really difficult to
give<00:06:08.840> it<00:06:08.960> back<00:06:09.110> usually<00:06:10.010> when<00:06:10.280> I<00:06:10.340> do<00:06:10.400> a<00:06:10.490> demo<00:06:10.729> or

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
give it back usually when I do a demo or

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.520 
give it back usually when I do a demo or
play<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.210> guitar<00:06:11.510> for<00:06:11.540> short<00:06:11.930> while<00:06:12.110> get<00:06:12.500> a

play the guitar for short while get a
feel<00:06:12.770> for<00:06:12.800> it<00:06:13.100> and<00:06:13.520> then<00:06:13.639> I'll<00:06:13.760> improvise<00:06:14.000> some

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
feel for it and then I'll improvise some

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.210 
feel for it and then I'll improvise some
examples<00:06:14.960> to<00:06:15.080> demonstrate<00:06:15.110> how<00:06:15.650> we'll<00:06:15.830> use<00:06:16.010> it
