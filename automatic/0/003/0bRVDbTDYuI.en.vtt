going<00:04:58.600> deep<00:04:58.960> my<00:04:59.200> safeties<00:04:59.710> are<00:04:59.860> 62<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.639> 64

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
going deep my safeties are 62 and 64

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.629 
going deep my safeties are 62 and 64
which<00:05:02.050> i<00:05:02.200> think<00:05:02.260> is<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.650> pretty<00:05:02.979> nice<00:05:03.310> height

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
which i think is a pretty nice height

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.170 
which i think is a pretty nice height
combination<00:05:04.419> for<00:05:05.020> my<00:05:05.890> safety<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.610> first<00:05:06.850> 10

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180

spec<00:05:31.060> could<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.300> imagine<00:05:31.660> what<00:05:32.440> we<00:05:32.560> would<00:05:32.590> be

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
spec could you imagine what we would be

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.860 
spec could you imagine what we would be
like<00:05:33.010> with<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.310> night<00:05:33.520> train<00:05:33.850> that's<00:05:34.570> just

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
like with the night train that's just

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.600 
like with the night train that's just
some<00:05:35.050> food<00:05:35.289> for<00:05:35.470> thought<00:05:35.530> so<00:05:35.919> our<00:05:36.039> first<00:05:36.310> it

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
some food for thought so our first it

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.930 
some food for thought so our first it
sent<00:05:37.030> all<00:05:37.240> day<00:05:37.539> in<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.870> pocket<00:05:38.260> another

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
sent all day in the pocket another

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.200 
sent all day in the pocket another
coverage<00:05:39.940> sat<00:05:40.470> second<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.620> 16<00:05:42.370> here<00:05:42.640> we<00:05:42.760> go<00:05:42.970> I

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
coverage sat second and 16 here we go I

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.330 
coverage sat second and 16 here we go I
could<00:05:43.930> have<00:05:44.020> got<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.440> user<00:05:44.710> what<00:05:44.950> Harrison

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
could have got the user what Harrison

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.219 
could have got the user what Harrison
Smith<00:05:45.580> right<00:05:45.820> there<00:05:46.060> but<00:05:46.450> I<00:05:46.479> just<00:05:46.539> played<00:05:46.990> that

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
ball pretty poorly and that's one of the

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.960 
ball pretty poorly and that's one of the
disadvantages<00:05:49.720> of<00:05:50.289> using<00:05:50.620> those<00:05:51.400> deep<00:05:51.700> blue
