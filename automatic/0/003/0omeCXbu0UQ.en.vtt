about<00:02:04.270> half<00:02:04.330> inch<00:02:04.960> away<00:02:05.440> from<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:06.100> edge<00:02:06.220> where

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
about half inch away from the edge where

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.509 
about half inch away from the edge where
you're<00:02:06.940> cutting

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:24.990 

again<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.760> doesn't<00:02:17.000> have<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.420> perfect

finish<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.660> half<00:02:27.200> inch<00:02:28.150> circle<00:02:29.150> left

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.510 

like<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.580> now<00:02:38.580> separate<00:02:39.180> them

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.630 

when<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.240> roll<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.840> want<00:02:46.170> my<00:02:46.230> little<00:02:46.770> end<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.490> be

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
when I roll I want my little end to be

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.340 
when I roll I want my little end to be
on<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> left<00:02:48.150> side<00:02:48.450> because<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.020> easier<00:02:49.320> for

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
on the left side because it's easier for

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.340 
on the left side because it's easier for
me<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.680> i'm<00:02:49.920> looking<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.600> ok<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.020> I'm

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
me because i'm looking it ok so I'm

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.530 
me because i'm looking it ok so I'm
right-handed<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.460> start<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> body<00:02:54.300> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
right-handed so I start on the body a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.730 
right-handed so I start on the body a
bottom<00:02:55.140> right-hand<00:02:55.680> corner<00:02:56.070> when<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.550> roll<00:02:57.740> so

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
bottom right-hand corner when I roll so

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.920 
bottom right-hand corner when I roll so
the<00:02:58.830> way<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.980> roll<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.910> curve<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.660> down

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the way you roll is you curve it down

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.830 
the way you roll is you curve it down
and<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.320> want<00:03:01.710> to<00:03:01.950> use<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.820> hand<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.600> not
