00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
different points in this gigantic grid

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.830 
different points in this gigantic grid
so<00:00:52.230> Lulu<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.640> magic<00:00:54.000> users<00:00:54.300> she'll<00:00:54.510> start

spells<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.559> she'll<00:00:58.829> naturally<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.640> more

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
spells are so she'll naturally be more

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
spells are so she'll naturally be more
inclined<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> learn<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.230> spells<00:01:01.590> than<00:01:01.859> the

this map and have everyone kind of get

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.520 
this map and have everyone kind of get
good<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.670> everything<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.320> does

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
good at everything but the game does

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.100 
good at everything but the game does
sort<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> lock<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:11.490> particular<00:01:12.110> paths

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
again this ends up working quite well

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
again this ends up working quite well
you<00:01:17.340> don't<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:19.049> your
