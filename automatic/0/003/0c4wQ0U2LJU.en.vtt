 satisfied with the nation however leaving the group 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.059
 looked a little different than usual with 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.060
 each team will be able to get three teams 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 had to fight the wounded and angry 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.040
 Siberians Russia in the end but they 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.400
 in the super final met most 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.990
 the main offenders of Russian and 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.510
 Ukrainian fans he 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.970
 will present for russia and ts codeine input was 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.650
 drama of the whole tournament after the change of sides on 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.710
 map the time of the first sand won 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.470
 just one point and it already seemed like spices and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.350
 create a miracle and be able to win 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.870
 however, the tournament apparently let everything go 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.180
 did end up with ck steel 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.970
 winners with a score of 16 14 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.560
 without losing a single match for 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.060
 the whole tournament idea took home a check for 12 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.219
 thousand euro 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.930

 talks on the topic of why music died 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 the main reason from his blog are 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.640
 themselves prague who have become irrelevant and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.079
 flickering everywhere where there is a news column 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.239
 request a gyroscope 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.599
 German Tibet team announced 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.049
 new composition for such purposes than they goals 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.299
 teams still have a challenge to get out 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.129
 groups and however and it will be difficult when 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.069
 the presence of such rivals as the pace 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.230
 this way the driver has a myth 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.230
 if russia 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.459
 twenty eighth of july was exactly 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.579
 year after the tragic death in 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.469
 perhaps the best plane crash 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.469
 German player in the history of Antonius these 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.350
 inconvenience 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.060
 let's remember a kind word or 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.060
 just keep quiet in memory of antonio 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.889
 very little is left before the main thing 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.180
 gaming events of Europe one season 2011 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.589

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:47.580
 Euro 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.910
 16 players were divided into four 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.890
 groups and the main hopes we have before 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.680
 just laying on players team empire 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.459
 Ukrainian caste and dutch 200 pension 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.510
 also in other groups 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.819
 players such as measurements about 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.819
 Mongolian Stepans and Chinese black 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 chocolate judge 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.359
 July 26th was a team match 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.289
 for third place in rp al4 between teams 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.129
 favorites m couple and them in this amount 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.089
 they were predicted to play in the final in Kiev however 

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.889
 both teams did not have at all 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.069
 some luck composition for the match 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.189
 inspired optimism on an exciting fight 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:27.519
 until the last card however this 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.849
 happened who limba was upset after 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.819
 defeat the team and in the semi final so empire 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.610
 I didnâ€™t want to occupy 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.389
 fourth place in the end we would have on 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.330
 throughout the match there was no 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.959
 the slightest chance to win a score of 4 0 in 

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.909
 the empire's favor looks at least crushing 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.229
 and raises a few questions about the mood 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.429
 teams and the IMF and the Sultanate of the battle for 

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:51.909
 third place for all this action 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.169
 looked like a drain 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.830
 and in no other way hope that they would have 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.270
 will show teeth next season rp I 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.270
 here can not finally get to the final 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.779
 almost a year after the game 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.610

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.749

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.080
 blizzard remained true to their policy 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.439
 one game release six times in the course 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.360
 disputes over the novelty of the system 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.300
 Access to the game on the Internet has reached 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.069
 support rolls over and no roll 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.349
 toilet paper soiled we all 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.099
 love we play in the first part of the trilogy 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.370

 the main prize in this game 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.080
