00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
into segments and we're gonna start off

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.720 
into segments and we're gonna start off
with<00:00:44.050> his<00:00:44.380> pace<00:00:44.620> now<00:00:44.829> he's<00:00:44.980> got<00:00:45.130> 77

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
with his pace now he's got 77

strenght<00:00:48.760> now<00:00:48.880> on<00:00:49.000> paper<00:00:49.239> that<00:00:49.540> looks<00:00:50.110> very

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
strenght now on paper that looks very

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.959 
strenght now on paper that looks very
very<00:00:50.620> good<00:00:50.739> but<00:00:51.040> at<00:00:51.130> times<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.520> felt<00:00:51.700> that<00:00:51.880> he

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
very good but at times I felt that he

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.580 
very good but at times I felt that he
was<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.120> little<00:00:52.239> sluggish<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:53.020> it<00:00:53.320> would<00:00:53.410> take

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
was a little sluggish and it would take

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.560 
was a little sluggish and it would take
him<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.829> long<00:00:53.950> time<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.370> reach<00:00:54.520> that<00:00:54.550> 89<00:00:55.180> sprint

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
him a long time to reach that 89 sprint

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.000 
him a long time to reach that 89 sprint
speed<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:55.930> it's<00:00:56.020> very<00:00:56.200> hard<00:00:56.410> to<00:00:56.469> notice<00:00:56.829> when

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
speed and it's very hard to notice when

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.830 
speed and it's very hard to notice when
that<00:00:57.129> does<00:00:57.309> actually<00:00:57.460> come<00:00:57.670> into<00:00:58.030> play<00:00:58.239> there

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
that does actually come into play there

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.690 
that does actually come into play there
is<00:00:58.989> one<00:00:59.230> clip<00:00:59.500> in<00:00:59.680> particular<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.309> shows<00:01:00.460> all

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
is one clip in particular that shows all

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.250 
is one clip in particular that shows all
these<00:01:00.879> three<00:01:01.149> stats<00:01:01.450> working<00:01:01.840> hand<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.200> hand

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
these three stats working hand in hand

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.930 
these three stats working hand in hand
and<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.890> was<00:01:02.950> very<00:01:03.190> nice<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.520> see<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.670> he

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
and it was very nice to see that he

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.820 
and it was very nice to see that he
actually<00:01:04.300> did<00:01:04.479> bag<00:01:04.629> himself<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:05.199> goal<00:01:05.410> with<00:01:05.649> it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
actually did bag himself a goal with it

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.130 
actually did bag himself a goal with it
but<00:01:06.340> moving<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.030> his<00:01:07.300> shot<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.780> it's<00:01:07.899> very

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
but moving on to his shot and it's very

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.440 
but moving on to his shot and it's very
inconsistent<00:01:08.800> at<00:01:09.190> times<00:01:09.220> I'd<00:01:09.610> actually<00:01:10.240> find

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
inconsistent at times I'd actually find

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.300 
inconsistent at times I'd actually find
himself<00:01:10.600> berkley<00:01:11.140> through<00:01:11.470> for<00:01:11.860> him<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.160> only

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
himself berkley through for him to only

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.800 
himself berkley through for him to only
smash<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.759> right<00:01:13.000> down<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.330> middle<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.750> that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
smash it right down the middle and that

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.540 
smash it right down the middle and that
was<00:01:14.080> at<00:01:14.259> time<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.770> time<00:01:14.920> again<00:01:14.950> he<00:01:15.250> did<00:01:15.399> that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
was at time and time again he did that

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.999 
was at time and time again he did that
for<00:01:15.729> me<00:01:15.880> having<00:01:16.720> said<00:01:16.899> that<00:01:16.929> though<00:01:17.259> he<00:01:17.649> scored

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
for me having said that though he scored

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.680 
for me having said that though he scored
a<00:01:18.100> number<00:01:18.250> of<00:01:18.520> goals<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:19.149> it<00:01:19.420> was<00:01:19.509> just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
a number of goals and it was just

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.699 
a number of goals and it was just
getting<00:01:19.810> him<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.170> right<00:01:20.319> place<00:01:20.530> at<00:01:20.679> the

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
getting him in the right place at the

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:21.210 
getting him in the right place at the
right<00:01:20.920> time

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
right time

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.490 
right time
I<00:01:21.429> think<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.970> 87<00:01:22.630> attack<00:01:22.869> in<00:01:23.020> positioning

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
I think the 87 attack in positioning

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.949 
I think the 87 attack in positioning
only<00:01:23.770> works<00:01:23.950> ran<00:01:24.160> about<00:01:24.340> 25%<00:01:25.209> because<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
only works ran about 25% because the

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:27.389 
only works ran about 25% because the
other<00:01:26.110> percentage<00:01:26.440> he's<00:01:26.800> playing<00:01:27.039> more<00:01:27.220> like

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
other percentage he's playing more like

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.800 
other percentage he's playing more like
a<00:01:27.429> cam<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:27.759> with<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.149> high<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.360> high<00:01:28.599> work

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
a cam and with that high to high work

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.690 
a cam and with that high to high work
rates<00:01:29.110> honestly<00:01:29.890> you've<00:01:30.069> really<00:01:30.429> did<00:01:30.580> affect

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
rates honestly you've really did affect

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.510 
rates honestly you've really did affect
him<00:01:31.090> but<00:01:31.509> moving<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:31.959> to<00:01:32.229> his<00:01:32.410> passing<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.399> his

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
him but moving on to his passing and his

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.370 
him but moving on to his passing and his
passing<00:01:34.179> was<00:01:34.270> surprisingly<00:01:34.810> decent<00:01:35.110> actually

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
passing was surprisingly decent actually

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.290 
passing was surprisingly decent actually
I've<00:01:35.679> got<00:01:35.830> quite<00:01:36.069> a<00:01:36.130> few<00:01:36.190> assists<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.119> put

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
I've got quite a few assists and I put

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.180 
I've got quite a few assists and I put
through<00:01:37.599> a<00:01:37.780> few<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.349> other<00:01:38.500> strikers<00:01:39.039> so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
through a few of the other strikers so

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.059 
through a few of the other strikers so
overall<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.640> think<00:01:39.700> ur<00:01:40.030> 60<00:01:40.450> on<00:01:41.110> his<00:01:41.289> card<00:01:41.770> staff

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
overall I think ur 60 on his card staff

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.880 
overall I think ur 60 on his card staff

it was a lot more like 72 75 for moving
on<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.250> his<00:01:45.459> dribbling<00:01:45.849> and<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.660> guy<00:01:46.810> just
