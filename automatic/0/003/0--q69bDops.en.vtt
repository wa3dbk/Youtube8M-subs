00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
believe that's not his shot not a bit

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.410 
believe that's not his shot not a bit
how<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.240> winded

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.960 

you<00:01:32.080> can<00:01:32.290> see<00:01:32.590> here<00:01:33.540> his<00:01:34.540> elbow<00:01:35.850> kind<00:01:36.850> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
you can see here his elbow kind of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.499 
you can see here his elbow kind of
flares<00:01:37.600> out<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.920> he<00:01:39.070> has<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.250> hit<00:01:39.549> there<00:01:39.790> yeah

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
flares out and he has a hit there yeah

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.399 
flares out and he has a hit there yeah
but<00:01:40.540> his<00:01:40.840> elbow<00:01:41.259> kind<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.710> flares<00:01:42.100> out<00:01:42.310> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
but his elbow kind of flares out and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.170 
but his elbow kind of flares out and
even<00:01:44.409> though<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.619> right<00:01:44.830> elbows<00:01:45.189> line<00:01:45.490> you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
even though the right elbows line you

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.550 
even though the right elbows line you
know<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.360> don't<00:01:46.659> really<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.170> in<00:01:47.259> alignment

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
know I don't really see in alignment

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.789 
know I don't really see in alignment
with<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.039> left<00:01:48.250> elbow<00:01:48.549> on<00:01:48.909> this<00:01:49.810> side<00:01:50.110> there's

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
with the left elbow on this side there's

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.179 
with the left elbow on this side there's
like<00:01:51.130> pretty<00:01:51.399> much<00:01:51.549> no<00:01:51.759> alignment<00:01:52.360> there

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
like pretty much no alignment there

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.830 
like pretty much no alignment there
that's<00:01:54.189> why<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.520> believe<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.420> nice<00:01:55.539> shot

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
that's why I believe it's a nice shot

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.570 
that's why I believe it's a nice shot
and<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.200> also<00:01:56.350> believe<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.039> know<00:01:57.220> he<00:01:57.369> kind

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
and I also believe that you know he kind

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.070 
and I also believe that you know he kind
of<00:01:57.640> turns<00:01:58.080> his<00:01:59.080> body<00:01:59.409> too<00:01:59.830> much<00:02:00.840> yeah<00:02:01.840> and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
of turns his body too much yeah and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.249 
of turns his body too much yeah and
that's<00:02:02.229> why<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.590> believe<00:02:03.009> it's<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.490> his<00:02:03.759> shot

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that's why I believe it's not his shot

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.529 
that's why I believe it's not his shot
and<00:02:05.259> um<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:06.039> hear<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.610> shot<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.270> made

actually looks like the shot in the
picture<00:03:17.109> there<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.730> follow-through

picture there and the follow-through

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.960 
picture there and the follow-through

that<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.069> made<00:03:27.340> was<00:03:28.180> better<00:03:28.450> than<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.290> shot

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
that I made was better than the shot

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.720 
that I made was better than the shot
that<00:03:29.680> everyone's<00:03:30.010> saying<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.400> that's<00:03:30.519> his

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
that everyone's saying that that's his

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.790 
that everyone's saying that that's his
shot
