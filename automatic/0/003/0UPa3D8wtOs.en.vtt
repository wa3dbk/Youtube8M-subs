00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
 Yup 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.850
 Hi everyone, I say welcome 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 in my newest video where 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.500
 let's go together to dine and try 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 a microphone from the cup class I have 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.820
 just purchased which is called start 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.529
 as written on the packaging a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.360
 High performance microphone is equipped 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.220
 of mute switch 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 and base tripod for a reproduction 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.230
 natural vowel of extraordinary quality 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.309
 and then let's go together to do 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 unboxing and here is the material 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.620
 now let's go immediately to open with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.620
 tactical scissors good protection 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:58.730
 without destroying everything behind the road 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.730
 time 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.060
 how can we see how it is written 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.149
 even here in the box contains the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.219
 microphone the tripod and the guide 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.399
 use 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:20.420
 in fact we can see how here who he is 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:25.439
 the microphone that can be disconnected last 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.369
 the tripod that you should open in 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.149
 theory like that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:37.560
 ok perfect and the manual of the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:40.109
 new as we can read on 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.709
 pack with find a guarantee of 3 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.350
 years we own the trust we have 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.080
 a cable 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.560
 two and a half meters long and the cable 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.040
 jack as we can see here plated 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.040
 in gold 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 so I would say that for the trigger it 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.780
 I take the mind almost completely produced 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.690
 without writing it will be just like not 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.880
 force it all from pc i would say to switch 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.980
 to the substantial part in step 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.700
 important that is the proven therefore between 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.290
 little ok guys here we are at last 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.569
 to the audio test 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.209
 I think a good enough microphone 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.110
 in fact the recording seems to me more 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.790
 which I nevertheless expected to be optimal 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.080
 to hear you listen to yours 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.790
 opinion 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.190

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.330
