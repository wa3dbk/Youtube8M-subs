pin<00:00:41.649> registered<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:42.670> they<00:00:42.790> animated<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.390> could

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
pin registered so they animated it could

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.370 
pin registered so they animated it could

Ralph's cage could be open from various
size<00:00:49.149> so<00:00:49.510> we<00:00:49.630> could<00:00:49.780> reach<00:00:49.960> him<00:00:50.170> easily

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
size so we could reach him easily

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.479

one<00:00:54.820> frame<00:00:55.239> on<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.600> camera<00:00:56.079> is<00:00:56.530> mentioned

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
one frame on the camera is mentioned

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.150 
one frame on the camera is mentioned
there<00:00:57.520> are<00:00:57.640> 24<00:00:58.329> frames<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.960> one<00:00:59.140> second<00:00:59.770> that

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
there are 24 frames of one second that

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.600 
there are 24 frames of one second that
means<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.520> puppets<00:01:01.030> have<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.329> be<00:01:01.480> moved<00:01:02.610> 1440

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
means the puppets have to be moved 1440

means the puppets have to be moved 1440
times<00:01:03.910> for<00:01:04.509> just<00:01:04.689> one<00:01:05.019> minute<00:01:05.289> the<00:01:05.500> film<00:01:06.420> here

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
times for just one minute the film here

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.300 
times for just one minute the film here
we<00:01:07.540> step<00:01:07.869> through<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.229> animation<00:01:08.830> so<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.070> can

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
we step through the animation so you can

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.300 
we step through the animation so you can
see<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.729> separate<00:01:10.090> moves<00:01:10.650> also<00:01:11.650> notice<00:01:12.130> how

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
see the separate moves also notice how

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.520 
see the separate moves also notice how
the<00:01:12.340> different<00:01:12.850> shots<00:01:13.119> overlap<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.049> action

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
the different shots overlap the action

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.980 
the different shots overlap the action
this<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.520> an<00:01:15.640> old<00:01:15.820> trick<00:01:16.119> used<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.600> make<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
this is an old trick used to make the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.170 
this is an old trick used to make the
action<00:01:17.320> more<00:01:17.530> dramatic<00:01:18.070> when<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:18.909> see<00:01:19.060> the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
action more dramatic when you see the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.070 
action more dramatic when you see the
action<00:01:19.510> full<00:01:19.689> speed<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.229> all<00:01:20.470> flows<00:01:20.830> together

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.630 

this<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.350> shot<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:27.710> saw<00:01:27.890> just<00:01:28.220> medjool

to<00:02:19.070> fly<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.370> puppets<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:21.080> cat<00:02:21.320> was<00:02:21.560> moving

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
to fly the puppets the cat was moving

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.000 
to fly the puppets the cat was moving
approximately<00:02:22.700> 6<00:02:23.090> inches<00:02:23.240> per<00:02:23.660> frame<00:02:24.010> that's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
approximately 6 inches per frame that's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.850 
approximately 6 inches per frame that's
about<00:02:25.430> 12<00:02:25.730> feet<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:26.390> second<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.170> big

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
about 12 feet in one second the big

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.250 
about 12 feet in one second the big
moves<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.400> speed<00:02:28.730> made<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.390> necessary<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:30.110> use

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
moves and speed made it necessary to use

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.770 
moves and speed made it necessary to use
a<00:02:30.290> trick<00:02:30.590> where<00:02:30.860> we<00:02:30.950> passed<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.489> tree<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:32.480> backed

a trick where we passed a tree we backed

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.570 
a trick where we passed a tree we backed
the<00:02:32.900> camera<00:02:33.350> up<00:02:33.410> along<00:02:33.770> with<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.100> tree<00:02:34.370> and
