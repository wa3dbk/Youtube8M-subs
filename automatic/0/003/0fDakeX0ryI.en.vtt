faster<00:00:57.620> in<00:00:57.739> two<00:00:57.920> weeks<00:00:58.100> which<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.370> really

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
faster in two weeks which is really

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.670 
faster in two weeks which is really
exciting<00:00:58.969> there's<00:00:59.750> really<00:01:00.050> nothing<00:01:00.530> like

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
exciting there's really nothing like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.160 
exciting there's really nothing like
