00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hey I'm Kenny alright on this video I'm

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey I'm Kenny alright on this video I'm
gonna<00:00:03.540> show<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.959> move<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.380> I've<00:00:04.500> referred

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
gonna show you a move that I've referred

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.340 
gonna show you a move that I've referred
to<00:00:05.370> as<00:00:05.520> quarters<00:00:05.970> just<00:00:06.210> because<00:00:06.660> there's<00:00:06.870> four

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
to as quarters just because there's four

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.530 
to as quarters just because there's four
sections<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> big<00:00:08.970> complicated

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
sections to it so the big complicated

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.939 
sections to it so the big complicated
move<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.370> 1<00:00:11.370> 2<00:00:12.000> 3<00:00:12.710> 5<00:00:13.710> 6<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.730> 7<00:00:14.759> 8<00:00:15.590> alright<00:00:16.590> ways

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
move is a 1 2 3 5 6 a 7 8 alright ways

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
move is a 1 2 3 5 6 a 7 8 alright ways
that<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.400> build<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.690> first<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that we can build this up is first to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
that we can build this up is first to
just<00:00:19.320> practice<00:00:19.680> from<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.920> double<00:00:20.189> handhold<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
just practice from a double handhold and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.279 
just practice from a double handhold and
inside<00:00:21.270> rolls<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:21.930> gonna<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.199> an

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
inside rolls so that's gonna be an

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
inside rolls so that's gonna be an
inside<00:00:22.650> turn<00:00:22.859> traveling<00:00:23.430> down<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> leaders

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
inside turn traveling down the leaders

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.750 
inside turn traveling down the leaders
left<00:00:24.420> side<00:00:24.830> 1<00:00:25.830> 2<00:00:26.460> 3<00:00:27.060> 4<00:00:27.750> 5<00:00:28.439> 6<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.250> that'll<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.640> be

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
left side 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that'll just be

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.900 
left side 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that'll just be
a<00:00:29.789> traveling<00:00:30.210> six<00:00:30.480> count<00:00:30.720> pattern<00:00:34.040> 5<00:00:35.040> 6<00:00:35.640> things

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a traveling six count pattern 5 6 things

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
a traveling six count pattern 5 6 things
that<00:00:36.090> we're<00:00:36.210> looking<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.750> continuing

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that we're looking for is continuing

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
that we're looking for is continuing
issue<00:00:37.489> continuation<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> momentum<00:00:39.149> down<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
issue continuation of momentum down a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
issue continuation of momentum down a
line<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.829> making<00:00:41.010> sure<00:00:41.280> that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
line and then also just making sure that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
line and then also just making sure that
the<00:00:41.579> woman<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.210> follow<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.930> continuing

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the woman is the follow is continuing

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
the woman is the follow is continuing
her<00:00:43.620> momentum<00:00:43.860> by<00:00:44.129> driving<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:45.120> side

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
her momentum by driving that right side

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
her momentum by driving that right side
into<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> turn<00:00:46.640> next<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.210> 1<00:00:48.989> 2<00:00:49.590> 3<00:00:50.190> 4

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
into that turn next one is going 1 2 3 4

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
into that turn next one is going 1 2 3 4
5<00:00:51.600> 6<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.800> one's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.520> more

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
5 6 this one's a little bit more

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.110 
5 6 this one's a little bit more
complicated<00:00:55.460> it's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> bit<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> an<00:00:56.879> illusion

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
complicated it's a bit of an illusion

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.740 
complicated it's a bit of an illusion
turn<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.149> side<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
turn so this right side is going to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.930 
turn so this right side is going to
travel<00:01:00.960> closer<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.920> our<00:01:02.010> partner<00:01:02.340> well<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
travel closer to our partner well this

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
travel closer to our partner well this
one<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.210> gonna<00:01:03.300> take<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> wider<00:01:03.989> circumference

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
one is gonna take a wider circumference

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.210 
one is gonna take a wider circumference
and<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.549> gonna<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.820> about<00:01:05.960> swiping<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and I'm gonna think about swiping at the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.260 
and I'm gonna think about swiping at the
elbow<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.240> can

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
elbow right there and then we can

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.620 
elbow right there and then we can
continue<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> line

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.520 

two<00:01:14.409> three<00:01:15.159> four<00:01:15.909> five<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.990> six<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.469> that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
two three four five of the six and that

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.429 
two three four five of the six and that
swipe<00:01:17.799> is<00:01:17.950> going<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.189> come<00:01:18.340> on<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.549> count<00:01:18.759> for

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
swipe is going to come on the count for

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.630 
swipe is going to come on the count for
another<00:01:20.439> version<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.829> we<00:01:21.009> can<00:01:21.159> do<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.520> again

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
another version that we can do is again

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.950 
another version that we can do is again
starting<00:01:22.149> out<00:01:22.270> from<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.479> double<00:01:22.750> handhold

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
starting out from a double handhold

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.740 
starting out from a double handhold
we're<00:01:23.590> gonna<00:01:23.710> do<00:01:23.920> an<00:01:24.159> eight<00:01:25.119> count<00:01:25.360> inside

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
we're gonna do an eight count inside

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.929 
we're gonna do an eight count inside
roll<00:01:26.049> so<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.829> double<00:01:27.189> though<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.820> we're

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
roll so with the double though so we're

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.130 
roll so with the double though so we're
gonna<00:01:28.030> go<00:01:28.210> one<00:01:28.719> two<00:01:29.380> three<00:01:29.729> four<00:01:30.729> five<00:01:31.420> six

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
gonna go one two three four five six

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.219 
gonna go one two three four five six
seven<00:01:32.829> and<00:01:33.159> eight<00:01:33.490> that's<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.509> leader<00:01:34.720> you

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
seven and eight that's the leader you

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.210 
seven and eight that's the leader you
have<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.470> really<00:01:35.649> make<00:01:35.829> sure<00:01:36.039> you're

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
have to really make sure you're

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.399 
have to really make sure you're
continuing<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.390> down<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.750> line<00:01:37.780> momentum

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
continuing that down the line momentum

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.940 
continuing that down the line momentum
even<00:01:38.619> as<00:01:39.009> you're<00:01:39.159> turning<00:01:39.810> three<00:01:40.810> four<00:01:41.409> five

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
even as you're turning three four five

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.819 
even as you're turning three four five
six<00:01:42.659> seven<00:01:43.659> eight<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:43.960> I'm<00:01:44.020> still<00:01:44.259> allowing<00:01:44.619> my

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
six seven eight so I'm still allowing my

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.010 
six seven eight so I'm still allowing my
arm<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.189> travel<00:01:45.549> behind<00:01:45.819> me<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.780> direction

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
arm to travel behind me in the direction

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.889 
arm to travel behind me in the direction
that<00:01:47.170> I'd<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.679> follow<00:01:47.860> her<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.159> go<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.750> the

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
that I'd like to follow her to go so the

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.870 
that I'd like to follow her to go so the
next<00:01:50.080> move<00:01:50.289> big<00:01:50.830> finale<00:01:51.130> number<00:01:51.520> from<00:01:51.789> a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
next move big finale number from a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.589 
next move big finale number from a
different<00:01:52.060> angle<00:01:55.170> four<00:01:56.170> five<00:01:56.799> six<00:01:57.490> seven<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
different angle four five six seven and

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.550 
different angle four five six seven and
eight<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.560> check<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.920> out<00:02:00.099> slowly<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
eight so check this out slowly so it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.589 
eight so check this out slowly so it
goes<00:02:03.119> over<00:02:04.119> her<00:02:05.020> head<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.880> head<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.360> for<00:02:07.569> a

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
goes over her head my head so for a

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.150
