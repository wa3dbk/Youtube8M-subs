 kilometer 39 of the old highway towards 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.070
 acapulco at the moment they are 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 working at forced marches as you will see 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.730
 the army is working for in 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.739
 less than 24 hours open this access to 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.620
 thousands of tourists who are the ones who go to 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.720
 go through here to return to the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.000
 Mexico City right now they are 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.860
 opening every hour are opening and 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.280
 are allowing the access of few 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.110
 vehicles that you carry live some some 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.739
 people are allowing them access 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.830
 pedestrian way and we have also seen that 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.839
 have passed a couple of bodies that 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.180
 they take of course one to the city ​​of 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.270
 mexico and another that take it to a 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.189
 community that is very close to this 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.860
 where we are in these 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.229
 moments of time because everything is very 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.970
 complicated because in less than 24 hours 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.220
 the communications secretary and 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.990
 transports has said that it will not open the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.560
 step for tomorrow that is 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.540
 scheduled at 12 a.m. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.310
 because the soldiers have informed us 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.500
 army has informed us that if it is going to 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 open though as you'll see it's very dangerous 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.130
 because here in this seven-day zone 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.110
 59 and everything comes down to the fact that this is very 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.330
 dangerous for those who are going to circulate the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.010
 earth is softened and we are going to 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.869
 continue to wait for the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.420
 instructions given by the authorities 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.820

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 to walk on this road I return the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.900
