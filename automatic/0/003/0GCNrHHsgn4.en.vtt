00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.860
 Well then, this time you are the child's driving apprentice in the handling of the boiler , which is the boiler 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.839
 I would like to see how to stop 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.249
 First of all, I 'm a Mountain Disciple, but looking at the fire-fighting method for oil-fired boilers 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.890
 I want to go there 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:22.940
 Ne 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:24.170
 First of all, the oil stopper of the main burner is also stopped with certainty and the supply of fuel is stopped. 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.170
 To make 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:35.450
 Hard-to-work O out to stop yo like a state are also get some leakage fuel Ja' among loose 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 In the case of an oil burner , pull out the burner from the combustion chamber and clean it up . 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.790
 Part 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:45.010
 When the burden inspection to one burner 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.360
 After doing this in the relationship with gout to make a check on gas emissions not taken 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.430
 And throw the damper 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:01:00.620
 In addition, the boiler water should be 33 to 50 mm higher than regular water and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.620
 If the pressure rise stops and the main steam valve is occupied and the drain in the pipe is removed 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.010
 Stand refused to day service short径塑image large amount of heat source 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.000
 But in the case of a cold area, it means that let's keep the goods through a little heat 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000
 It's up to here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:26.000
 In the case of automatic control, it's up to here here when you're doing it by hand in the waterfall so far here 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.000
 But in case of automatic control , 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.400
 I'll do it on my own, so I'll stop it 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.820
 To confirm whether the to operate is proceeding as programmed logic by a sequence 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.620
 It means that it will be 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 8 If I add some supplements 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.980
 If the pressure stops rising, take up the main steam valve and remove the drain in the pipe . 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.240
 but 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:57.909
 The sound of Marlen falls in a large-scale boiler 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.580
 If it is a person who is using a lot of bricks in the combustion chamber in a brick-only task 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.020
 a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:09.470
 It is quite still with the residual heat of the brick that the brick has been crawling 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:15.890
 The pressure is stopped because the steam is coming out and the hot water gets pretty high 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.370
 If it says stop or above pressure stops rising , use the above and stop the main steam valve 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.770
 Because 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.570
 No Ricoh 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:28.600
 Just because not even be entering the use destination a me ok If you stop erase fuel pet 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.819
 I think it 's still hot in the boiler with the remaining heat of the bricks so I 'll play with it again 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.230
 I'm getting higher 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:39.300
 Because it's easy to get tired of things that might seem like it's getting too expensive to play 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.690
 Please say that let's close the arrival to the living room after the pressure rise has stopped properly 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.569
 Then remove the drain in the piping 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.019
 It means 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:53.590
 Even though in the case of boiler only oil I got to the digestion in the well such form Did this side supplement 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:58.629
 So as I what about boiler do other 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.200
 What is the say to digest the umbrella seat skill boiler and the card is basically will feel it gas 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.560
 Though 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.590
 It is same as the procedure ahead, but in the case of gas boiler 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 There are things that you have to be especially careful about 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.290
 Gas is harmful to the human body and there is a high risk of ignition. 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.010
 Let's reconfirm that each stop valve is completely a soldier . 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.459
 Ne 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.280
 Then the points of caution of the commercial house in the case of a coal fired boiler 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.840
 In the case of a coal fired boiler 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:32.130
 The pressure increase due to the day of the bride and the 4 heats is remarkable 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:38.220
 So if I'm careless I'm going to blow up with the department like this 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:43.270
 Let 's put the virtual feed into a stop condition while adjusting the suite rising pressure 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:47.320
 Anyway , let's be careful that the pressure rise of the residual heat is significant 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.590
 The boiler has now stopped safely 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 When you stop, it doesn't mean you 're going back 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.660
 Once stopped 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:03.400
 Check all Stop operation of the boiler and stop operation When all operations are finished again 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.810
 Let's check around the boiler for safety, so what should we check 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.959
 If it is not 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.130
 Is the fresh fish edition courtesy properly worn 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.460
 From 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.970
 Ascend climber check the steam pressure water 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.560
 Whether or not the opening and closing operation of the valve is securely carried out 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.880
 Lay the revelation 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.139
 In when the check, such as there is no steam leakage or sound 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.129
 What cut 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.950
 I Toka'll there is a place that is saying something Tsu curse sure to or position so that there is no such a thing 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:37.290
 Check for steam leaks 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:42.420
 Had a confirmation in a water tank in a vacuum pump the recovery of by slaves of the heating boiler in 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.170
 Fuel consumption amount Let's keep the usage amount and the amount of adjustment agent of water supply amount boiler 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.830
 It is a place 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:52.030
 It is the place that said this after the boiler stop 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:56.250
 It is that let's check these children, so far in the boiler 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.250
 About the owner of the stop driving
