00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
pump to a Jandy control panel so it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.940 
pump to a Jandy control panel so it
works<00:00:14.360> just<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.809> same<00:00:14.870> way<00:00:15.260> a<00:00:15.290> would<00:00:15.590> is<00:00:15.769> if

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
works just the same way a would is if

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.060 
works just the same way a would is if
you<00:00:16.099> had<00:00:16.280> an<00:00:16.400> e<00:00:16.670> pump<00:00:17.110> so<00:00:18.110> let's<00:00:18.650> check<00:00:18.830> it<00:00:18.860> out

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
you had an e pump so let's check it out

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.160 
you had an e pump so let's check it out
right<00:00:19.220> now<00:00:19.250> okay<00:00:21.850> so<00:00:23.050> here<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.230> our<00:00:24.650> pin<00:00:25.130> tear

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170

did<00:00:42.909> and<00:00:43.909> it's<00:00:44.269> an<00:00:44.449> instruction<00:00:45.109> manual<00:00:46.359> the

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
did and it's an instruction manual the

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.259 
did and it's an instruction manual the
key<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.229> just<00:00:48.409> getting<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.979> wires

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
key to this is just getting the wires

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.239

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.210 

okay<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.179> see<00:00:59.479> this<00:01:01.659> communication<00:01:02.659> wire

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
okay you see this communication wire

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.800 
okay you see this communication wire
that<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.280> going<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:04.970> go<00:01:05.120> up<00:01:05.390> into<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.200> panel

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
that is going to go up into the panel

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.090 
that is going to go up into the panel
it's<00:01:08.810> right<00:01:09.020> here<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:11.480> it<00:01:12.200> goes<00:01:12.230> in<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
it's right here and it goes in the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.920 
it's right here and it goes in the
middle<00:01:13.490> two<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:15.560> your<00:01:16.520> comm<00:01:16.970> port<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.630> for

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
middle two of your comm port here for

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.980 
middle two of your comm port here for
wire<00:01:18.140> comm<00:01:18.470> port<00:01:19.000> goes<00:01:20.000> into<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.450> middle<00:01:20.660> -
