me talking let's go take a close-up look

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.859 
me talking let's go take a close-up look
at<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.130> Triceratops<00:00:29.880> mark<00:00:30.210> alright<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
at this Triceratops mark alright so

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.880 
at this Triceratops mark alright so
we're<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.050> start<00:00:31.140> off<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> head<00:00:31.710> now

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
we're gonna start off with the head now

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.990 
we're gonna start off with the head now
the<00:00:31.949> head<00:00:32.219> has<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> good<00:00:32.730> amount<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the head has a good amount of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.979 
the head has a good amount of
articulation

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
articulation

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.959 
articulation
you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.469> move<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:34.950> side<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> side<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you can move it from side to side or you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.010 
you can move it from side to side or you
can<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> make<00:00:37.469> them<00:00:37.649> black<00:00:37.879> or<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:39.899> know

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
can kind of make them black or you know

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
can kind of make them black or you know
you<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.290> several<00:00:40.950> options<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> can

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you have several options of what you can

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.520 
you have several options of what you can
do<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> head<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.410> we

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
do with the head and as you can see we

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
do with the head and as you can see we
have<00:00:43.649> some<00:00:43.829> cow<00:00:43.980> horns<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.670> two<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> horns

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
have some cow horns for two of the horns

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.950 
have some cow horns for two of the horns
and<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.590> slope<00:00:47.129> brick<00:00:47.960> for<00:00:50.030> front<00:00:51.030> horn<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and this slope brick for front horn and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.799 
and this slope brick for front horn and
then<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.010> mouth<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.270> open<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
then we have the mouth that can open and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.920 
then we have the mouth that can open and
close<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.090> let's<00:00:57.239> move<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> body

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
close and so let's move on to the body

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
close and so let's move on to the body
now<00:00:58.410> connected<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> head<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.280> some

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
now connected to the head we have some

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
now connected to the head we have some
gray<00:01:00.180> Rick's<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.600> responsible<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
gray Rick's that are responsible for the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
gray Rick's that are responsible for the
articulation<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> head<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> see

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
articulation of the head and you can see

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950 
articulation of the head and you can see
we<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.290> minifigure<00:01:05.280> hands<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.330> we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
we have some minifigure hands and we

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
we have some minifigure hands and we
have<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.760> skeleton<00:01:08.790> arms<00:01:09.030> used<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.479> create

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
have these skeleton arms used to create

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
have these skeleton arms used to create
that<00:01:10.320> effect<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> spine<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that effect on the spine right there and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.060 
that effect on the spine right there and
then<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.920> have

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
then down here you can see that we have

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.780 
then down here you can see that we have
some<00:01:14.220> r2d2<00:01:14.790> parts<00:01:15.720> used<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> some<00:01:17.280> Technic

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
some r2d2 parts used and some Technic

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
some r2d2 parts used and some Technic
bricks<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> create<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> legs<00:01:19.049> some<00:01:19.650> arch

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
bricks to create the legs some arch

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.399 
bricks to create the legs some arch
breaks<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> create<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> ribcage<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.409> similar

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
breaks to create the ribcage and similar

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.550 
breaks to create the ribcage and similar
design<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.390> legs<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.470> have

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
design on the back legs and then we have

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.670 
design on the back legs and then we have
the<00:01:25.650> hip<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.720> right<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the hip right here and right here is the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.890 
the hip right here and right here is the
tail<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.820> connected<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> ratcheting

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
tail which is connected to a ratcheting

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.170 
tail which is connected to a ratcheting
Technic<00:01:31.860> pin<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.630> swing<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
Technic pin and so you can swing it and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.399 
Technic pin and so you can swing it and
so<00:01:36.180> basically<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.689> same<00:01:36.869> thing<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> other

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so basically the same thing on the other

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
so basically the same thing on the other
side<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.619> basically<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.549> there

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
side and so that is basically all there

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.600 
side and so that is basically all there
is<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.720> Lego<00:01:43.369> Triceratops
