00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that's a welcome sign compared to where

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
that's a welcome sign compared to where
we<00:02:26.910> were<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.420> we've<00:02:28.200> got<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.470> keep<00:02:28.590> on

increasing that rate of growth and keep
adding<00:02:31.560> jobs<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.489> keep<00:02:32.670> moving

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
adding jobs so we can keep moving

forward and that's especially important

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.680 
forward and that's especially important
for<00:02:35.340> places<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.030> 12<00:02:39.300> months

lean mean operation and so they're

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.080 
lean mean operation and so they're
people<00:04:48.720> loop's<00:04:49.310> still<00:04:50.310> lost<00:04:50.550> their<00:04:50.820> jobs

haven't been hired back and it wasn't
