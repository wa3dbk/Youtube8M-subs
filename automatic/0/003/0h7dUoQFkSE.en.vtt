I<00:03:50.780> think<00:03:50.930> it's<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.290> how<00:03:51.590> many<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.860> feel<00:03:52.100> but

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
I think it's just how many you feel but

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.860 
I think it's just how many you feel but
that<00:03:52.460> wouldn't<00:03:52.610> make<00:03:52.700> sense<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:53.240> know<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:53.480> didn't

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
kill just born actually I think that

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.400

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
might be it
