00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.610
 Now that I bring you a video of is more or 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.100
 minus a tutorial on how to play 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.280
 the games of the hunger games ' 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.379
 minecraft 0.8 point 1 version hike 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.789
 although it is the only one there is and well what 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.740
 only thing to do is come here 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:22.660
 to give play to give it here to hurt 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.420
 here in edit and give it external 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.760
 as you see here I already have two to see that 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.040
 are these two if they fail to notice 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.610
 and good to add the only thing 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.030
 we have to do is the external one and here 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.940
 in the dress we have to put the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.090
 the ip of the servef for example is axis 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.500
 good an example this is the ip for 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.210
 can play the games of hunger that is 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.900
 that point 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.080
 lb sg dot net 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.520
 and we give him a gift and there he will be ready and 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.880
 then in the name they put what 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.880
 want 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.150
 and well below where it says port is the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.690
 good harbor now the same thing gets 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 likewise 191 32 and then we're going to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.810
 add a beer to make see and what 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.120
 we will now have the only thing that there is 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.760
 to do is give equipment to enter 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.830
 As you can see I am already entering one and 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.770
 well you do not need to do anything more than 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.750
 that and there they will be able to play in the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.240
 Hunger games in the latest version 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.780
 of microsoft that there is for now in frizz 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.960
 I said to see if I go in for more 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.760
 or less know how it is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.159
 the truth that quite funny to me is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.740
 It has been stuck to me, it has not been 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.619
 stopped the screen when I've 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.450
 played something that other cell phones do not 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.090
 it has happened as you see I just entered one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.980
 how to write something like 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.570
 Hello 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.000
 and good, here the account will start 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 regressive for example that says that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.060
 two minutes are missing and in those two minutes 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.600
 is going to start the games game 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.570
 of hunger the ips I'll leave the ips 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.030
 I'll leave it in the description of 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.980
 video and well if you do not know me and it's 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.470
 first time they have seen my videos 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.270
 well go through my channel I upload minecraft 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.600
 pocket edition and place on android 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.620
 although it did not rise much more than minecraft 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.620
 but well that does not matter 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.240
 good 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.040
 I hope you have served them there are also 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.500
 other servers like for example this one 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.270
 that says worlds that is the world that we 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.730
 love rajoy 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.290
 I know it's started but I do not know what it is 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.930
 frame because said because I go in and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.060
 I suppose if the hunger games and 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.650
 nothing there are also others to capture the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.480
 flag that I do not remember the pp and good 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.630
 this has been all hopefully they have 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.330
 liked if it served them like and if not 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.120
 consider a single saga 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.170
