00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 we are two teams we are in an area 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.450
 very high in the wagons and consists of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.930
 that each team has a capital we leave 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.930
 society 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.680
 and the other team endorses the important 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 is to get to the bottom that only 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 can get to take the charge to come 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 to look for your classmates only 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.359
 the captain can go down and he has to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.130
 find a parachute among all 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.480
 these wagons the others you have to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.310
 use the bazooka to kill the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 good enemies the captain so now 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.850
 kill the captain of the captain of the other 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 team but once you take the charge 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.510
 and the bazooka is forgotten because if not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 It would be very easy to shoot a charger and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.629
 now already after starting to be 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 there from her when she has the position 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.780
 the captains have to climb up and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.629
 we have to jump into office 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
 to jump I repeat to the charge to one of his 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.070
 engines on their sides jump to that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.800
 charge once that the ones that each 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.870
 captain have his two companions in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 charge will go down to the area below and in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.840
 the area below you will see that there are two 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.430
 titans and we will have to take a race is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.660
 say get to see who arrives first 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 to the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.100
 to the airport 321 of argentina 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.789
 Uncovered dude who had to let 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.789
 go out 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.679
 to each of the teammates 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.869
 we have to try to wait in an area 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.909
 high to the two capitals to get up 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.130
 to charge open is worth three subjects to take the 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.140
 charge bonus but the shit people fuck 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.729
 good but do not shoot down bastards 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.729

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:01.259

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.259

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.049

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.049

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.710

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.519
 quiet that we go back I went with the 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.890
 propellers from above you have to go down 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.489
 have up a little bit more prepare and 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.489
 jumps 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:42.120
 to see what came to life came to us 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.120

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.979
