00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.949
I am here.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.509

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.169
...eighty-one

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.140
You will stay with me until it is time to
go back to the school.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.160
It is an order.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.820
It is an order.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.580
Where should I put this?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.580
You will sleep here!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.730
Are you afraid?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.470
Afraid of what?

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.420
I've seen things like this many times.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.800
One day I fell asleep in the museum at Lahore.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.540
Found myself looked in for the night.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.500
Nothing happened!

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Shake hands, O'hara!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.260

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.330
Wana learns quickly.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.630
Come, O'Hara, let me see you match wits with him.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.630
Bring me the tray.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.930
And look at them well.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.740
Finger them if you like.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.120
Get their number and their colour in your mind's eye.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.070
One glance is enough for me.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.070
Ready?

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.110

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.660
Oh, that's easy.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.590
Twenty-six perhaps twenty seven.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.459
