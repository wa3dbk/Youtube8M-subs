00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.560 

in<00:00:06.830> this<00:00:07.310> lesson<00:00:07.550> we're<00:00:07.790> going<00:00:07.880> to<00:00:07.939> look<00:00:08.120> at<00:00:08.360> a

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
in this lesson we're going to look at a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.830 
in this lesson we're going to look at a
little<00:00:09.170> lick<00:00:09.350> that<00:00:09.590> I<00:00:09.680> use<00:00:09.920> quite<00:00:10.219> a<00:00:10.250> lot<00:00:10.840> which

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
little lick that I use quite a lot which

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.539 
little lick that I use quite a lot which
basically<00:00:12.260> comes<00:00:12.590> from<00:00:12.830> a<00:00:12.889> classic<00:00:13.039> drum

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
basically comes from a classic drum

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.580 
basically comes from a classic drum
groove<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:14.539> groove<00:00:14.719> from<00:00:14.869> the<00:00:15.049> meters

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
groove the groove from the meters

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.850 
groove the groove from the meters
sissy<00:00:15.889> strips<00:00:16.900> it's<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.050> middle<00:00:18.350> part<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:18.740> a

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
sissy strips it's the middle part of a

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.250 
sissy strips it's the middle part of a
little<00:00:19.279> triplet<00:00:19.640> pie<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:19.940> the<00:00:20.029> middle<00:00:20.330> which

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
little triplet pie in the middle which

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.230 
little triplet pie in the middle which
works<00:00:21.560> really<00:00:21.740> really<00:00:22.040> well<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.970> it<00:00:23.090> also

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
works really really well and it also

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.330 
works really really well and it also
helps<00:00:23.660> us<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:23.870> keep<00:00:23.990> momentum<00:00:24.620> in<00:00:24.920> our<00:00:25.040> fills

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
helps us to keep momentum in our fills

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.029 
helps us to keep momentum in our fills
by<00:00:26.300> momentum<00:00:26.900> what<00:00:27.140> I<00:00:27.170> mean<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.890> many

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
by momentum what I mean is to many

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.880 
by momentum what I mean is to many
people<00:00:28.490> play<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:29.030> groove<00:00:29.330> get<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.350> groove<00:00:30.590> locked

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
people play a groove get a groove locked

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.310 
people play a groove get a groove locked
in<00:00:31.100> get<00:00:31.490> it<00:00:31.580> solid<00:00:31.970> get<00:00:32.419> everybody<00:00:32.750> moving<00:00:32.930> get

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
in get it solid get everybody moving get

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.560 
in get it solid get everybody moving get
everybody<00:00:33.620> dancing<00:00:34.039> and<00:00:34.250> then<00:00:35.149> play<00:00:35.360> some

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
everybody dancing and then play some

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.210 
everybody dancing and then play some
crazy<00:00:35.930> fill<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.410> goes<00:00:36.560> all<00:00:36.739> around<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.010> kit

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
crazy fill that goes all around the kit

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.729 
crazy fill that goes all around the kit
lose<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.270> momentum<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:39.320> then<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:39.530> have<00:00:39.650> to

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
lose the momentum and then we have to

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.220 
lose the momentum and then we have to
start<00:00:39.980> all<00:00:40.070> over<00:00:40.100> again<00:00:40.570> using<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.690> exercises

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
start all over again using the exercises

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.229 
start all over again using the exercises
like<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:42.590> using<00:00:42.829> fills<00:00:43.160> like<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:43.520> really

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
like this using fills like this really

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.850 
like this using fills like this really
keeps<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.570> momentum<00:00:44.989> because<00:00:45.260> if<00:00:45.380> many<00:00:45.530> let's

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
keeps the momentum because if many let's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.610 
keeps the momentum because if many let's
just<00:00:46.010> keep<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.280> backbeat<00:00:46.670> in<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.210> field<00:00:47.620> so

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
just keep the backbeat in the field so

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.220 
just keep the backbeat in the field so
I'll<00:00:48.770> demonstrate<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:50.270> very<00:00:50.600> slowly<00:00:50.960> for

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
I'll demonstrate this very slowly for

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.170 
I'll demonstrate this very slowly for
you<00:00:51.350> first<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.980> then<00:00:52.280> we'll<00:00:52.460> build<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.790> up<00:00:52.910> and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
you first and then we'll build it up and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.549 
you first and then we'll build it up and
I'll<00:00:53.540> show<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.750> what<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:54.050> can<00:00:54.200> do<00:00:54.320> with<00:00:54.440> it

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
I'll show you what we can do with it

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'll show you what we can do with it
from<00:00:54.680> there

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
from there

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.040 
from there
so<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.270> first<00:00:56.480> thing<00:00:56.630> I'm<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.899> do<00:00:56.960> is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.780 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
demonstrate<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.829> actual<00:00:57.950> groove<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.640> this

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
demonstrate the actual groove that this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.850 
demonstrate the actual groove that this
exercise<00:00:59.480> comes<00:00:59.750> from<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:00.739> the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
exercise comes from and that's the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.860 
exercise comes from and that's the
groove<00:01:01.100> as<00:01:01.399> I<00:01:01.460> said<00:01:01.760> from<00:01:01.940> sissy<00:01:02.270> struts<00:01:02.690> by

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
groove as I said from sissy struts by

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.679 
groove as I said from sissy struts by
the<00:01:03.320> meters<00:01:03.800> it's<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.729> track<00:01:05.149> really<00:01:05.420> that

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
the meters it's a track really that

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.450 
the meters it's a track really that
every<00:01:05.960> drummer<00:01:06.229> should<00:01:06.950> know<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.250> groove

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
every drummer should know the groove

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:38.769 
every drummer should know the groove
time<00:01:36.759> ok<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:37.789> now<00:01:38.029> you've<00:01:38.179> seen<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.420> basic

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:38.779 
time ok so now you've seen the basic

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.870 
time ok so now you've seen the basic
groove<00:01:38.990> I'm<00:01:39.679> gonna<00:01:39.920> pull<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.189> little<00:01:40.279> bit<00:01:40.759> of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
groove I'm gonna pull a little bit of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.919 
groove I'm gonna pull a little bit of
that<00:01:40.999> groove<00:01:41.209> out<00:01:41.389> and<00:01:41.599> show<00:01:41.749> you<00:01:41.810> this

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.260 
that groove out and show you this
exercise<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.409> we're<00:01:42.679> going<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.829> work<00:01:42.950> with

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
exercise that we're going to work with

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.849 
exercise that we're going to work with
the<00:01:44.270> basics<00:01:44.719> of<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.899> exercise<00:01:45.409> here's<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
the basics of the exercise here's the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.969 
the basics of the exercise here's the
sticking<00:01:46.249> part<00:01:46.490> which<00:01:47.149> is<00:01:47.179> right<00:01:47.899> left<00:01:48.439> foot

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
left foot left right foot left now we've

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.389 
left foot left right foot left now we've
got<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.079> try<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.319> make<00:02:00.499> sure<00:02:00.529> that<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.979> swings

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
got to try to make sure that this swings

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.999 
got to try to make sure that this swings
a<00:02:01.639> little<00:02:01.669> bit<00:02:02.029> and<00:02:02.359> it<00:02:03.289> won't<00:02:03.529> work<00:02:03.649> if<00:02:03.859> it's

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
a little bit and it won't work if it's

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.649 
a little bit and it won't work if it's
really<00:02:04.279> straight<00:02:04.549> but<00:02:04.969> as<00:02:05.060> we<00:02:05.209> demonstrate

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
really straight but as we demonstrate

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.940 
really straight but as we demonstrate
this<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.139> we'll<00:02:06.889> see<00:02:07.119> what's<00:02:08.119> meant<00:02:08.330> by<00:02:08.509> that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
this and we'll see what's meant by that

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.870 
this and we'll see what's meant by that
first<00:02:09.950> thing<00:02:10.069> I'm<00:02:10.130> gonna<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.550> snare

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
first thing I'm gonna do it on the snare
