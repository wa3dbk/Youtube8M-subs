different tom shankster's with the hands
we're<00:00:26.449> going<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.630> explore<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.930> bar<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.320> 3/16<00:00:27.949> 516

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
we're going to explore a bar of 3/16 516

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.229 
we're going to explore a bar of 3/16 516
7<00:00:29.539> 16<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.080> even<00:00:30.170> 9<00:00:30.470> 16<00:00:30.980> over<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.609> ostinato<00:00:31.910> and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
7 16 and even 9 16 over the ostinato and

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.939 
7 16 and even 9 16 over the ostinato and
I<00:00:32.270> guess<00:00:32.449> pretty<00:00:32.599> difficult<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.350> what<00:00:33.859> I'd

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
I guess pretty difficult so what I'd

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.439 
I guess pretty difficult so what I'd
like<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.129> do<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:34.609> start<00:00:34.789> off<00:00:35.000> just<00:00:35.210> playing

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
like to do is start off just playing

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.500 
like to do is start off just playing
simple<00:00:35.659> single<00:00:36.260> strokes<00:00:40.120> once<00:00:41.120> again<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:41.420> can

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
simple single strokes once again we can

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.139 
simple single strokes once again we can
play<00:00:41.659> four<00:00:41.839> on<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.019> floor<00:00:42.199> if<00:00:42.289> you<00:00:42.350> wanted<00:00:42.620> to

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.849 

we<00:00:47.149> feel<00:00:47.329> comfortable<00:00:47.510> change<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:48.440> sticking

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
we feel comfortable change the sticking

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.129 
we feel comfortable change the sticking
two<00:00:49.159> right<00:00:49.399> left<00:00:49.699> left<00:00:49.879> still<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.659> sixteenth

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
two right left left still a sixteenth

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:52.899 
two right left left still a sixteenth
notes<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:51.889> right<00:00:52.100> left<00:00:52.339> left<00:00:52.519> so<00:00:52.699> you<00:00:52.760> get

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
notes but right left left so you get

00:00:52.909 --> 00:01:03.009 
notes but right left left so you get
this<00:01:00.879> let's<00:01:01.879> add<00:01:01.999> a<00:01:02.030> basic<00:01:02.600> four<00:01:02.809> on<00:01:02.869> the<00:01:02.929> floor

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
this let's add a basic four on the floor

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:14.470 
this let's add a basic four on the floor
pattern<00:01:03.469> we'll<00:01:03.679> get<00:01:03.829> this<00:01:13.150> this<00:01:14.150> is<00:01:14.270> really

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
pattern we'll get this this is really

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.880 
pattern we'll get this this is really
interesting<00:01:14.720> because<00:01:14.960> your<00:01:15.200> right<00:01:15.410> hand<00:01:15.680> but

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
interesting because your right hand but

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.560 
interesting because your right hand but
want<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.100> chase<00:01:16.400> your<00:01:16.640> right<00:01:16.790> foot<00:01:17.060> it<00:01:17.330> wants

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
want to chase your right foot it wants

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.240 
want to chase your right foot it wants
to<00:01:17.630> do<00:01:17.720> that<00:01:20.440> say<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> right<00:01:21.740> foot<00:01:21.980> want<00:01:22.190> to

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
to do that say the right foot want to

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.890 
to do that say the right foot want to
trace<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.490> right<00:01:22.670> hand<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:23.450> try<00:01:23.750> and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
trace the right hand so so try and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.810 
trace the right hand so so try and
almost<00:01:24.410> as<00:01:24.500> easy<00:01:24.680> as<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.890> zoning<00:01:25.340> out<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:25.670> your

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
almost as easy as a zoning out so your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.890 
almost as easy as a zoning out so your
feet<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.150> just<00:01:26.300> playing<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:26.540> simple

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
feet is just playing this simple

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.430 
feet is just playing this simple
ostinato

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.480 

that's<00:01:37.440> really<00:01:37.710> interesting<00:01:37.890> thing<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.370> can

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that's really interesting thing you can

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.980 
that's really interesting thing you can
do<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:38.790> many<00:01:38.970> cool<00:01:39.120> things<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.630> once

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
do so many cool things with this once

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.360 
do so many cool things with this once
again<00:01:40.290> our<00:01:40.440> basic<00:01:40.800> principle<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.220> going

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
again our basic principle are going

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.850 
again our basic principle are going
floor<00:01:41.850> tom<00:01:42.090> ride<00:01:42.450> snow<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.990> she's<00:01:43.140> done<00:01:43.290> before

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
floor tom ride snow if she's done before

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
floor tom ride snow if she's done before
a<00:01:47.420> sixteenth<00:01:48.420> note<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.050> some

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a sixteenth note so you can do some

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080 
a sixteenth note so you can do some
really<00:01:49.350> cool<00:01:49.560> things<00:01:49.619> once<00:01:50.130> again<00:01:50.400> I'll<00:01:50.729> start

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
really cool things once again I'll start

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.950 
really cool things once again I'll start
off<00:01:51.270> keeping<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.690> very<00:01:51.720> simple

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
off keeping it very simple

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.749 
off keeping it very simple
straightforward<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:53.190> hand<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.400> hand<00:01:53.430> right

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
straightforward to hand to hand right

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:07.600 
straightforward to hand to hand right
left<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.000> left

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.770 

well<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> spoke<00:02:08.729> about<00:02:09.030> earlier<00:02:09.179> about<00:02:09.450> seeing

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
well I spoke about earlier about seeing

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.240 
well I spoke about earlier about seeing
my<00:02:09.869> kids<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.289> shapes<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.860> things<00:02:11.039> as

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
my kids in shapes I see things as

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.490 
my kids in shapes I see things as
triangles<00:02:11.760> or<00:02:11.940> squares<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:13.020> triangles

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
triangles or squares or as triangles

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470 
triangles or squares or as triangles
over<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.160> well<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.520> also<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:15.150> things<00:02:15.360> as

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
over here as well I also see things as

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.570 
over here as well I also see things as
lines<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:15.989> have<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> top<00:02:16.440> line<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.190> symbols

we're all guilty of playing constantly
all<00:02:37.890> over<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.190> kits<00:02:38.489> when<00:02:38.970> we've<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.299> got

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
all over this kits when we've just got

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.509 
all over this kits when we've just got
simple<00:02:39.810> fundamentals<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.560> let's<00:02:41.100> try<00:02:41.310> that

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
simple fundamentals here let's try that

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.759 
simple fundamentals here let's try that
so<00:02:41.730> once<00:02:42.150> again<00:02:42.420> always<00:02:42.660> single<00:02:43.410> strokes<00:02:43.650> to

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
so once again always single strokes to

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.150 
so once again always single strokes to
start<00:02:45.110> fall<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> floor<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.860> going

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
start fall on the floor to get you going

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.560 
start fall on the floor to get you going
and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:47.430> obviously<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.850> out<00:02:47.940> add<00:02:48.090> our<00:02:48.239> Samba

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
and then obviously can out add our Samba

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.030 
and then obviously can out add our Samba
bass<00:02:48.720> drum<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.049> wanted<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.829> let's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
bass drum if you wanted to and let's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.410 
bass drum if you wanted to and let's
start<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> Samba<00:02:50.640> feet<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> single

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
start with a Samba feet and the single

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.870 
start with a Samba feet and the single
strokes<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.410> bar<00:02:52.590> 3<00:02:52.860> 16<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:53.610> start

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
strokes go to a bar 3 16 and then start

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.090 
strokes go to a bar 3 16 and then start
to<00:02:54.000> experiment<00:02:54.600> across<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> line<00:02:55.620> I'll<00:02:55.860> take

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
to experiment across the line I'll take

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.410 
to experiment across the line I'll take
it<00:02:56.220> up<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.370> couple<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.640> BPM<00:02:56.940> as<00:02:57.030> well<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
it up a couple of BPM as well so you can

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.270 
it up a couple of BPM as well so you can
hear<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.750> context<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.799> what<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.070> get

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
hear it in context this is what you get

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:26.450 
hear it in context this is what you get
singles

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.560 

so<00:03:27.460> you<00:03:27.550> only<00:03:27.670> have<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.850> think<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.450> it's

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
so you only have to think but it's

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.760 
so you only have to think but it's
really<00:03:28.780> interesting<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.500> take<00:03:29.650> it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
really interesting we can take it

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.020 
really interesting we can take it
further<00:03:29.980> we<00:03:30.190> can<00:03:30.280> play<00:03:30.460> a<00:03:30.490> bar<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.790> five

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
further we can play a bar of five

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.180 
further we can play a bar of five
sixteen<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:31.960> that'll<00:03:32.140> be<00:03:32.200> right<00:03:32.590> left<00:03:33.010> right

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
sixteen so that'll be right left right

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.070 
sixteen so that'll be right left right
left<00:03:33.550> left<00:03:36.600> once<00:03:37.600> again<00:03:37.840> gives<00:03:38.020> you

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
left left once again gives you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.510 
left left once again gives you
completely<00:03:38.770> completely<00:03:39.580> different<00:03:39.700> texture

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:58.440 

down<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.670> line<00:03:56.580> we<00:03:57.580> can<00:03:57.700> then<00:03:57.820> take<00:03:58.000> seven

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
down the line we can then take seven

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.720 
down the line we can then take seven
sixteen<00:03:58.900> right<00:03:59.500> left<00:03:59.830> right<00:03:59.950> left<00:04:00.130> right<00:04:00.520> left

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
sixteen right left right left right left

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:13.760 
sixteen right left right left right left
left

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.750 

and<00:04:14.770> then<00:04:14.860> we<00:04:14.920> can<00:04:15.040> even<00:04:15.160> play<00:04:15.280> nine<00:04:15.550> if<00:04:15.700> you

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
and then we can even play nine if you

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.790 
and then we can even play nine if you
wanted<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.150> right<00:04:16.630> left<00:04:16.930> right<00:04:17.170> left<00:04:17.320> right

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
wanted to right left right left right

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:33.330 
wanted to right left right left right
left<00:04:17.980> right<00:04:18.459> left<00:04:18.640> right<00:04:19.120> left<00:04:19.299> left<00:04:32.340> once

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.720 
left right left right left left once
again<00:04:33.580> down<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.820> line<00:04:38.190> really<00:04:39.190> really<00:04:39.370> cool

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
again down the line really really cool

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.890 
again down the line really really cool
we<00:04:39.940> can<00:04:40.060> even<00:04:40.270> then<00:04:40.390> put<00:04:40.540> them<00:04:40.660> all<00:04:40.750> together

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
we can even then put them all together

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.650 
we can even then put them all together
