00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
us would be a good start by the way we

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:28.599 
us would be a good start by the way we
have<00:01:16.170> our<00:01:16.380> new<00:01:17.810> spring<00:01:18.810> window<00:01:19.380> yeah<00:01:22.490> pretty

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.990 

so<00:01:29.609> just<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.069> have<00:01:32.069> an<00:01:32.250> idea<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.609> what<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so just want to have an idea of what it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.359 
so just want to have an idea of what it
can<00:01:33.179> do<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.450> far<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.719> focusing<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.979> works<00:01:38.159> out

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
can do as far as focusing that works out

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.630 
can do as far as focusing that works out
pretty<00:01:38.429> well<00:01:38.959> and<00:01:40.459> fall<00:01:41.459> for<00:01:42.200> focus<00:01:43.640> check

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
pretty well and fall for focus check

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.740 
pretty well and fall for focus check
perfect<00:01:45.619> not<00:01:46.619> too<00:01:46.799> good

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
perfect not too good

perfect not too good
reacts<00:01:49.750> very<00:01:49.990> quickly<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.440> my<00:01:53.590> first

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
reacts very quickly this is my first

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.160 
reacts very quickly this is my first
test<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.550> I'm<00:01:54.640> interested<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.210> see<00:01:55.420> what<00:01:55.690> the
