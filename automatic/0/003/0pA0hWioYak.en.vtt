00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.969
 many times video games are the 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:06.970
 escape from the absurd reality that 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.650
 we live today without a doubt the 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.960
 video games are a good source of 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.300
 entertainment but even in games 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.310
 that are given as masterpieces are 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.350
 manages to find a huge source of 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.990
 terror not only being images in 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.240
 screen but also many times they are 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.340
 an auditory source like the sounds 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.060
 some special effects or the 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.470
 soundtrack so today I bring you the 10 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 video game songs more 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.279
 disturbing 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.650
 number 10 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.230
 pokemons has always been and will be one of 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.019
 the most beloved franchises made by 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.300
 nintendo but it has always been involved 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.070
 in trouble a number of causes that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 they have been made a very dark saga 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.420
 gloomy and even tenebrous 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.260
 one of these reasons is the song of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.260
 town band 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.190
 according to the creepy pasta the song 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 original had a little sound waves 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.780
 audible to adult ears in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.150
 change the children if they could hear those 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.520
 low frequencies which made the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.530
 listening to them will cause them fear anxiety 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 terror and will infuse in some cases 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 wishes to commit suicide 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.640
 number 9 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.990
 when you hear Kirby almost always 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.840
 imagine a little rosadito character 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.360
 small and in a circle although 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.850
 be in all its games shapes and sizes 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.259
 there is always a small part of the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.420
 games that is enough 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.509
 frightening enough to appear on a top 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.479
 of terror the terrifying of kyrov and it 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.189
 you can find in many games 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.280
 including the crystal sharp kirby 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.149
 for nintendo 64 at the rifle level 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.149
 star letter cons 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.340
 the music of this level is helped 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.610
 quite because of its gloomy and dark background 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.990
 with lightning and a castle in the background 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.120
 a feeling of terror and despair 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.170
 joe 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.170
 number 8 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.810
 if I would search for everything that trick 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 or the earth bound would never end but 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.490
 as they say, let's start with the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.340
 principle and when I talk about the beginning 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.190
 I sincerely talk about the beginning 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.290
 generally the rpg games start 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 asking you for your name or the name that you 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.820
 you want to give to your player but in the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.890
 bound is different you have to give it 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.220
 name all the players or 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.170
 simply on the button there is kate and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.800
 so the game will put the original name 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.800
 of the player 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.569
 but when you start to name it 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.780
 to the protagonist or is it putting a 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.030
 weird sound like white noise 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.700
 and some voices that seem to many children 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.920
 He is screaming for something while listening 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.380
 how to tune a radio and a voice and 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.390
 lived mind as of the name followed by 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.390
 a quiet background with low sonar 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.840
 surely when you played this part 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.959
 of the game you thought it had broken or 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.819
 I had an error but this is not a 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.630
 of the most grim things that the 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.220
 band 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.280
 number 7 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.680
 Attention if you are sensitive to very 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.440
 dark or dark I recommend you have 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.280
 discretion when watching this video from 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.530
 this point 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.260
 you will usually hear sounds and backgrounds 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.490
 with strange and strange voices be careful 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.490
 if you are scary
