00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.300
 and what's up people this is it we 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.680
 is found today for the video 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.150
 in quotation marks tutorial from 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.619
 the history of the music of the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.690
 martyr who just came out 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.400
 today so I start from the beginning because 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.570
 it is quite difficult to find one's bearings 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.150
 so we open the first door 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 we take the elevator which is located on 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.800
 the left to avoid 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.730
 2 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.650
 pay a door in addition so just to the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.440
 left there you will see a door there 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.060
 will have to open it and then borrowed it 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.920
 will be a room a sort of jewelery 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.410
 at not too much you'll see that's how I 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.380
 ask you there the little teddy so 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 it's the first site you need here 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.770
 will have to take an alley 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 who is on the edge of emptiness not there for the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.489
 big but the little one get there 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.690
 turn right then left 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.430
 in this corridor 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.290
 so there the building upside down 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.820
 there you will see a small hole it will take 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.320
 meet then just turn right 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.100

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.890
 the whole stairwell 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.840
 in eight years of dying stupidly so 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.470
 borrow well but also in addition to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.270
 time to give 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.780

 another concrete pylon that allows us 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.009
 to access another building will require 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.390
