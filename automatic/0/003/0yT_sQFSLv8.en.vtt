it's like having a mini touring car in
your<00:01:58.340> hands

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
your hands

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.440 
your hands
in<00:01:59.830> terms<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.250> handling<00:02:00.610> well<00:02:00.970> for<00:02:01.270> anyone

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
in terms of handling well for anyone

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.510 
in terms of handling well for anyone
that's<00:02:01.690> driven<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:02.080> modern<00:02:02.350> mini<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.950> more

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
that's driven a modern mini it's more

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.050 
that's driven a modern mini it's more
the<00:02:03.700> same<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:06.010> only<00:02:06.159> bad<00:02:06.460> mark<00:02:06.820> is

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the same really and the only bad mark is

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.719 
the same really and the only bad mark is
a<00:02:07.259> suspension<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.440> pretty<00:02:08.860> firm<00:02:09.250> if<00:02:09.640> I'm

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
a suspension it's pretty firm if I'm

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.250 
a suspension it's pretty firm if I'm
going<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.940> be<00:02:10.000> failed<00:02:10.240> roads<00:02:10.539> like<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.990> I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
going to be failed roads like this I

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.410 
going to be failed roads like this I
mean<00:02:11.709> it's<00:02:11.890> fine<00:02:12.100> these<00:02:12.310> are<00:02:12.490> pebble<00:02:13.060> smooth

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
mean it's fine these are pebble smooth

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.449 
mean it's fine these are pebble smooth
and<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.750> flows<00:02:13.990> really<00:02:14.260> nicely<00:02:14.440> with<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and it flows really nicely with the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.730 
and it flows really nicely with the
canvas<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.270> corners<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.380> on<00:02:17.530> bad

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
canvas and the corners but on bad

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.470 
canvas and the corners but on bad
surfaces<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.580> you're<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.000> shaken

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
surfaces where you're going to be shaken

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.449 
surfaces where you're going to be shaken
around<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> cabin<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:21.040> that's<00:02:21.190> another

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
around the cabin and that's another

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.100 
around the cabin and that's another
reason<00:02:21.700> why<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:21.970> probably<00:02:22.330> choose<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.810> Cooper

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
reason why we probably choose the Cooper

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.920 
reason why we probably choose the Cooper
S<00:02:23.260> over<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.740> even<00:02:24.040> stiffer

sharp and despite losing the roof the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.699 
sharp and despite losing the roof the
chassis<00:02:30.850> feels<00:02:31.240> really<00:02:32.050> stiff<00:02:32.320> there's<00:02:32.620> no

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
chassis feels really stiff there's no

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.890

normally associated convertible so you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.180 
normally associated convertible so you
can<00:02:37.270> really<00:02:37.480> check<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.930> around<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
can really check it around and it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.030 
can really check it around and it

huge<00:02:46.510> amounts<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.959> fun

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.890 

the<00:02:49.760> end<00:02:49.880> where<00:02:50.420> we're<00:02:50.540> going<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.750> to

is<00:02:56.510> still<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.170> more<00:02:57.350> pure<00:02:57.680> drivers<00:02:58.580> car<00:02:58.790> but

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
is still the more pure drivers car but

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.450 
is still the more pure drivers car but
not<00:02:59.060> by<00:02:59.270> much<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.500> mini<00:03:00.710> because<00:03:01.310> it's

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
not by much and the mini because it's

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.400 
not by much and the mini because it's
