hi<00:00:05.250> I'm<00:00:05.490> here<00:00:05.670> today<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> introduce<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
hi I'm here today to introduce you to

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.320 
hi I'm here today to introduce you to
close-up<00:00:07.950> photography<00:00:08.309> otherwise<00:00:09.000> known<00:00:09.300> as

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
close-up photography otherwise known as

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.959 
close-up photography otherwise known as
macro<00:00:10.080> photography<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.950> what<00:00:11.670> we're<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.849> to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
macro photography so what we're going to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.850 
macro photography so what we're going to
introduce<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.450> today<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.049> different<00:00:13.440> ways

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
introduce you to today is different ways

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.519 
introduce you to today is different ways
of<00:00:14.219> letting<00:00:14.370> your<00:00:14.580> digital<00:00:15.000> SLR<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:16.080> closer

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
of letting your digital SLR get closer

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.620 
of letting your digital SLR get closer
to<00:00:16.770> things<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:18.240> thing<00:00:18.390> we're<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.570> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
to things so first thing we're going to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.540 
to things so first thing we're going to
look<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.590> least<00:00:19.980> expensive<00:00:20.130> option

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
look at is the least expensive option

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.570 
look at is the least expensive option
and<00:00:20.910> these<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:22.109> set<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.680> clothes<00:00:23.369> up

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and these are a set of clothes up

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.089 
and these are a set of clothes up
filters<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.230> normal<00:00:25.560> ordinary

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
filters so just like normal ordinary

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460 
filters so just like normal ordinary
protection<00:00:26.820> filters<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.480> polarizing<00:00:28.080> filters

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
protection filters in polarizing filters

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.230 
protection filters in polarizing filters
and<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.490> screw<00:00:29.699> them<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> front<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and you just screw them on the front of

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
and you just screw them on the front of
your<00:00:30.330> lens<00:00:30.480> they<00:00:30.720> come<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.260> sizes<00:00:31.830> appropriate

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
your lens they come in sizes appropriate

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
your lens they come in sizes appropriate
to<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.020> example<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.620> you've<00:00:34.739> got<00:00:34.920> one

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
to that so for example if you've got one

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.370 
to that so for example if you've got one
of<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.250> cannon<00:00:35.760> kit<00:00:36.030> lenses<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> 18<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> 55

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
of these cannon kit lenses the 18 to 55

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.110 
of these cannon kit lenses the 18 to 55
so<00:00:37.829> you'll<00:00:37.950> need<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> set<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> filters<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.059> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so you'll need a set of filters that are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.740 
so you'll need a set of filters that are
fifty<00:00:39.629> eight<00:00:39.750> millimeters<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.500> diameter<00:00:40.680> now

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
fifty eight millimeters in diameter now

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.389 
fifty eight millimeters in diameter now
when<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> buy<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> set<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> these<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:43.770> come<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
when you buy a set of these they come in

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
when you buy a set of these they come in
different<00:00:44.850> strengths<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.170> example<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
different strengths so for example this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
different strengths so for example this
set<00:00:47.010> I've<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.670> comes<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> plus<00:00:48.719> one

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
set I've got here comes as a plus one

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.220 
set I've got here comes as a plus one
plus<00:00:49.710> two<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.640> plus<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.629> plus<00:00:51.899> four<00:00:52.199> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
plus two and a plus for the plus four is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.760 
plus two and a plus for the plus four is
the<00:00:52.530> strongest<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.280> those<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the strongest of those now if we for

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
the strongest of those now if we for
example<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.489> lens<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> said<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
example with this lens if I said it to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.770 
example with this lens if I said it to
55<00:00:57.840> millimeters<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:59.160> focus<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.090> close<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.690> i

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
55 millimeters and I focus as close as i

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.070 
55 millimeters and I focus as close as i
can<00:01:00.840> i<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:05.220> distance<00:01:06.080> just

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
can i can get down to this distance just

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
can i can get down to this distance just
here<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.310> quite<00:01:08.549> close<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> standard

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
here which is quite close for a standard

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.800 
here which is quite close for a standard
lens<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.890> example<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.460> i<00:01:11.610> stick<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.150> my

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
lens but for example if i stick on my

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
lens but for example if i stick on my
plus<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.619> close-up<00:01:14.250> filter<00:01:14.580> i'll<00:01:15.000> show<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
plus for close-up filter i'll show you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.530 
plus for close-up filter i'll show you
what<00:01:15.570> happens<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.820> screw<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
what happens so all we do is screw that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
what happens so all we do is screw that
on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.810> front<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.549> am<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on the front like so and now am I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.630 
on the front like so and now am I
minimum<00:01:21.479> focusing<00:01:21.900> distance<00:01:21.960> i<00:01:22.439> am<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:23.070> down

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
minimum focusing distance i am now down

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.590 
minimum focusing distance i am now down
to<00:01:24.200> there<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.680> i<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:26.790> get<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.299> closer

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
to there so i can now get much closer

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.620 
to there so i can now get much closer
than<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.990> could<00:01:28.170> before<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.880> can<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.030> stack

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
than I could before I can also stack

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
than I could before I can also stack
these<00:01:30.960> filters<00:01:31.290> together<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
these filters together so if I was to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
these filters together so if I was to
put<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.509> three<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.020> these<00:01:34.200> filters<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
put all three of these filters on it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.640 
put all three of these filters on it
would<00:01:35.280> allow<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.210> extremely<00:01:37.020> close

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.230 

now<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:40.920> down<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:43.790> stick<00:01:44.790> those<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> get

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
now I'm down to this stick those to get

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170 
now I'm down to this stick those to get
in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> much<00:01:45.810> closer<00:01:46.110> again<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.670> closest

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
in a much closer again so the closest

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.520 
in a much closer again so the closest
you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.659> by<00:01:48.810> stacking<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.259> together

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you can get is by stacking them together

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590 
you can get is by stacking them together
the<00:01:50.070> catch<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.790> stacking<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.329> filters

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the catch with stacking these filters

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
the catch with stacking these filters
together<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.740> doesn't<00:01:53.250> improve<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
together is that it doesn't improve the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
together is that it doesn't improve the
sharpness<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> overall<00:01:54.930> image<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.409> you're

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
sharpness of the overall image so you're

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.270 
sharpness of the overall image so you're
adding<00:01:56.549> glass<00:01:56.790> ceilings<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.070> you're<00:01:59.070> not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
adding glass ceilings and you're not

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
adding glass ceilings and you're not
necessarily<00:01:59.850> improving<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> quality<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
necessarily improving the quality of the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
necessarily improving the quality of the
lens<00:02:01.649> you've<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.579> allowing<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
lens you've got your just allowing it to

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.389 
lens you've got your just allowing it to
focus<00:02:03.570> closer<00:02:03.960> you'll<00:02:04.710> also<00:02:04.890> find<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
focus closer you'll also find that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.230 
focus closer you'll also find that
you'll<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> color

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you'll get a little bit of color

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.819 
you'll get a little bit of color
aberration<00:02:06.780> or<00:02:06.840> fringing<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.619> side

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
aberration or fringing around side

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.430 
aberration or fringing around side
around<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> edges<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.849> things<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.450> overall

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
around the edges of things so overall

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.500 
around the edges of things so overall
optically<00:02:11.039> they're<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.730> perfect<00:02:12.030> thing

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
optically they're not the perfect thing

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.640 
optically they're not the perfect thing
that<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.930> give

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that they do give

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.309 
that they do give
you<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> ability<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.430> focus<00:02:14.700> close<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.079> they

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
you the ability to focus close and they

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.809 
you the ability to focus close and they
can<00:02:16.349> produce<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:17.129> nice<00:02:17.250> results<00:02:17.700> we've

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
can produce really nice results we've

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.190 
can produce really nice results we've
seen<00:02:18.000> some<00:02:18.150> really<00:02:18.329> good<00:02:18.510> results<00:02:18.720> done<00:02:19.110> on

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
seen some really good results done on

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.479 
seen some really good results done on
these<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.379> they're<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> great<00:02:19.980> way<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.459> to

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
these and they're a great way for you to

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.780 
these and they're a great way for you to
try<00:02:20.909> macro<00:02:21.390> photography<00:02:21.739> without<00:02:22.739> spending<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
try macro photography without spending a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.300 
try macro photography without spending a
lot<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:23.939> money<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.709> second<00:02:26.129> option

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
lot of money so the second option

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
lot of money so the second option
analyst<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:28.290> go<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:29.400> set<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.060> extension

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
analyst is to go to a set of extension

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.470 
analyst is to go to a set of extension
tubes<00:02:31.319> now<00:02:31.700> extension<00:02:32.700> tubes<00:02:32.939> are<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.329> like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
tubes now extension tubes are just like

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.630 
tubes now extension tubes are just like
what<00:02:33.629> they<00:02:33.720> sound<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.019> they're<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.890> true<00:02:35.340> no

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
what they sound like they're a true no

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460 
what they sound like they're a true no
glass<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.180> middle<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:36.359> it<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.049> it's

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
glass in the middle of it so it's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.190 
glass in the middle of it so it's
something<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:38.189> you<00:02:38.220> fit<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.879> between<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
something that you fit in between the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.580 
something that you fit in between the
lens<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.220> body<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.849> take<00:02:42.060> lens<00:02:42.239> off

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
lens and the body so you take lens off

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.839 
lens and the body so you take lens off
you<00:02:43.640> attach<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:46.440> between<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.730> can

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
you attach this in between and you can

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.580 
you attach this in between and you can
attach<00:02:48.150> often<00:02:48.659> they<00:02:48.750> come<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.109> set<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.379> three

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
attach often they come as a set of three

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.819 
attach often they come as a set of three
and<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.180> attach<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:52.200> three<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.709> them

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
and and you can attach all three of them

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.080 
and and you can attach all three of them
at<00:02:52.920> once<00:02:53.040> if<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.849> more<00:02:54.060> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
at once if you want to the more you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.110 
at once if you want to the more you
attach<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.569> closer<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.889> so<00:02:56.639> now

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
attach the closer you can get so now

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.780 
attach the closer you can get so now
with<00:02:57.389> those<00:02:57.599> three<00:02:57.840> tubes<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.439> I<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.489> get

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
with those three tubes on I can now get

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.979 
with those three tubes on I can now get
down<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:01.010> almost<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.609> top<00:03:02.939> of<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.299> subjects<00:03:03.810> so

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
down to almost on top of my subjects so

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.589 
down to almost on top of my subjects so
that's<00:03:04.549> significantly<00:03:05.549> closer<00:03:05.909> than<00:03:06.299> i<00:03:06.389> was

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
that's significantly closer than i was

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.170 
that's significantly closer than i was
getting<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:06.959> my<00:03:07.079> close<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.319> filters<00:03:07.739> now<00:03:08.639> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
getting with my close up filters now the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.399 
getting with my close up filters now the
catch<00:03:09.599> with<00:03:09.930> these<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:12.200> when<00:03:13.200> you're

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
catch with these is that when you're

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.190 
catch with these is that when you're
looking<00:03:13.439> down<00:03:13.889> a<00:03:14.189> long<00:03:14.579> tube<00:03:15.060> you're<00:03:15.930> letting

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
looking down a long tube you're letting

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.990 
looking down a long tube you're letting
in<00:03:16.530> less<00:03:16.829> light<00:03:17.129> than<00:03:17.159> when<00:03:17.699> you're<00:03:17.819> looking

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
in less light than when you're looking

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.270 
in less light than when you're looking
down<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.209> short<00:03:18.510> tube<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:19.919> looking

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
down a short tube so just like looking

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.430 
down a short tube so just like looking
down<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.819> tube<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.419> vacuum<00:03:21.569> cleaner<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
down the tube of the vacuum cleaner the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.930 
down the tube of the vacuum cleaner the
longer<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.949> the<00:03:23.220> less<00:03:23.370> light<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.879> see

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
longer it is the less light you can see

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.449 
longer it is the less light you can see
at<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.209> inn<00:03:24.419> so<00:03:24.750> when<00:03:25.349> we<00:03:25.470> stack<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> whole<00:03:26.190> set

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
at the inn so when we stack a whole set

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.890 
at the inn so when we stack a whole set
of<00:03:26.549> tubes<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:27.000> between<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.480> body<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
of tubes in between the body and the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.809 
of tubes in between the body and the
lens<00:03:28.109> like<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:28.889> getting<00:03:29.250> darker

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
lens like that it's getting darker

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
lens like that it's getting darker
there's<00:03:30.150> less<00:03:30.389> light<00:03:30.419> reaching<00:03:31.169> our<00:03:31.319> sensor

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
there's less light reaching our sensor

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.129 
there's less light reaching our sensor
inside<00:03:31.949> our<00:03:32.129> camera<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.909> the<00:03:33.449> shutter<00:03:33.810> speeds

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
inside our camera so the shutter speeds

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.270 
inside our camera so the shutter speeds
that<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.409> camera<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.889> have<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.129> use

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
that your camera is going to have to use

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.949 
that your camera is going to have to use
to<00:03:35.489> give<00:03:35.639> correct<00:03:35.909> exposure<00:03:36.269> are<00:03:36.659> going<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> be

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
to give correct exposure are going to be

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.220 
to give correct exposure are going to be
longer<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.310> involves<00:03:39.060> men<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.599> using<00:03:40.169> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
longer so that involves men and using a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.170 
longer so that involves men and using a
tripod<00:03:40.440> essentially<00:03:41.129> there's<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:41.790> very

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
tripod essentially there's it's very

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.300 
tripod essentially there's it's very
very<00:03:42.540> difficult<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:43.199> handhold<00:03:43.739> with<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.129> city

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
very difficult to handhold with the city

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
very difficult to handhold with the city
of<00:03:44.370> these<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.699> you're<00:03:45.479> going<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.810> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
of these and you're going to have to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.780 
of these and you're going to have to
have<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> really<00:03:46.379> good<00:03:46.500> sturdy<00:03:46.949> tripod<00:03:47.340> which

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
have a really good sturdy tripod which

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.990 
have a really good sturdy tripod which
I'd<00:03:47.940> recommend<00:03:48.209> for<00:03:48.569> close-up<00:03:48.900> work<00:03:49.019> anyway

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
I'd recommend for close-up work anyway

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.849 
I'd recommend for close-up work anyway
the<00:03:51.000> neat<00:03:51.180> thing<00:03:51.209> about<00:03:51.449> them<00:03:51.840> versus<00:03:52.470> tubes

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
the neat thing about them versus tubes

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.330 
the neat thing about them versus tubes
is<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.819> they<00:03:54.540> aren't<00:03:55.079> adding<00:03:55.680> any<00:03:55.829> glass<00:03:56.040> so

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
is that they aren't adding any glass so

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
is that they aren't adding any glass so
the<00:03:56.459> quality<00:03:56.849> of<00:03:57.120> your<00:03:57.329> existing<00:03:58.019> lens<00:03:58.229> is

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
maintained you can also use them in

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.149 
maintained you can also use them in
conjunction<00:04:01.019> with<00:04:01.139> any<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> lenses<00:04:02.010> that

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
conjunction with any of the lenses that

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.619

you have because the mount on the back

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.140 
you have because the mount on the back
is<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.930> same<00:04:04.169> so<00:04:04.859> great<00:04:05.699> for<00:04:05.879> getting<00:04:06.000> up

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
is the same so great for getting up

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.180 
is the same so great for getting up

instance<00:05:04.880> this<00:05:05.240> little<00:05:05.480> cannon<00:05:05.750> here<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.110> you

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
instance this little cannon here and you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.660 
instance this little cannon here and you
can<00:05:06.860> actually<00:05:06.950> take<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.190> photograph<00:05:07.400> of

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
can actually take a photograph of

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.590 
can actually take a photograph of
something<00:05:07.880> slightly<00:05:08.150> smaller<00:05:08.800> now<00:05:10.540> why<00:05:11.540> would

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
something slightly smaller now why would

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.710 
something slightly smaller now why would
you<00:05:12.080> buy<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.830> 50<00:05:13.250> millimeter<00:05:13.550> or<00:05:14.210> why<00:05:14.480> would<00:05:14.660> you

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
you buy a 50 millimeter or why would you

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.120 
you buy a 50 millimeter or why would you
spend<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:14.990> little<00:05:15.080> bit<00:05:15.200> more<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.590> buy<00:05:15.710> 100

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
spend a little bit more and buy 100

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.070 
spend a little bit more and buy 100
millimeter<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:17.000> key<00:05:17.270> difference<00:05:17.300> between

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
millimeter the key difference between

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.380 
millimeter the key difference between
these<00:05:18.260> two<00:05:18.320> lenses<00:05:18.890> is<00:05:19.100> how<00:05:19.550> close<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.210> have

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
these two lenses is how close you have

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.050 
these two lenses is how close you have
to<00:05:20.540> be<00:05:20.720> for<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.140> magnification<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.280> with<00:05:22.940> the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
to be for that magnification so with the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.600 
to be for that magnification so with the
50<00:05:23.390> ml<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.810> says<00:05:24.230> I<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.590> minimum<00:05:25.220> focusing

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
50 ml it says I the minimum focusing

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.640 
50 ml it says I the minimum focusing
distance<00:05:25.670> is<00:05:26.120> 20<00:05:26.390> centimeters<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.470> means

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
distance is 20 centimeters so that means

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.640 
distance is 20 centimeters so that means
at<00:05:27.920> maximum<00:05:28.490> magnification<00:05:28.730> I<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.900> thus<00:05:30.380> far

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
at maximum magnification I and thus far

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.080 
at maximum magnification I and thus far
away<00:05:31.300> when<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:32.570> put<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.550> 100<00:05:34.550> millimeter<00:05:34.910> on

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
away when I put the 100 millimeter on

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.320 
away when I put the 100 millimeter on
the<00:05:35.720> minimum<00:05:36.490> focusing<00:05:37.490> distance<00:05:37.550> for<00:05:38.180> this

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
the minimum focusing distance for this

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.760 
the minimum focusing distance for this
lens<00:05:38.630> which<00:05:39.050> gives<00:05:39.320> me<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.470> same

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
lens which gives me the same

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.560 
lens which gives me the same
magnification<00:05:40.250> as<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.030> does<00:05:41.180> for<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.480> other

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
magnification as it does for the other

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.390 
magnification as it does for the other
lens<00:05:41.810> is<00:05:43.030> 35<00:05:44.030> centimeters<00:05:44.720> so<00:05:45.650> break<00:05:46.190> that<00:05:46.370> up

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
lens is 35 centimeters so break that up

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.590 
lens is 35 centimeters so break that up
and<00:05:46.850> now<00:05:47.330> we<00:05:48.080> are<00:05:48.320> this<00:05:49.190> far<00:05:49.220> away<00:05:49.760> and<00:05:50.060> the

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
and now we are this far away and the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.740 
and now we are this far away and the
size<00:05:51.200> of<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.470> picture<00:05:51.680> is<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:51.920> same<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:53.060> the

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
size of the picture is the same so the

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.020 
size of the picture is the same so the
key<00:05:54.020> difference<00:05:54.410> there<00:05:54.590> is<00:05:54.950> that<00:05:55.370> my<00:05:55.550> working

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
key difference there is that my working

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.090 
key difference there is that my working
distance<00:05:56.420> is<00:05:56.600> improved<00:05:57.050> so<00:05:57.410> I'm<00:05:57.500> further<00:05:57.890> away

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
distance is improved so I'm further away

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.760 
distance is improved so I'm further away
same<00:05:58.940> photograph<00:05:59.390> the<00:06:00.080> advantage<00:06:00.560> with<00:06:00.740> this

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
same photograph the advantage with this

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.860 
same photograph the advantage with this
is<00:06:01.070> is<00:06:01.310> if<00:06:01.610> you're<00:06:01.760> in<00:06:01.850> a<00:06:01.880> situation<00:06:02.120> where

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
is is if you're in a situation where

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.320 
is is if you're in a situation where
you're<00:06:03.530> blocking<00:06:04.190> the<00:06:04.400> light<00:06:04.640> for<00:06:05.060> instance

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
you're blocking the light for instance

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.060 
you're blocking the light for instance
you're<00:06:05.570> you're<00:06:05.870> casting<00:06:06.320> a<00:06:06.380> shadow<00:06:06.410> over<00:06:06.770> your

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
you're you're casting a shadow over your

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.040 
you're you're casting a shadow over your
subject<00:06:07.460> it's<00:06:07.880> really<00:06:08.300> good<00:06:08.600> if<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:08.810> can<00:06:08.930> get

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
subject it's really good if you can get

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.240 
subject it's really good if you can get
a<00:06:09.080> little<00:06:09.200> bit<00:06:09.380> further<00:06:09.650> away<00:06:09.770> so<00:06:09.920> you<00:06:10.220> don't

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
a little bit further away so you don't

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.070 
a little bit further away so you don't
do<00:06:10.550> that<00:06:10.730> the<00:06:11.210> other<00:06:11.330> thing<00:06:11.600> is<00:06:11.630> if<00:06:11.960> you're

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
do that the other thing is if you're

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.840 
do that the other thing is if you're
taking<00:06:12.230> photographs<00:06:12.560> of<00:06:12.860> bugs<00:06:13.160> or<00:06:13.460> live

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.920 
objects or live subjects you're working
distances<00:06:16.460> improved<00:06:16.880> so<00:06:17.150> you're<00:06:17.690> less<00:06:17.900> likely

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
distances improved so you're less likely

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.250 
distances improved so you're less likely
to<00:06:18.320> scare<00:06:18.710> them<00:06:18.830> away<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:20.570> key<00:06:20.810> to<00:06:20.930> remember

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
to scare them away the key to remember

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.530 
to scare them away the key to remember
when<00:06:21.410> they<00:06:21.560> quote<00:06:21.890> these<00:06:22.160> these<00:06:22.670> 35

terms<00:06:25.550> is<00:06:25.880> that<00:06:26.510> they<00:06:26.660> measure<00:06:26.990> it<00:06:27.290> not<00:06:27.650> from

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
terms is that they measure it not from

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.920 
terms is that they measure it not from
the<00:06:28.040> front<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.490> lens<00:06:28.670> but<00:06:29.150> from<00:06:29.630> the

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 
subjects so and it

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.729 
subjects so and it
is<00:06:35.309> not<00:06:35.909> quite<00:06:36.329> as<00:06:36.629> much<00:06:36.779> room<00:06:37.139> as<00:06:37.379> you<00:06:37.559> might

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:37.739 
is not quite as much room as you might

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:39.969 
is not quite as much room as you might
expect<00:06:37.859> from<00:06:38.309> what<00:06:38.519> they<00:06:38.639> state<00:06:38.879> on<00:06:39.059> the<00:06:39.179> lens

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
expect from what they state on the lens

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.109 
expect from what they state on the lens
one<00:06:40.979> of<00:06:41.099> the<00:06:41.189> new<00:06:41.369> things<00:06:41.399> that's<00:06:41.849> come<00:06:41.999> about

00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:42.119 
one of the new things that's come about

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.579 
one of the new things that's come about
just<00:06:42.449> recently<00:06:42.839> and<00:06:43.019> some<00:06:43.199> of<00:06:43.289> the<00:06:43.349> brands

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
just recently and some of the brands

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:45.319 
just recently and some of the brands
they've<00:06:43.799> updated<00:06:43.949> their<00:06:44.369> macro<00:06:44.669> lenses<00:06:45.059> and

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:45.329 
they've updated their macro lenses and

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:47.839 
they've updated their macro lenses and
they<00:06:45.809> now<00:06:46.079> make<00:06:46.379> internal<00:06:46.979> focusing<00:06:47.549> models

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
they now make internal focusing models

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.119 
they now make internal focusing models
so<00:06:48.059> rather<00:06:48.809> than<00:06:49.139> a<00:06:49.199> lens<00:06:49.439> like<00:06:49.529> this<00:06:49.649> that

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:50.129 
so rather than a lens like this that

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:51.769 
so rather than a lens like this that
when<00:06:50.309> you're<00:06:50.429> focusing<00:06:50.909> it<00:06:51.149> changes<00:06:51.629> in

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:51.779 
when you're focusing it changes in

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.989 
when you're focusing it changes in
length<00:06:52.019> the<00:06:52.289> some<00:06:53.219> of<00:06:53.309> the<00:06:53.369> new<00:06:53.519> Canon<00:06:53.909> and

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:53.999 
length the some of the new Canon and

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.989 
length the some of the new Canon and
Nikon<00:06:54.059> ones<00:06:54.539> now<00:06:54.959> focus<00:06:55.559> internally<00:06:56.189> so<00:06:56.429> when

00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:56.999 
Nikon ones now focus internally so when

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.639 
Nikon ones now focus internally so when
you<00:06:57.089> get<00:06:57.239> up<00:06:57.329> closer<00:06:57.599> it<00:06:57.899> doesn't<00:06:58.259> change<00:06:58.469> the

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:58.649 
you get up closer it doesn't change the

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:00.199 
you get up closer it doesn't change the
length<00:06:58.889> of<00:06:59.069> the<00:06:59.189> lens<00:06:59.369> which<00:06:59.639> gives<00:06:59.849> you<00:06:59.939> just

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:00.209 
length of the lens which gives you just

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:01.789 
length of the lens which gives you just
a<00:07:00.359> little<00:07:00.599> bit<00:07:00.719> more<00:07:00.899> working<00:07:01.289> room<00:07:01.319> again

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:01.799 
a little bit more working room again

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:05.869 
a little bit more working room again
which<00:07:02.759> is<00:07:02.909> quite<00:07:03.149> nice<00:07:04.189> so<00:07:05.189> to<00:07:05.309> recap<00:07:05.489> we've

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 
which is quite nice so to recap we've

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.429 
which is quite nice so to recap we've
got<00:07:06.029> three<00:07:06.299> different<00:07:06.569> ways<00:07:06.719> to<00:07:06.749> get<00:07:06.989> close-up

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:07.439 
got three different ways to get close-up

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.909 
got three different ways to get close-up
we<00:07:07.769> can<00:07:08.129> use<00:07:08.669> a<00:07:08.699> set<00:07:08.999> of<00:07:09.089> clothes<00:07:09.239> up<00:07:09.419> filters

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
we can use a set of clothes up filters

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.259 
we can use a set of clothes up filters
which<00:07:10.919> will<00:07:11.159> allow<00:07:11.279> us<00:07:11.429> to<00:07:11.610> get<00:07:11.819> really<00:07:12.029> close

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:12.269 
which will allow us to get really close

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:15.559 
which will allow us to get really close
and<00:07:12.589> they're<00:07:13.589> relatively<00:07:14.039> inexpensive<00:07:14.669> we

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569 
and they're relatively inexpensive we

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.600 
and they're relatively inexpensive we
can<00:07:15.719> go<00:07:15.899> to<00:07:15.959> a<00:07:16.229> set<00:07:16.469> of<00:07:16.559> extension<00:07:17.129> tubes<00:07:17.399> and

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
can go to a set of extension tubes and

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.909 
can go to a set of extension tubes and
these<00:07:18.119> fit<00:07:18.389> between<00:07:18.629> the<00:07:19.049> body<00:07:19.199> and<00:07:19.349> the<00:07:19.619> lens

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
these fit between the body and the lens

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.769 
these fit between the body and the lens
and<00:07:20.129> these<00:07:20.309> also<00:07:20.489> let<00:07:20.849> us<00:07:20.939> get<00:07:21.059> very<00:07:21.239> close<00:07:21.389> but

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:21.779 
and these also let us get very close but

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.679 
and these also let us get very close but
they<00:07:21.959> don't<00:07:22.110> live<00:07:22.259> as<00:07:22.349> much<00:07:22.499> licen<00:07:22.889> and

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:23.689 
they don't live as much licen and

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.879 
they don't live as much licen and
optically<00:07:24.689> the<00:07:24.929> best<00:07:25.110> solution<00:07:25.529> is<00:07:25.619> to<00:07:25.679> buy

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:25.889 
optically the best solution is to buy

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:27.799 
optically the best solution is to buy
