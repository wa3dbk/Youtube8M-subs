we<00:00:06.570> have<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> trail<00:00:07.050> here<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:08.400> ran<00:00:08.610> parallel

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
we have a trail here that ran parallel

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.120 
we have a trail here that ran parallel
to<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.990> creek<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.500> now<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.860> has<00:00:10.950> been

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
to the creek and now it has been

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
to the creek and now it has been
overtaken<00:00:11.520> by<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.850> green<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.780> we've<00:00:12.900> got

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
overtaken by the green but we've got

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.770 
overtaken by the green but we've got
like<00:00:13.889> an<00:00:14.190> eroded<00:00:14.660> silty<00:00:15.660> cliff<00:00:16.250> about<00:00:17.600> 10<00:00:18.600> feet

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
like an eroded silty cliff about 10 feet

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.689 
like an eroded silty cliff about 10 feet
deep<00:00:18.840> that's<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.710> eating<00:00:20.310> away<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
deep that's just eating away at the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.670 
deep that's just eating away at the
trail<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:21.750> continue<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.500> at

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
trail and it will continue to do so at

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
trail and it will continue to do so at
any<00:00:22.770> high<00:00:23.010> water<00:00:23.280> event<00:00:23.640> definitely<00:00:24.540> not<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
any high water event definitely not a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.420 
any high water event definitely not a
place<00:00:25.200> where<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.560> walk<00:00:25.860> anymore<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
place where we can walk anymore and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.350 
place where we can walk anymore and
we're<00:00:26.550> not<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> want<00:00:26.940> to<00:00:27.030> walk<00:00:27.180> it's

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
we're not going to want to walk it's

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.780 
we're not going to want to walk it's
really<00:00:27.600> very<00:00:28.080> close<00:00:28.350> to<00:00:28.530> it<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.800> an<00:00:29.340> unstable

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
really very close to it all an unstable

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.910 
really very close to it all an unstable
ground<00:00:30.360> they're<00:00:31.110> built<00:00:31.320> along<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.590> creek

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
ground they're built along the creek

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520 
ground they're built along the creek
because<00:00:32.340> people<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> creek

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
because people like to go to the creek

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.630 
because people like to go to the creek
but<00:00:34.530> we're<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> try<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.039> come<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
but we're going to try to come up with a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
but we're going to try to come up with a
more<00:00:35.760> sustainable<00:00:36.090> solution<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.440> case

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
more sustainable solution in this case

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.189 
more sustainable solution in this case
our<00:00:37.980> trail<00:00:38.489> will<00:00:38.699> be<00:00:38.850> much<00:00:39.690> further<00:00:39.899> away<00:00:40.079> from

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
our trail will be much further away from

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.540 
our trail will be much further away from
the<00:00:40.440> creek<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.129> still<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> have

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the creek but we're still going to have

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.939 
the creek but we're still going to have
access<00:00:41.850> points<00:00:42.449> for<00:00:43.289> people<00:00:43.499> to<00:00:43.589> use<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
access points for people to use the

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.369 
access points for people to use the
Creekside<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.719> possible<00:00:45.960> now

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Creekside these are more possible now

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.649 
Creekside these are more possible now
for<00:00:46.679> a<00:00:46.710> while<00:00:46.769> there<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.489> water<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
for a while there the water was all the

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.419 
for a while there the water was all the
way<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.079> level<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.589> bridges<00:00:49.800> last

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
way up to the level of the bridges last

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.520 
way up to the level of the bridges last
week<00:00:50.729> we<00:00:50.940> could<00:00:51.089> we<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> only<00:00:51.629> access<00:00:52.109> certain

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
week we could we can only access certain

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
week we could we can only access certain
points<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> park<00:00:53.249> we've<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.969> some<00:00:54.179> ruts

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
points of the park we've got some ruts

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959 
points of the park we've got some ruts
that<00:00:54.659> 100<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.350> 200<00:00:55.710> feet<00:00:55.800> long<00:00:56.069> there's<00:00:56.819> some

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that 100 and 200 feet long there's some

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.209 
that 100 and 200 feet long there's some
pockets<00:00:57.359> where<00:00:57.539> those<00:00:57.659> holes<00:00:58.010> about<00:00:59.010> three

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
pockets where those holes about three

pockets where those holes about three
feet<00:00:59.399> deep<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.940> there's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> decent<00:01:00.269> amount<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
of time in the open space so you know it

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.070 
of time in the open space so you know it
seemed<00:01:46.100> like<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> great<00:01:46.700> way<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.000> try<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:47.900> get<00:01:48.020> a

seemed like a great way to try and get a
little<00:01:48.290> bit<00:01:48.380> back<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.860> figured<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.310> was<00:01:49.400> a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
little bit back and figured it was a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.130 
little bit back and figured it was a
great<00:01:49.640> opportunity<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.270> give<00:01:50.420> back<00:01:50.450> after<00:01:51.050> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
great opportunity to give back after the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.140 
great opportunity to give back after the
storm<00:01:51.380> system<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.770> came<00:01:51.979> through<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.940> creek

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
storm system that came through the creek

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.980 
storm system that came through the creek
had<00:01:53.300> kind<00:01:53.510> of<00:01:53.540> come<00:01:53.720> through<00:01:53.900> here<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.290> and

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
had kind of come through here and and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.510 
had kind of come through here and and
rerouted<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.110> most<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.680> trail<00:01:57.920> in

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
rerouted the most of the trail in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.130 
rerouted the most of the trail in
through<00:01:58.729> this<00:01:58.850> section<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.570> looking<00:01:59.930> to<00:01:59.990> build

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
through this section so looking to build

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.170 
through this section so looking to build
up<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.320> trail<00:02:00.590> bed<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.800> little<00:02:00.979> bit<00:02:01.100> level<00:02:02.090> out

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
up the trail bed a little bit level out

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.850 
up the trail bed a little bit level out
the<00:02:02.210> surface<00:02:02.750> get<00:02:03.080> ready<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.320> do<00:02:03.470> some<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the surface get ready to do some of the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.340 
the surface get ready to do some of the
heavier<00:02:04.610> machinery<00:02:05.150> work<00:02:05.420> but<00:02:05.720> improve<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
heavier machinery work but improve the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.960 
heavier machinery work but improve the
trail<00:02:06.530> temporarily<00:02:07.010> for<00:02:07.310> now<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.610> mean<00:02:07.880> we

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
trail temporarily for now I mean we

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.030 
trail temporarily for now I mean we
definitely<00:02:08.090> moved<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.720> lot<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.320> dirt<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.709> lot<00:02:09.890> of

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
definitely moved a lot of dirt a lot of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.400 
definitely moved a lot of dirt a lot of
sand<00:02:10.250> moved<00:02:10.730> a<00:02:10.880> lot<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.330> dirt<00:02:11.570> definitely<00:02:12.260> was

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
sand moved a lot of dirt definitely was

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.350 
sand moved a lot of dirt definitely was
able<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.709> clean<00:02:12.890> up<00:02:13.040> some<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.400> trail<00:02:13.670> cover

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
able to clean up some of the trail cover

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.790 
able to clean up some of the trail cover
up<00:02:14.510> some<00:02:14.690> roots<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> some<00:02:15.170> rocks<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.620> shored

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
up some roots and some rocks and shored

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.220 
up some roots and some rocks and shored
up<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.070> bit<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:17.300> think<00:02:17.600> hopefully<00:02:17.720> our

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
up a bit and I think hopefully our

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.229 
up a bit and I think hopefully our
effort<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.800> kind<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.370> pave<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> way<00:02:20.150> for

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
effort so kind of pave the way for

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.510 
effort so kind of pave the way for
opening<00:02:20.690> up<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:20.989> park<00:02:21.290> into<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.100> fall<00:02:22.340> so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
opening up this park into the fall so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.600 
opening up this park into the fall so
people<00:02:22.760> come<00:02:22.880> out<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.060> use<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.450> bit
