big wall with vines and stuff and you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
big wall with vines and stuff and you
got<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.880> climb<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.240> every<00:00:30.449> single<00:00:30.570> time<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
got to climb it every single time and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.810 
got to climb it every single time and
I'm<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.619> speed<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> climbing<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.669> else

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
I'm gonna speed up the climbing or else

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940 
I'm gonna speed up the climbing or else
it<00:00:33.000> would<00:00:33.090> add<00:00:33.270> three<00:00:33.750> wasted<00:00:34.380> minutes<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it would add three wasted minutes to the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.090 
it would add three wasted minutes to the
video<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.840> want<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.890> kind<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
video so I just want to that's kind of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.209 
video so I just want to that's kind of
funny<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
funny you just want to get up here and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
funny you just want to get up here and
there's<00:00:41.940> two<00:00:42.239> open<00:00:43.170> platforms<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> one

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
there's two open platforms and one

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500 
there's two open platforms and one
closed<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> jump<00:00:45.329> off<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
closed one and you have to jump off of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.610 
closed one and you have to jump off of
each<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.140> once<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:47.420> death<00:00:48.420> will<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
each of them once now death will kind of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.439 
each of them once now death will kind of
get<00:00:49.860> halfway<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.610> ground<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> start

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
get halfway to the ground and start

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.970 
get halfway to the ground and start
diving<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.989> its<00:00:52.110> own<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.379> there's<00:00:52.500> no<00:00:52.649> buttons

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
diving on its own so there's no buttons

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.139 
diving on its own so there's no buttons
you<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> press<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> jump

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you have to press you just have to jump

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
you have to press you just have to jump
or<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.539> walk<00:00:54.719> off<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:56.309> sure<00:00:56.340> you're

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
or just walk off so make sure you're

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420 
or just walk off so make sure you're
landing<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.059> water<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> it'll<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:59.190> his<00:00:59.309> little

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
landing in water and it'll do his little

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.599 
landing in water and it'll do his little
thing<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.329> once<00:01:01.140> you've<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.980> you're

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
thing so once you've got that one you're

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.859 
thing so once you've got that one you're
gonna<00:01:02.850> head<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.059> back<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:05.659> speed<00:01:06.659> speed

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
gonna head right back up and speed speed

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.050 
gonna head right back up and speed speed
speed<00:01:06.900> speed<00:01:07.490> looks<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.670> he's<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.000> crack<00:01:11.060> get

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
speed speed looks like he's on crack get

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
speed speed looks like he's on crack get
up<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.659> went<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> right

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
up and we went to the one on the right

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.609 
up and we went to the one on the right
last<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.970> we're<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.390> left<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
last time so we're gonna go left this

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.020 
last time so we're gonna go left this
time<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> mini-map

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
time you can kind of see on the mini-map

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
time you can kind of see on the mini-map
there's<00:01:18.270> two<00:01:18.479> things<00:01:19.439> sticking<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.189> top

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
there's two things sticking out on top

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.810 
there's two things sticking out on top
you<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.570> both<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.020> those<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you do both of those so here is the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.380 
you do both of those so here is the
second<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.820> never<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
second one and I would never do that in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
second one and I would never do that in
real<00:01:27.540> life<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.960> pretty<00:01:28.200> high<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.030> hate

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
real life it's pretty high and I hate

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.370 
real life it's pretty high and I hate
Heights<00:01:30.890> anyway<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.299> find<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.720> boost

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
Heights anyway I find the boost

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
Heights anyway I find the boost
underwater<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:35.909> compared<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
underwater is really good compared to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.770 
underwater is really good compared to
the<00:01:36.600> boost<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.140> land<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:39.150> underwater<00:01:39.509> boost

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the boost on land the underwater boost

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
the boost on land the underwater boost
it<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.200> fast

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it was fast

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.300 
it was fast
so<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.330> gotta<00:01:42.510> get<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.870> one<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.409> time<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so we gotta get up one more time and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.560 
so we gotta get up one more time and
once<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> top<00:01:45.090> we're<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> go

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
once we get to the top we're going to go

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.350 
once we get to the top we're going to go
