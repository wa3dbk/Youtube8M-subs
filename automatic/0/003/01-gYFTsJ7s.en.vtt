00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.010
 one and a half hours before the match, sports hall is the unity 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.179
 filled with ajax supporters at heerenveen 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.389
 and of course also with the supporters from delft who have been taken along 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.260
 and also present Jal is the largest who is shocked because of an injury 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.759
 to give birth 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.579
 well the same age already 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.769
 at the last two japan where I do continue the tax is of course 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.890
 or you train often 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.390
 but yes not because it did not operate on well did not return we drove 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.300
 with trainer 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.320
 and then I go back on your knees well and that puts you on the thinking of the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 every twenty years I just want to be able to do everything I want 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.680
 And in addition, had the check fur coat and go train and work and beautiful one in 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.720
 the aftermath with you should not argue with what holds me up at the moment 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.970
 just too much 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.860
 i want for myself i could be year so put the best dutch song 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560
 it is therefore not well restored 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.520
 then we will see what further we will do 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.690
 and then became aware there state by now 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 oste 5 in favor of dos 46 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.120
 dos 46 plays super ioc 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.980
 the first half 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.190
 very sharp 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 and often plays the fast attack 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.930
 casper tree from distance 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 and then it says 13 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.150
 trying occasionally brought back 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.660
 argenta about 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.340
 mary sign around us first 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.310
 has the opportunity to help customers again 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.280
 and now it does hit him he scores one of his two hits in this match 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.830
 but for the rest it is dos 46 the clock strikes 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.790
 nice double and two in between mirjam de kleijn and andrÃ© kuipers 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 there are fewer trains 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.730
 and treated better difference 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.980
 but as they go 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.940
 but give something back 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.130
 and if you have a nice tree a little later 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.130
 either a childminder 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 eighteen to 7 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.039
 possession again for dos 46 shortly before half-time 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.299
 attempts of matter around 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.659
 16 7 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.659
 And that is of course a huge lead for the team from Nijeveen 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.569
 marieke henselmans yearn to do something in return 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.179
 and so peace is achieved at a position of 16 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.579
 benefit of dos 46 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 but in the second half in the sudden the other match 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 dos 46 is having a hard time 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.069
 then the three-year-old student set this standard 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.869
 hendrikse de stood 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.989
 18 13 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.909
 moments later at the table for fortuna 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.319
 thomas reijgersberg anyway meanwhile for haryanto 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 the ball comes through the nyse broom 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.590
 and then the difference is only four hits 18 14 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.199
 dos is trying to do boarnsterhim 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.099
 get it for the occasion 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.279
 prevent a walk-in closet 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.279
 peter lageweg 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.040
 fortuna then scores three times in a row and then suddenly he stops 19 17 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.559
 And then dealing is exciting surrender 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.789
 because the door is locked 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.429
 but as it goes 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.429
 dos 46 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.099
 not adele but a lot of blood and sweat in the toilet
