is our new web-based content creation
tool<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:09.210> while<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.540> could<00:00:09.870> create<00:00:10.650> an<00:00:10.769> example

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
tool so while I could create an example

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.770 
tool so while I could create an example
scene<00:00:11.370> I'm<00:00:11.730> going<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.179> start<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:12.509> an<00:00:12.660> empty

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
scene I'm going to start with an empty

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.770 
scene I'm going to start with an empty
scene<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:14.490> then<00:00:14.969> let's<00:00:15.210> start<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> box

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
scene and then let's start with a box

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.019 
scene and then let's start with a box
this<00:00:16.710> box<00:00:16.949> I've<00:00:17.160> already<00:00:17.400> turned<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> edge

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
this box I've already turned on the edge

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.060 
this box I've already turned on the edge
selection<00:00:18.359> mode<00:00:18.660> via<00:00:18.990> here<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.890> see

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
selection mode via here so you can see

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.370 
selection mode via here so you can see
its<00:00:20.189> edges<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.330> when<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.779> doing<00:00:21.900> polygon

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
its edges so when you're doing polygon

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.380 
its edges so when you're doing polygon
editing<00:00:23.189> usually<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.240> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
editing usually what you want to do is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.570 
editing usually what you want to do is
you<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.810> UM<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:26.070> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> use<00:00:26.400> these

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you want to UM you want to use these

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.640 
you want to UM you want to use these
buttons<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.840> face<00:00:28.080> sub

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
buttons here so this is your face sub

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.030 
buttons here so this is your face sub
object<00:00:29.039> editing<00:00:29.310> mode<00:00:29.460> edge<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.539> vertex<00:00:31.500> so

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
object editing mode edge and vertex so

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.170 
object editing mode edge and vertex so
let's<00:00:32.189> start<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> face<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
let's start with the face I'm going to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.670 
let's start with the face I'm going to
here<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> take<00:00:34.170> this

side here I'm actually going to take

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.480 
side here I'm actually going to take
these<00:01:47.050> I'm<00:01:47.380> going<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.590> move<00:01:47.770> these<00:01:48.009> outwards

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
these I'm going to move these outwards

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.490 
these I'm going to move these outwards
going<00:01:48.759> back<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.060> translation<00:01:49.600> I'm<00:01:50.290> going<00:01:50.440> to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
going back to translation I'm going to

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.650 
going back to translation I'm going to
do<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.710> on<00:01:50.890> both<00:01:50.920> sides<00:01:51.369> just<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.880> give<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.210> bit

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
do that on both sides just to give a bit

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:09.650 
do that on both sides just to give a bit
more<00:01:52.899> of<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.140> wing<00:01:53.350> like<00:01:53.590> shape<00:01:54.310> here

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640 

let<00:02:10.260> out<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.090> then<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.390> final<00:02:12.960> touch<00:02:13.230> here<00:02:13.500> I'm

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
let out and then a final touch here I'm

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.740 
let out and then a final touch here I'm
going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.010> move<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.430> vertices<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.600> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
going to move these vertices up just a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.150 
going to move these vertices up just a
bit<00:02:15.960> because<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.260> find<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> gives<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.980> bit<00:02:17.130> more

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
bit because I find it gives a bit more

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.460 
bit because I find it gives a bit more
of<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.490> predator<00:02:17.910> shape<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.810> once<00:02:19.020> I've<00:02:19.200> got<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
of a predator shape so once I've got the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.910 
of a predator shape so once I've got the
basic<00:02:19.800> outline<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:20.690> what<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.960> do<00:02:22.170> let

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
basic outline here on what I can do let

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.410 
basic outline here on what I can do let
me<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.220> touch<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.550> up<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.760> ever<00:02:24.300> so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
me just touch this up just ever so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.310 
me just touch this up just ever so
slightly<00:02:24.450> we're<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.110> move<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
slightly we're going to move that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.590 
slightly we're going to move that
inwards<00:02:25.760> what<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.420> actually

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
inwards what I can do is I can actually

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.380 
inwards what I can do is I can actually
add<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> mesh<00:02:28.230> smooth<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.680> top<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.120> back<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
add a mesh smooth on top so I go back to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.290 
add a mesh smooth on top so I go back to
some<00:02:30.540> object<00:02:31.380> selection<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.250> come<00:02:33.000> down<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
some object selection I come down to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
some object selection I come down to
mesh<00:02:33.480> smooth<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
mesh smooth and then I can up the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.100 
mesh smooth and then I can up the
iterations<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.460> few<00:02:35.610> times<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.600> once<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:36.960> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
iterations a few times and once see that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.610 
iterations a few times and once see that
I've<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> very<00:02:37.650> plain<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.730> shape<00:02:39.480> now<00:02:39.690> let

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
I've got a very plain like shape now let

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.040 
I've got a very plain like shape now let
me<00:02:40.710> frame<00:02:40.950> none<00:02:41.570> let<00:02:42.570> me<00:02:42.600> turn<00:02:42.660> off<00:02:42.810> edge

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
me frame none let me turn off edge

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.920 
me frame none let me turn off edge
selection<00:02:43.440> there<00:02:43.920> show<00:02:44.610> edges<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.270> let's<00:02:45.810> add

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
selection there show edges and let's add

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.110 
selection there show edges and let's add
a<00:02:45.960> material<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.830> case<00:02:47.070> let's<00:02:47.490> add<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
a material in this case let's add a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.540 
a material in this case let's add a
plastic<00:02:49.110> we'll<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.190> clearcoat

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
plastic we'll go with the clearcoat

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.800 
plastic we'll go with the clearcoat
plastic<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.120> had<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.630> selected

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
plastic so I had to have that selected

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.500 
plastic so I had to have that selected
clearcoat<00:02:55.440> plastic<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> will<00:02:56.910> increase<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
clearcoat plastic and will increase the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.540 
clearcoat plastic and will increase the
mesh<00:02:57.690> smooth<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.080> bit<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.440> there<00:02:59.130> we<00:02:59.250> go<00:02:59.370> that's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
mesh smooth a bit and there we go that's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.830 
mesh smooth a bit and there we go that's
a<00:02:59.700> final<00:03:00.030> object<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:01.500> created
