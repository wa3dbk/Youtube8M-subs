00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 welcome to legends and video games the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.040
 weekly show that decides to make a video 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.400
 about a scary game a month ago 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 halloween because I can to these 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.430
 heights was already more than obvious that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.949
 many of you wanted a video 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.760
 trying fight night fredys 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.800
 especially from the exit of the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.570
 second part though and although it's what 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.309
 many want I will not explain the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.989
 story of the game there are already many videos 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.909
 of that subject and could not contribute anything that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.440
 it has not been said anymore is the creators 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.000
 they conceived history in this way 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 so mysterious precisely for 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 viralize the game in web videos 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 etc. I come today to talk to you about something 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.830
 most important and what happens to us all 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.830
 and each of us I mean 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.240
 you have scared you have stuck a jump of 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 the chair or you have just been surprised 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 slightly today I'm going to talk a little 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 about fear and the so-called hackers of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.260
 the video games even if we go for 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260
 parts 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.860
 white knight fredys has become popular 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.530
 lot in recent months is a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.930
 survival horror in quotes but of 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.909
 the fat ones is rather a simulator of 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.800
 night guard the game has provoked 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.780
 that hundreds and thousands of youtubers 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.060
 graben playing the main attraction 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.800
 they are the jump scherz unexpected images 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.540
 combined with loud sound that 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.030
 literally makes us jump out of fright 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.470
 five night at fredys is the evolution of 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.880
 those videos and mini-games that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.070
 used to scare our 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 unsuspecting friends staring at a 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.729
 static image looking for differences 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.619
 where there are none or trying to complete 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.600
 a game that requires 100% of our 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.460
 attention for at the moment of maximum 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.670
 tension cause a very funny fright 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.050
 but what happens in our body that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.060
 is happening in our body when 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.769
 we are frightened or afraid 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.330
 As many of you will already know, fear is a 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.860
 natural defense mechanism of our 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.630
 body that is activated in situations of 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.209
 danger and that causes the following 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.920
 symptoms the pupils of our eyes are 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.840
 dilate what allows us to see better 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 what are we facing the breathing is 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.500
 accelerates to get more oxygen 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.840
 in the body we release sweat for 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.519
 lower the body temperature the pace 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.960
 heart rate accelerates to pump more 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.940
 blood to the whole body 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.550
 the urinary and digestive systems are 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.590
 they stop the hair bristles to look 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.000
 bigger is something like a trail 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.920
 genetic that conserves our body 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.750
 similar to balloon fish but at scale 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.880
 very small and totally useless to these 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.350
 heights and finally the part that does 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.390
 that fear is attractive for 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.400
 some of us release adrenaline to give 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.740
 energy to the body and dopamine what 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.870
 interesting is that each person releases 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.490
 different amounts of dopamine what 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.410
 supposes there are people who are 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.630
 it's fun to be scared while 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.850
 that there are those who hate him is for this reason 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.400
 I personally do not enjoy games 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.290
 of terror as dead space or trust a 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.080
 game where the main attraction is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.670
 to be afraid to feel tension or to be scared 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.410
 I have never been attractive 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.360
 while there are people as a brand 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.220
 beach range that enjoy this 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.300
 kind of games if you do not look at that face and 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.740
 tell him it's not the maximum 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.960
 representation of pleasure and 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.330
 satisfaction for us to follow the 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.460
 your though not all classes clear 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.170
 of fear release dopamine a scare 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.510
 controlled can be fun 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.400
 However, if we go a little further 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.100
 more in the fears we enter the field 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.150
 of the fear phobias that usually 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.549
 they are excessive and in many cases 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.530
 there are often external factors that 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.390
 unleash these fears as per 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.189
 example the common blonde the fear of 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.750
 clowns that is usually generated in the 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.390
 childhood with some crisis or scene 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.310
 traumatic instead others like the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.950
 hippopotamus monsters ski petal phobia 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.890
 or fear of long words what irony 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.750
 they are more irrational and are caused 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.370
 for society but for a change 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.230
 I'm going from the branches, let's go back to 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.720
 fight night alfred and let's talk about the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.909
 animatronics because it looks so 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.799
 disturber are designed is going to be a 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.599
 attraction for the little ones without 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.819
 However, make the hair stand on end 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.409
 painted as I said before fear is 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.720
 a natural response to danger 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.359
 but then because we feel fear 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.549
 when there is a real danger is to say 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.260
 playing fight night fredys los 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.150
 animatronics pose a danger to 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.070
 our character but we see it 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.660
 all in a controlled environment and in 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.639
 no case our integrity runs 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.139
 no danger not to say that 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.639
 anyone with two fingers of the front is 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.770
 able to discern situations of 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.570
 real danger the problem is that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.190
 between the real danger and the safety of 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.050
 our homes there is a sea of 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.760
 sensations and mysteries that nobody ends 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.070
 to fully understand 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.500
 have you ever seen an image that you 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.680
 it causes tension but a strange force 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.960
 tempts you to keep looking at you once 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.730
 you have felt uncomfortable watching a video in 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.860
 the one that did not appear anything extraordinary 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.390
 but the music combined with images 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.790
 properly chosen has made you 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.410
 shake you the ambiguity that they produce 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.030
 in our organism this kind of media 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.250
 roughly makes our 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.470
 brain is a mess a part 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.050
 responds with fear while others do not 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.330
 for that reason we feel uncomfortable or 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.890
 tensed a very recurring theme when 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.110
 talks about this ambiguity is the 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.580
 known a cannibal and but I'm going to 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.140
 save at the moment because your application 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.150
 to video games gives for a video 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.860
 whole and we are finishing the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.990
 animatronics of fight night alfred is 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.120
 they do a very good job getting 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.490
 this feeling the angles of the 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.410
 cameras about the dolls the 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.750
 sinister looks the heads that 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.940
 they seem cliche fairies combining all 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.980
 these aspects to the tension they produce 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.660
 can not move from the room 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.430
 developer team has achieved a 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.990
 simple but addictive horror game 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.880
 that puts the creeps to the most 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.320
 painted in no time we can 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.849
 compare it with other games of the genre 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.669
 survival horror as 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.749
 outlast or silent hill or with the fear that 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.879
 makes it happen to know that in any 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:57.099
 moment nemesis can appear by a 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.509
 resident evil door 3 but on the other 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.490
 side is not bad game to take a few 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.959
 laughs for friends and now that you're 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.459
 finishing the video I guess that normal 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.469
 would ask something like for example 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:06.939
 what is your favorite scary game 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.740
 although what I would like me to 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.319
 comment is actually what is it 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.929
 your favorite game to dry I know that 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.330
 it's hard to decide but I think that 

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:17.860
 I would stay with monster hunter 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.999
 I will prepare a video within no 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.679
 too 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.360
 for now that's all for today has 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:23.589

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.429
