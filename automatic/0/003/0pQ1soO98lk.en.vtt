little footage of the engine bay what's

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
little footage of the engine bay what's
under<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> hood<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.540> bit<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
under the hood and a little bit of the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:25.420 
under the hood and a little bit of the
trunk<00:00:17.600> all<00:00:18.600> right<00:00:22.160> it's<00:00:23.160> my<00:00:23.310> radar<00:00:23.609> detector

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
trunk all right it's my radar detector

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.029 
trunk all right it's my radar detector
have<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> hooked<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.210> fuse<00:00:27.859> for<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
have it hooked up to a fuse for the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:02:05.030 
have it hooked up to a fuse for the
radio

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.830 

so<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:07.680> filter<00:02:08.190> basically<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> open<00:02:09.720> air

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
so the filter basically the open air

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.140 
so the filter basically the open air
intake<00:02:10.350> cost<00:02:10.740> me<00:02:10.950> about<00:02:12.500> around<00:02:13.880> 50<00:02:14.880> bucks

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
intake cost me about around 50 bucks

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
intake cost me about around 50 bucks
from<00:02:15.630> autozone<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.300> fairly<00:02:18.480> cheap<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.740 

you<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.250> hear<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> turbo<00:02:23.790> way<00:02:24.090> more<00:02:24.360> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you get to hear the turbo way more I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.770 
you get to hear the turbo way more I
think<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.980> way<00:02:26.400> worth<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> want<00:02:27.600> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
think it's way worth it if you want to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.230 
think it's way worth it if you want to
hear<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.310> if<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.460> really<00:02:29.730> want<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.970> hear<00:02:30.210> your

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
hear it if you really want to hear your

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.970 
hear it if you really want to hear your
turbo<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.710> it's<00:02:31.860> completely<00:02:33.260> worth<00:02:34.260> it

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:03:39.949 

I'll<00:02:37.980> show<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> the<00:03:38.090> nice<00:03:39.090> placement<00:03:39.750> through

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I'll show you the nice placement through

00:03:39.959 --> 00:04:01.600 
I'll show you the nice placement through
right<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.870> my<00:03:42.989> audio<00:03:43.290> feed

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:11.050 

get<00:04:02.610> inside

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.189 

so<00:04:12.060> as<00:04:12.209> Otto<00:04:12.750> Otto<00:04:13.290> stick<00:04:14.750> with<00:04:15.750> man<00:04:16.079> manual

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
so as Otto Otto stick with man manual

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.390 
so as Otto Otto stick with man manual
plus<00:04:19.199> negative<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:20.310> go<00:04:20.430> up<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.740> push<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.280> up

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
plus negative to go up if I push it up

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:37.380 
plus negative to go up if I push it up
he<00:04:23.820> goes<00:04:24.030> up<00:04:24.210> one

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:05:16.260 

I<00:05:14.400> don't<00:05:15.400> know<00:05:15.490> if<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.670> could<00:05:15.850> notice<00:05:16.000> that

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
I don't know if you could notice that

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.050 
I don't know if you could notice that
but<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:17.680> pretty<00:05:17.890> noticeable<00:05:18.250> in<00:05:18.610> what<00:05:18.880> in

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
but it's pretty noticeable in what in

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.370 
but it's pretty noticeable in what in
real<00:05:19.270> life<00:05:21.510> hopefully<00:05:22.510> I'll<00:05:22.750> get<00:05:22.870> that<00:05:23.050> fixed

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
real life hopefully I'll get that fixed

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.630 
real life hopefully I'll get that fixed
soon<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:24.790> next<00:05:25.380> next<00:05:26.380> mod<00:05:26.650> I'd<00:05:27.010> probably<00:05:27.430> be

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
soon the next next mod I'd probably be

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.540 
soon the next next mod I'd probably be
doing<00:05:28.050> would<00:05:29.050> be<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.230> boost<00:05:29.590> gauge<00:05:29.860> I'm

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
doing would be a boost gauge I'm

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.500 
doing would be a boost gauge I'm
thinking<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:31.060> mounting<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.750> around<00:05:32.080> here<00:05:33.510> so

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
thinking of mounting it around here so

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.250 
thinking of mounting it around here so
I'll<00:05:35.110> try<00:05:35.350> to<00:05:35.410> get<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.980> video<00:05:36.910> of<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.240> soon
