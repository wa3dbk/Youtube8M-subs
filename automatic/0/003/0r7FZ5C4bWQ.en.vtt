00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.370
 this new video wants this video 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.750
 I adjust the shoes 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.750
 show it again in more detail 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.190
 first of all this video comes on the 24th 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.180
 as I said 16.30 so 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.890
 if you are watching the video right now 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.120
 then 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.379
 Merry Christmas 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 but we want to be completely normal 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.450
 so get started 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.210
 so so much has written to me that 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.800
 the attitudes somehow too 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.270
 drive complicated or 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.370
 They did not have a few settings 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.740
 fully understood and therefore it is 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.450
 too much configuration came around me 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.430
 I would like to watch it today 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.920
 First of all I'm ever in 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.720
 the attitude yes, you open the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.170
 app as I have already done 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.760
 you see this start recording 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.820
 button below just click next to it 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 this one and then you are in the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 settings for the corresponding 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.430
 recording option so here you can 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.130
 then choose the format 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.550
 Since you have two choices on 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 mp4 and once mv here we have the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.340
 irritation so the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.750
 Options like this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.000
 video is to be recorded 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.160
 there have many problems with because 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.280
 The iphone can only be one way 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.479
 record either upright or 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.060
 sideways like a normal video 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.090
 that's the case, that means if 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.920
 Receive your eps which must be on the side 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.259
 you also choose the setting sideways 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.119
 do you take a video on edge must 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.009
 the whole set upright 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.080
 otherwise the video is behind 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.970
 turned around the wrong way so pay attention 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.649
 this attitude is very important then 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.119
 we still have the settings of 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.119
 the solution 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:08.740
 that means the resolution you can in 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.399
 1080 720 and 640 480 3 160 and 240 ps 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.500
 take up 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.650
 Of course you can do it like us 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.260
 I would like you to ask for that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.569
 to explain completely if you have it 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.920
 sets high and a computationally intensive app 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.910
 is used by the high frame rate 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.170
 the video jerk and because the frame rate 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.209
 but also very important in this 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.410
 video so that it does not jerk her allowed 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.090
 not too low then have to 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 you just try it yourself 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.810
 runs most conclusively with you and then 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.190
 it was already with these 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.330
 more options can 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.340
 do not actually do it here 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.290
 So it's relatively simple, though 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.160
 I wanted to explain it anyway 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.660
 I have already several people 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120
 have written to me and I do it every time 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.849
 had to explain anew and yes then 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.530
 it was already with this video 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.600
 Merry Christmas 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.610
 and see you next week 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.780
 Wednesday at the 31 so logically too 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.930
 New Year's Eve at 16.30 until then skin 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.930
 purely
