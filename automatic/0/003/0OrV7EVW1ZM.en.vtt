yeah at the big occasion look at that
just<00:05:11.810> incredible<00:05:12.830> three<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.010> half<00:05:14.070> turns

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
just incredible three and a half turns

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.190 
just incredible three and a half turns
great<00:05:16.440> position<00:05:16.860> in<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.070> air

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.330 

beautiful<00:05:22.200> and<00:05:22.410> she<00:05:22.620> was<00:05:22.800> off<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.100> races

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
beautiful and she was off to the races

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.220 
beautiful and she was off to the races
then<00:05:23.730> thought<00:05:24.120> she<00:05:24.270> might<00:05:24.480> have<00:05:24.720> put<00:05:24.870> a<00:05:24.900> triple

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
then thought she might have put a triple

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.480 
then thought she might have put a triple
loop<00:05:25.350> on<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.560> end<00:05:25.620> of<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.130> be<00:05:26.250> honest

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
loop on the end of this to be honest

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.070 
loop on the end of this to be honest
with<00:05:26.580> you<00:05:26.840> she<00:05:27.840> could<00:05:28.020> have<00:05:28.110> done<00:05:31.640> but<00:05:32.640> that's

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
with you she could have done but that's

how far in the lead is she going to bed

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.030 
how far in the lead is she going to bed
I<00:06:26.310> think<00:06:27.180> it<00:06:27.300> could<00:06:27.450> be<00:06:27.570> put<00:06:27.810> away<00:06:28.110> in<00:06:28.920> the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
I think it could be put away in the

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.500 
I think it could be put away in the
second<00:06:29.430> mark<00:06:29.640> is<00:06:29.880> gonna<00:06:30.060> help<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.420> their

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
second mark is gonna help and their

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.930 
second mark is gonna help and their
first<00:06:30.720> Mouse<00:06:30.930> gotta<00:06:31.230> be<00:06:31.380> good<00:06:31.560> because<00:06:31.940> what's

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
first Mouse gotta be good because what's

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.340 
first Mouse gotta be good because what's
the<00:06:33.000> base<00:06:33.240> value<00:06:33.270> for<00:06:33.780> the<00:06:33.840> triple<00:06:34.080> axel<00:06:34.110> eight

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
the base value for the triple axel eight

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.600 
the base value for the triple axel eight
eight<00:06:34.620> and<00:06:34.800> a<00:06:34.830> half<00:06:34.860> points<00:06:35.340> I<00:06:35.400> think

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
eight and a half points I think

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.300 
eight and a half points I think
something<00:06:36.030> like

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
something like

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.260 
something like
yeah<00:06:37.300> 8.5<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:39.430> she's<00:06:39.580> likely<00:06:39.850> to<00:06:40.030> get

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
yeah 8.5 and she's likely to get

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.390 
yeah 8.5 and she's likely to get
positive<00:06:41.050> grade<00:06:41.560> of<00:06:41.680> execution<00:06:42.160> from<00:06:42.250> the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
positive grade of execution from the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.640 
positive grade of execution from the
judges<00:06:42.610> than<00:06:42.940> 8.5<00:06:43.540> could<00:06:43.960> go<00:06:44.080> up<00:06:44.260> that's<00:06:44.410> just

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
judges than 8.5 could go up that's just

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.640 
judges than 8.5 could go up that's just
on<00:06:44.770> one<00:06:44.950> ammon<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:46.090> casados<00:06:46.600> parents<00:06:47.020> no<00:06:47.410> blow
