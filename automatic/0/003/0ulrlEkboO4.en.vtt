00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello how about this time I bring you a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.540
 recommendations video the brushes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.850
 basic and baratitas that you should 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.480
 you should have or at least that 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.820
 I recommend that they are very economical that 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.050
 work well that can replace 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.030
 even with high cost brushes and vouchers 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 worth having in your kit either as 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.420
 user the makeup or how 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.920
 make-up artist the truth that you 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.140
 I recommend it a lot because I've 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 tried both on me and as the best 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 for a friend who has a friend and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.949
 good because I do not recommend it if 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.109
 They are inexpensive and you can get very 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.819
 easy so let's start if you 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.190
 interested in power to this one I show you all 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:47.590
 I would also like to say to me what is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.510
 low cost in terms of brushes for me 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.620
 let's say they start in the range of 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.500
 about twelve euros to ten eleven euros 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.399
 for me that would be economic brushes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.110
 or low cost then about that about 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.089
 that rank I'll show you how good 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.700
 showing with my brushes good the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.280
 first brush so economical can be 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.000
 get by ebay by amazon too and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.899
 also I have already dedicated a review 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.640
 quite complete I leave the link 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.220
 down with photography and even 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.509
 comparing it with other brushes and it's the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.110
 brand not in corner 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.300
 that I met her thanks to america or kick and 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.149
 Well I do not remember it cost me three euros 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.490
 the brush something like that is a let's say a 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.420
 tongue of little cats hair 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.870
 goat that is he has a hair 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 Super good 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.530
 Good quality wooden handle is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 they really are like to paint for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.620
 paint so they are not oriented 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.230
 specifically to makeup but they are 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.650
 artistic are art and they are very very 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.860
 all right 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.510
 this is opening the size because there 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.010
 two sizes from a quarter I want 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.480
 get the other the big one that I have 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.650
 hope that it is more or less like the 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.120
 the rest 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.120
 This is the little one and it's good 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.890
 very much for small areas in the eye 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.350
 to apply shadows especially for a 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.790
 little girl if you're a make-up artist and then 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.310
 you meet a little boy from the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.620
 even the flower pot that great 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.880
 I recommend this one has the ideal size 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.600
 even to blur 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.160
 pencil eyeliner down and good 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.710
 totally recommended and is a 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.250
 very good and economic good option 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:37.060
 next it 's as if it were the uar 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.740
 corner because it is also artistic 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.620
 they realize that they are like what they look like 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.940
 the two is a mango and other 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.540
 also of the brand is mango 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.140

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 selection of a filament filament 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.160

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.130
 certain parts if you're looking for 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.870

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.810

 they are and if not in any stationery 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.900
 look for sure there will be some some mark 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.209
 of artistic paintbrushes that 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.209
 will have this kind of brushes because I 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.799
 we fix that there are infinities and singles 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.400
 showing is to continue acquiring some 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:01.360

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.950
 also van gogh I love me 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.790
 I love to delineate it changes me 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.400
 finite is and besides that the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.880
 filaments these here are let's say 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.880

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.380
 an eyeliner comes great brand 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.030
 mango also in the 194 are not going to ask 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.600
 Rocha for lips or brush for 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.430
 delineate no is not that these are from 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.169
 stationery then simply because 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.200
 take care of them for moderation if you 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.440
 they want to take a look and it 's for 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.690

 I use it for the lip and for corrections 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.230
 this is from you think 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.670
 is the number because it has no life number 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.470
 in how he saw her because he is like this is 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.180
 specific makeup and it's for long 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.620
 and it has practically the same 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.230
 finished than the previous one what is a 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.050
 little bit shorter the subject of the 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.850
 straight hair for the theme of the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.660
 lips and outline some areas 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:17.460

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.570
 29m someone else asked for more the only bad thing 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.670
