I've always found with crash games is

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.199 
I've always found with crash games is
how<00:01:58.349> challenging<00:01:59.099> they<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.429> I<00:01:59.670> like<00:02:00.060> to

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.330 
how challenging they are I like to
consider<00:02:00.390> myself<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.289> vaguely<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:02.069> at<00:02:02.190> video

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
consider myself as vaguely good at video

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
consider myself as vaguely good at video
games<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.450> best<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:04.020> still<00:02:04.289> good<00:02:04.500> enough

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
games not the best but still good enough

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.680 
games not the best but still good enough
so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.009> review<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.429> game<00:02:05.520> fairly<00:02:06.030> crash

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
so I can review a game fairly crash

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.359 
so I can review a game fairly crash
games<00:02:07.020> however<00:02:07.289> I've<00:02:07.679> always<00:02:07.950> managed<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
games however I've always managed to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
games however I've always managed to
kick<00:02:08.580> me<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.819> balls<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.569> don't<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.380> what

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
kick me in the balls I don't know what

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.320 
kick me in the balls I don't know what
it<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.800> about<00:02:10.920> them<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.640> find<00:02:12.180> them

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it is about them I just find them

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.449 
it is about them I just find them
difficult<00:02:12.599> for<00:02:12.990> some<00:02:13.170> reason<00:02:13.590> my<00:02:14.010> only<00:02:14.220> guess

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
difficult for some reason my only guess

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.460 
difficult for some reason my only guess
is<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.760> crash<00:02:15.090> doesn't<00:02:15.450> jump<00:02:15.690> nearly<00:02:15.959> as<00:02:16.170> far

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
is that crash doesn't jump nearly as far

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.010 
is that crash doesn't jump nearly as far

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.640 
tested there are so many places where is
possible<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.450> skip<00:05:55.630> entire<00:05:56.020> levels<00:05:56.470> it's

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
possible to skip entire levels it's

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.980 
possible to skip entire levels it's
ridiculous<00:05:57.250> also<00:05:57.940> the<00:05:58.060> game<00:05:58.270> never<00:05:58.570> really

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
ridiculous also the game never really

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.140 
ridiculous also the game never really
explores<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.650> concept<00:06:00.130> of<00:06:00.220> two<00:06:00.490> arch<00:06:00.700> rivals

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
explores the concept of two arch rivals

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.820 
explores the concept of two arch rivals
having<00:06:01.510> to<00:06:01.630> work<00:06:01.810> together<00:06:01.990> against<00:06:02.710> an

having to work together against an

having to work together against an
intergalactic<00:06:03.280> threat<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:04.090> chickens<00:06:05.070> dafuq

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
intergalactic threat of chickens dafuq

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.740 
intergalactic threat of chickens dafuq
they<00:06:06.460> just<00:06:06.700> accepted<00:06:07.240> that<00:06:07.390> they<00:06:07.510> have<00:06:07.630> to

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
they just accepted that they have to

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.750 
they just accepted that they have to
work<00:06:07.900> together<00:06:08.050> which<00:06:08.650> I<00:06:08.770> find<00:06:09.010> odd<00:06:09.280> seeing

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
work together which I find odd seeing

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.460 
work together which I find odd seeing
how<00:06:09.940> much<00:06:10.120> they<00:06:10.270> try<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.540> kill<00:06:10.840> each<00:06:10.900> other<00:06:11.320> in

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
how much they try to kill each other in

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.680 
how much they try to kill each other in
previous<00:06:11.920> games<00:06:12.280> and<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:13.000> think<00:06:13.300> some

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
previous games and I think some

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.390 
previous games and I think some
opportunities<00:06:14.410> for<00:06:14.650> some<00:06:14.830> clever<00:06:15.070> dialogue

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
opportunities for some clever dialogue

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.760 
opportunities for some clever dialogue
were<00:06:15.820> missed<00:06:16.030> out<00:06:16.180> because<00:06:16.330> of<00:06:16.600> this<00:06:16.720> so<00:06:17.320> there

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
were missed out because of this so there

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.220 
were missed out because of this so there
