about<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.710> animation<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.670> great<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
about this animation was just great the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.370 
about this animation was just great the
one<00:01:49.530> flaw<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.100> found<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.960> only<00:01:52.079> flaw<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
one flaw I found and the only flaw I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.960 
one flaw I found and the only flaw I
think<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.220> who<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.520> animation

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
think that really is who this animation

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.690 
think that really is who this animation
is<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.320> way<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.040> he<00:01:56.159> bounces<00:01:56.520> off<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
is the way he when he bounces off the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
is the way he when he bounces off the
ropes<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.390> legs<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.200> weird

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
ropes the legs are like in a weird

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.719 
ropes the legs are like in a weird
position<00:01:58.530> that's<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> only

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
position that's the that's the only

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.010 
position that's the that's the only
thing<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.969> got<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> say<00:02:00.390> bad<00:02:00.659> about<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
thing I got to say bad about this
