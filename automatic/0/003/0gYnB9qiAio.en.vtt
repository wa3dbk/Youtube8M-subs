00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
valid point wouldn't it corrected it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.830 
valid point wouldn't it corrected it's

this<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.099> was<00:02:34.250> actually<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.970> think<00:02:35.180> unique<00:02:35.599> I

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
this one was actually I think unique I

same setup occurred
I'd<00:02:40.370> say<00:02:40.550> that's<00:02:40.700> pretty<00:02:40.910> close<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.300> Nirvana

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660
