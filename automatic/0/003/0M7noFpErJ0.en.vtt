we never give ourselves a chance to win
the<00:04:15.379> game<00:04:15.530> for<00:04:15.560> me<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:16.039> think<00:04:16.280> yourself<00:04:16.699> we<00:04:16.789> we

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
the game for me I think yourself we we

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.949 
the game for me I think yourself we we
thought<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:18.139> most<00:04:18.320> damage<00:04:18.769> would<00:04:18.889> happen

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
thought the most damage would happen

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.500 
thought the most damage would happen
kicking<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:22.430> way<00:04:22.580> we<00:04:22.760> clicked<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.210> second

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
kicking the way we clicked in the second

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.330 
kicking the way we clicked in the second
half<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:23.870> we<00:04:23.990> felt<00:04:24.199> if<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.470> call<00:04:24.680> come<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:24.949> with

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
half so we felt if we call come in with

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.450 
half so we felt if we call come in with
Neil<00:04:25.940> Neil<00:04:26.320> all<00:04:27.320> right<00:04:27.530> might<00:04:27.830> take<00:04:28.039> one<00:04:28.250> nil

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
Neil Neil all right might take one nil

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.570 
Neil Neil all right might take one nil
obviously<00:04:29.389> 11<00:04:29.690> Pitman<00:04:30.039> we<00:04:31.039> felt<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.430> we

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
obviously 11 Pitman we felt that we

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.670 
obviously 11 Pitman we felt that we
would<00:04:31.910> give<00:04:32.060> us<00:04:32.180> off<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.389> great<00:04:32.690> chance<00:04:32.990> or<00:04:33.500> if

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
would give us off a great chance or if

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.620 
would give us off a great chance or if
we<00:04:33.860> add<00:04:33.949> those<00:04:34.160> conditions<00:04:34.580> in<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.180> first<00:04:35.419> off

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
we add those conditions in the first off

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.850 
we add those conditions in the first off
we<00:04:36.050> felt<00:04:36.320> we<00:04:36.440> could<00:04:36.650> we<00:04:36.919> could<00:04:37.070> score<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:39.710> as<00:04:39.800> I

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
we felt we could we could score but as I

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.760 
we felt we could we could score but as I
said<00:04:40.010> we<00:04:40.419> never<00:04:41.419> done<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.780> with<00:04:41.810> enough<00:04:42.110> he

today have done well enough for most of
the<00:05:59.020> season<00:05:59.170> so<00:05:59.950> I<00:05:59.980> have<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.340> look<00:06:00.460> at<00:06:00.610> that<00:06:00.730> as

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
the season so I have to look at that as

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.240 
the season so I have to look at that as
well<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.240> it's<00:06:01.360> easy<00:06:01.540> to<00:06:01.750> to<00:06:02.350> react<00:06:02.680> after<00:06:02.980> the

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
well and it's easy to to react after the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.010 
well and it's easy to to react after the
game<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:04.740> sort<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.830> be<00:06:06.580> over<00:06:07.270> critical<00:06:07.780> if<00:06:07.900> you

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
game and sort of be over critical if you

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.630 
game and sort of be over critical if you
like<00:06:08.230> I<00:06:08.530> think<00:06:08.800> you<00:06:08.860> have<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.070> bounce<00:06:09.220> it<00:06:09.490> out

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
like I think you have to bounce it out

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.220 
like I think you have to bounce it out
with<00:06:09.940> what<00:06:10.150> you've<00:06:10.360> seen<00:06:10.570> and<00:06:10.630> what<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:11.050> know

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
with what you've seen and what you know

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.770 
with what you've seen and what you know

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
and if I look at how we've performed

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.410 
and if I look at how we've performed
this<00:06:14.080> season<00:06:14.620> I'm<00:06:14.890> absolutely<00:06:15.310> delighted<00:06:15.700> if

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420
