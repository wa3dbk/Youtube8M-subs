hi<00:00:12.469> Kimo<00:00:13.469> directa<00:00:13.799> well<00:00:14.250> let's<00:00:14.519> get<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
hi Kimo directa well let's get the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.320 
hi Kimo directa well let's get the
director<00:00:15.540> mr.<00:00:15.900> kuna<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:17.730> show<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:17.970> he<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
director mr. kuna you show what he is

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.810 
director mr. kuna you show what he is
practiced<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.140> hard<00:00:19.170> let's<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> results

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
practiced so hard let's see the results

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.529 
practiced so hard let's see the results
of<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.240> practice<00:00:23.090> well<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
of all that practice well there is a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.890 
of all that practice well there is a
game<00:00:25.500> concept<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> free<00:00:26.640> they're<00:00:27.269> cutting<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
game concept of free they're cutting in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.430 
game concept of free they're cutting in
rising<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:30.210> able<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.949> cut<00:00:31.949> freely<00:00:33.440> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
rising and you're able to cut freely so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.369 
rising and you're able to cut freely so
here's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.210> technique<00:00:36.210> demo<00:00:39.170> in<00:00:40.170> this

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
here's a little technique demo in this

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.700 
here's a little technique demo in this
way<00:00:40.940> from<00:00:41.940> various<00:00:42.360> angles<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.140> various

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
way from various angles and from various

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.479 
way from various angles and from various
positions<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.059> freely<00:00:45.450> cut<00:00:45.840> objects<00:00:47.570> and

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
positions you can freely cut objects and

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.930 
positions you can freely cut objects and
the<00:00:50.489> visuals<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.000> generated<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.660> coordinated

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
the visuals are generated a coordinated

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
the visuals are generated a coordinated
then<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.090> regard<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.600> technology<00:00:55.550> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
then in regard to this technology this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
then in regard to this technology this
project<00:00:57.030> started<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> development<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
project started with the development of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
project started with the development of
this<00:00:58.620> technique<00:01:00.680> next<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.129> myself<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:03.090> do

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
this technique next you myself let's do

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.929 
this technique next you myself let's do
the<00:01:03.449> watermelon<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the watermelon and this is the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.940 
the watermelon and this is the
watermelon<00:01:06.450> earn<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.659> money<00:01:06.689> tree<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.530> don't

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
watermelon earn your money tree I don't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.230 
watermelon earn your money tree I don't
know<00:01:08.040> whether<00:01:08.189> I'll<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.460> able<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> cut<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.090> as

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
know whether I'll be able to cut it as

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.710 
know whether I'll be able to cut it as
well<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.080> went<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.619> III<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.310> let<00:01:11.549> me<00:01:11.580> try<00:01:14.720> Oh

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
well as it went in III but let me try Oh

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
well as it went in III but let me try Oh
some<00:01:16.650> people<00:01:18.770> shouted<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.890> amazement<00:01:20.189> that's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
some people shouted in amazement that's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.929 
some people shouted in amazement that's
great<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> cut<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.820> well<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
great just with a cut over well the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.130 
great just with a cut over well the
physics<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.780> even<00:01:24.900> better

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
physics are going to get even better

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
physics are going to get even better
with<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> watermelon<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.250> there's<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.939> real

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
with the watermelon and there's a real

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.730 
with the watermelon and there's a real
time<00:01:27.570> computation<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.920> taking<00:01:29.250> place

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
time computation that is taking place

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.530 
time computation that is taking place
next<00:01:32.119> we'll<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> mountain<00:01:33.750> park

you can see how dexterous he is with the
watermelon<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:38.000> we'll<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> cut<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.140> that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
watermelon now we'll do a cut of that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.190 
watermelon now we'll do a cut of that
rotating<00:02:40.120> watermelon<00:02:46.750> well<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.109> quite

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
rotating watermelon well this is quite

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.380 
rotating watermelon well this is quite
easy<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.829> isn't<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:50.170> next<00:02:51.850> let's<00:02:52.850> do<00:02:53.120> some

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
easy to do isn't it next let's do some

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.840 
easy to do isn't it next let's do some
juggling<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> learning<00:02:55.010> things

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.920 

difficult<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.540> cut<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.350> without<00:03:00.650> missing<00:03:01.100> it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
difficult to cut it without missing it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.220 
difficult to cut it without missing it
today<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:04.280> director<00:03:04.819> tamara<00:03:05.359> has<00:03:05.510> practiced

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.210 

this<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.280> really<00:03:16.310> difficult<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.680> please<00:03:19.010> give

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
this is really difficult so please give

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.460 
this is really difficult so please give
me<00:03:19.340> applause<00:03:19.670> if<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:20.030> if<00:03:20.510> I'm<00:03:20.750> able<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.350> it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
me applause if I if I'm able to do it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.490
