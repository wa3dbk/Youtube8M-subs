00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello how are you welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.880
 Total selection has ended the match 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.610
 of the Mexican national team against the USA 2 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.620
 0 defeat by Miguel Herrera on 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.809
 the team of jürgen klinsmann a match 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 bad for the Mexican team a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 first time that moderately plays 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 well the Mexican team however already 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 in the second half with the changes it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.060
 completely decomposes the box 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 miguel herrera here the topic leo is that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.890
 obviously it is still losing with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.050
 the US does not go and the team that plays 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.320
 those who play do not see a team 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.930
 solid Mexican with claw that tries to 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 battle this team from the USA that if 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 is well formed that is also 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.899
 well directed but that today also happened 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.579
 because of the fact that many players do not 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.250
 have the least idea what to do not the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.899
 game system affects many of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.000
 those who play for the first time 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.190
 which is the famous line of 5 I want no 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 Miguel Herrera is a game system 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.719
 obsolete is a game system that swims 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 almost nobody uses in the world if we saw it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.590
 in the world with the flying team 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.329
 but how good finally the players 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 they come from being in another position today 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.290
 mario is literally killed him 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.940
 for leaving it alone there in the middle of the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 court so that such Juan Carlos I 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.200
 I am happy to meet you if it ends up being 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.150
 It seems very complicated for me 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.410
 Mexican selection and good for this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.290
 combined Mexican that ends 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.090
 appearing today in san antonio to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.790
 many of them were big without a doubt 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.340
 the t-shirt of the tricolor including me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.470
 it seems that if in the system many are 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 accustomed more to 4-4-2 inclusive 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.960
 had to change miguel herrera in this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.330
 position in this alignment but more 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 beyond accommodation I think that the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.340
 conjectures I was going to have to take 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.890
 Miguel Herrera are clearly the only ones 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.010
 could be kept in selection is 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.670
 gerardo flowers there the subject of Luis 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.160
 montes herrera and I do not know if esquivel had 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.810
 enough to stay in 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.460
 one of the two teams from there in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 forward all those who remained as 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.560
 initials goodbye rhyming alvarado and the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.619
 link gonzález and prove it and baker man 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.970
 crown diskerud charts and morris the eleven 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.320
 holder of the selection of states 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.979
 united the one from mexico well we had already 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.209
 observed 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.459
 evidently that miguel herrera 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.530
 said saucedo mier rodríguez salcedo 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.370
 flores velarde is a ski slope 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.980
 towers 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.019
 big there's the summary of the first 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 time I read I honestly think that this 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.870
 party is more than to benefit Miguel 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.909
 herrera her technical body also 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.319
 generating more doubts about what happens with 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.390
 follow them to you in the second goal already 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.099
 we'll see later later 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.980
 an archer can not do it with so much 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.079
 experience and that aspires to be something in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.610
 an international competition such as 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.190
 america cup or gold cup and lalo 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.780
 Herrera is a victim of the game system 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.879
 Miguel Herrera does not help anything 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.379
 party to the big nor to the cube and 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.200
 that's why the team is so short 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.150
 Mexican I would understand that there is no 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.190
 modification in the first time by 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.640
 louse part by the need for 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.410
 want to keep your players in a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.290
 football idea that he has with that 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.970
 line of 5 because it leaves only the monash 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.609
 one in the midfield you end up winning 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.310
 that space to the Mexican national team and it's 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.230
 where bradley controls that has been 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.819
 turned without doubt in the man more 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.760
 important in the selection of 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.519
 united states not only in this years 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.160
 and in all the last 34 years I think 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.730
 that has been the best became 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.489
 a truth 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.409
 headache and that's why it was the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.239
 number of arrivals he had in the 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:36.069
 first time the selection of the usa 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:39.670
 I do not know if you already miguel herrera stubborn sins 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.650
 for sometimes maintaining that system of 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.690
 game but it's also a clear idea that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.250
 he wants to show that he ends 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.260
 working so far in the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.269
 America that ends up working in 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.769
 selection and will not stop using it 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.780
 even going to need that 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.690
 players enter that rhythm of game 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.970
 that's why he says I'm going to call those who 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.950
 serve me not to those who can best 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.650
 be perhaps in the Latin them 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.480
 It also serves thanks to the help of the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.670
 divine providence that winning title 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.970
 with america but help him played well at 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.739
 football in that campaign but expensive and almost 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.900
 you definitely kill certain 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.239
 footballers who are not used to 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.820
 in the goal caste that is eaten Cyril 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.820
 willow the shot of agudelo and there 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.729
 I was putting it that way 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.289
 the team from the USA on 2 by 0 george 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.030
 corral came the second half inside 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.220
 corral within the Catalan 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.770
 it was mountain it is written they changed it of 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.860
 broadband which is the same as towers 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.920
 Herrera without modifying the Mexican team 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.930
 the tactical stop finish a 4-4-2 at 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.320
 end of accounts we already saw it with this 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.660
 situation of the monash one and the chaca 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.550
 that little could be shown I think that 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.550
 here he ends up staying 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.220
 unfortunately the theme for the chaca 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.379
 which is one of the players that most 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.750
 could show in the Mexican national team 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.009
 today with all the variants with all 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.620
 the situations that were seen in the 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.500
 field nor did I allow this this player 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.840
 show the level that I could have today 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.060
 really little too little and it was left 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.069
 great to many players the beach was 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.840
 the Mexican team saw a lot of them 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.639
 it ends up evidently weighing some 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.050
 who debuted for example I say the chaca 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.060
 usually because it is a side 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.590
 right with a lot of output today ends 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.629
 playing as a flyer on the right is 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.039
 also say miguel performs certain 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.599
 experiments with footballers who 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.370
 obviously they are not used to 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.590
 that position at level it finishes 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.289
 changing of band that is to say if miguel 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.539
 Herrera has to do it is not normal 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.430
 the problem is the how and the forms and 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.680
 against whom you do it is not broken 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.370
 I decide against panama against honduras 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.009
 against costa rica against whom you 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.530
 say so much change seems valid 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.569
 here finally comes here the mockery 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.729
 do not depredate again with us I do not know 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.580
 how much today with the selection 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.420
 Mexican and is already saying Miguel 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.280
 herrera 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.040
 in advance what I was going to do 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.600
 this party that the issue of caring for 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.640
 a lot of the players so it's going to 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.290
 be the Friday game because it does not 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.170
 ends up addressing that seriousness that 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.600
 needs and I do not know if today we talk about 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.880
 yield a lot on the part of the selection 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.710
 mexicana by the direction of selections 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.870
 nationals was a game that was held 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.960
 to be yes or yes you had to 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.910
 show that it had to be done but 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.610
 yes it depends a lot on how much is yielding 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.890
 and the Mexican team in terms of 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.480
 the games and as for the players 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.090
 what should be taken care of by miguel herrera 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.310
 I think it's a piece of paper that is not 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.350
 budgeted to go evidently to 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.060
 the American Cup not because it happened 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.300
 also four years ago with that 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.670
 Mexican national team and I think I would have 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.280
 that obviously to take care of that Miguel 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.990
 Herrera does not carry such a selection 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.820
 low level to the america cup taking in 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.800
 account that has few footballers and 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.030
 On the other hand I keep insisting that 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.060
 I think the gold cup can win 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.610
 Miguel Herrera Clara will come the duel 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.580
 against the selection of the USA and there it is 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.919
 where again we will see what happens not 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.500
 yes and if they arrive because we are talking 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.930
 of the first of three possible matches 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.789
 now the situation is to see the logic says 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.310
 that will be in the final both the 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.169
 united states like mexico but if it is 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.139
 very difficult to come to augury this 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:22.080
 situation are six matches from the 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.750
 us who have the hegemony or who do not 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.000
 can beat you in this possibility and 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.919
 that achievement because they have already finished 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.949
 being something very complicated for the 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.479
 Mexican selection of power to endure 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.490
 we listen to the report of the people who 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.979
 was in the broadcast of this match 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.379
 and took much the theme that Vincent 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.360
 Matías Vuoso is shaping up to be one of 

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:44.400
 the reinforcements of the america cup or one 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.960
 of the players that is in the cup 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.879
 America could not travel to this game
