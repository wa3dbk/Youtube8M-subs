continue on with talking a little bit
about<00:00:06.629> initiating<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.290> break<00:00:07.470> out<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.919> show

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
about initiating a break out and show

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820 
about initiating a break out and show
you<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.910> really<00:00:09.120> simple<00:00:09.630> breakout<00:00:10.260> progression

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
you a really simple breakout progression

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
you a really simple breakout progression
drill<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.340> can<00:00:11.490> use<00:00:11.639> with<00:00:11.790> your<00:00:11.940> team<00:00:12.150> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
drill that you can use with your team to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.600 
drill that you can use with your team to
begin<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.559> implement<00:00:13.830> some<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.429> patterns

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
begin to implement some of the patterns

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.720 
begin to implement some of the patterns
that<00:00:15.289> recur<00:00:16.289> every<00:00:16.980> time<00:00:17.160> your<00:00:17.279> team<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
that recur every time your team is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.140 
that recur every time your team is
executing<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> breakout<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.109> game<00:00:19.970> one<00:00:20.970> thing

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
executing a breakout in a game one thing

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.090 
executing a breakout in a game one thing
that<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> usually<00:00:22.080> mentioned<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.680> always

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
that I usually mentioned is I always

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.859 
that I usually mentioned is I always
really<00:00:23.369> liked<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.730> work<00:00:23.850> skills<00:00:24.539> in

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
really liked to work skills in

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
really liked to work skills in
progressions<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.369> bit<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.760> start

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
progressions so it's bit you know start

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.410 
progressions so it's bit you know start
simple<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> kids<00:00:29.130> get<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
simple and then as the kids get the you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
simple and then as the kids get the you
know<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> initial<00:00:30.840> phase<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.529> whatever<00:00:31.920> skill

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
know the initial phase of whatever skill

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.700 
know the initial phase of whatever skill
you're<00:00:32.279> working<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.600> add<00:00:33.870> more

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you're working on then you can add more

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
you're working on then you can add more
and<00:00:34.829> more<00:00:34.980> complex<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and more complex things to the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.530 
and more complex things to the
progression<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.399> at<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.940> end<00:00:38.969> then

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
progression and you know at the end then

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
progression and you know at the end then
you've<00:00:39.690> worked<00:00:40.320> every<00:00:40.739> step<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you've worked every step of the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.010 
you've worked every step of the
progression<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:41.790> simple<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> most<00:00:42.570> complex

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
progression from simple to most complex

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.770 
progression from simple to most complex
and<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.610> every<00:00:44.969> different<00:00:45.270> variation

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and you know every different variation

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
and you know every different variation
along<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.950> what<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> do

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
along the way so what we're going to do

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
along the way so what we're going to do
let's<00:00:47.969> bring<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> rink<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:49.680> going

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
let's bring up the rink and we're going

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
let's bring up the rink and we're going
to<00:00:49.890> start<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.789> basic<00:00:51.360> basic

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to start this is a very basic basic

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
to start this is a very basic basic
breakout<00:00:52.410> progression<00:00:52.890> drill<00:00:53.120> but<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
breakout progression drill but like I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
breakout progression drill but like I
said<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.110> into<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.469> complex

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
said as you get into the more complex

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.619 
said as you get into the more complex
variations<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.610> add<00:00:56.879> different<00:00:57.180> tweaks

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
variations you can add different tweaks

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.560 
variations you can add different tweaks
and<00:00:57.870> different<00:00:58.140> elements<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
and different elements that will make it

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
and different elements that will make it
into<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.840> effective<00:01:01.050> game<00:01:01.350> situation<00:01:01.920> so

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
into a very effective game situation so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.950 
into a very effective game situation so
what<00:01:02.579> we're<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.390> we're

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
what we're going to do here is we're

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.929 
what we're going to do here is we're
going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> start<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> line<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.939> forwards

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
going to start with a line of forwards

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.330 
going to start with a line of forwards
on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.840> blue<00:01:06.960> line<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.979> put<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.250> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
on the blue line so put all your

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.390 
on the blue line so put all your
forwards<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> blue<00:01:09.030> line<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.250> what

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
forwards on the blue line and then what

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.090 
forwards on the blue line and then what
you'll<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> defenseman<00:01:13.680> start

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you'll do is have a defenseman start

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.789 
you'll do is have a defenseman start
about<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> dot<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.680> just

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
about at the dot and then you can just

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.260 
about at the dot and then you can just
have<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.070> other<00:01:17.220> defenseman<00:01:17.790> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.119> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
have your other defenseman kind of just

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
have your other defenseman kind of just
line<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.189> out<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
line up on the side out of the way of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.170 
line up on the side out of the way of
the<00:01:20.759> drill<00:01:21.020> we'll<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.820> group<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> pups

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the drill we'll have a group of pups

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.740 
the drill we'll have a group of pups
here<00:01:24.560> right<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> forward<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.630> what<00:01:27.630> we'll

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
here right with a forward and what we'll

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
here right with a forward and what we'll
do<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.860> start<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.250> drill<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> first

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
do is to start the drill the first

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.580 
do is to start the drill the first
forward<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:32.970> line<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.509> basically<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.170> make

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
forward on line will basically just make

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
forward on line will basically just make
a<00:01:34.619> pass<00:01:34.890> stick<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> stick<00:01:35.909> pass<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.079> stick

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a pass stick the stick pass on the stick

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.120 
a pass stick the stick pass on the stick
of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> defenseman<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:39.799> after<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:40.920> makes

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
of the defenseman and after he makes

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.350 
of the defenseman and after he makes
that<00:01:41.310> pass<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.909> he's<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.390> down<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
that pass then he's going to go down and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
that pass then he's going to go down and
just<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.540> my<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.810> arrow<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.860> down<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
just get my right arrow here go down and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
just get my right arrow here go down and

I off the puck you know as they get
older<00:02:14.820> there<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.450> certain<00:02:15.840> times<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.260> places

sense<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> regular<00:02:21.210> power<00:02:21.690> turn

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
sense to just do a regular power turn

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.900 
sense to just do a regular power turn
instead<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.290> an<00:02:22.410> inside<00:02:22.710> reverse<00:02:22.830> pivot<00:02:23.220> but

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
instead of an inside reverse pivot but

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
instead of an inside reverse pivot but
for<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.300> sake<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.720> drill<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.380> sake

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
for the sake of this drill for the sake

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.340 
for the sake of this drill for the sake
of<00:02:26.000> learning<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.270> general<00:02:27.300> what<00:02:28.140> we're<00:02:28.260> going

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
of learning in general what we're going

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.540 
of learning in general what we're going
to<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> kids<00:02:29.100> doing<00:02:29.340> inside

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
to do is have the kids doing inside

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.030 
to do is have the kids doing inside
reverse<00:02:29.850> pivot<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.410> means<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.800> they'll

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
reverse pivot so that means that they'll

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.640 
reverse pivot so that means that they'll
go<00:02:32.220> down<00:02:32.750> never<00:02:33.750> taking<00:02:34.110> their<00:02:34.260> eye<00:02:34.290> off<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
go down never taking their eye off the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.930 
go down never taking their eye off the
puck<00:02:34.860> slow<00:02:35.040> tune<00:02:35.220> inside<00:02:35.490> reverse<00:02:35.760> pivot

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
puck slow tune inside reverse pivot

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300 
puck slow tune inside reverse pivot
around<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.300> bottom<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.720> circle<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:38.100> then

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
around the bottom of the circle and then

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
around the bottom of the circle and then
another<00:02:38.760> inside<00:02:39.210> reverse<00:02:39.240> pivot<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.990> they<00:02:40.320> get

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
another inside reverse pivot as they get

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220 
another inside reverse pivot as they get
kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.250> towards<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> hash<00:02:41.880> marks<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.480> so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
kind of towards the hash marks and so

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.720 
kind of towards the hash marks and so
this<00:02:43.410> ends<00:02:43.710> up<00:02:43.920> looking<00:02:44.100> somewhat

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
this ends up looking somewhat

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.340 
this ends up looking somewhat
complicated<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> arrows<00:02:45.840> but

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
complicated with the arrows but

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.670 
complicated with the arrows but
basically<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:48.240> make<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.570> simple<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.050> tell

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
basically to make it simple just tell

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.470 
basically to make it simple just tell
the<00:02:49.770> kids<00:02:49.980> not<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:50.610> their<00:02:50.820> eyes<00:02:50.970> off<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the kids not to take their eyes off the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480 
the kids not to take their eyes off the
puck<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:52.980> they're<00:02:53.100> going<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> do

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
puck so that's what they're going to do

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.190 
puck so that's what they're going to do
they're<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.850> do<00:02:54.030> inside<00:02:54.660> reverse<00:02:54.990> pivot

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
they're going to do inside reverse pivot

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.860 
they're going to do inside reverse pivot
as<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.130> happening<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:57.180> defenseman<00:02:57.630> will

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
as this is happening the defenseman will

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.330 
as this is happening the defenseman will
take<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.350> turn<00:02:59.270> towards<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.420> boards<00:03:00.720> okay

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
take and turn towards the boards okay

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.320 
take and turn towards the boards okay
actually<00:03:02.340> I've<00:03:02.400> got<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.640> wrong<00:03:02.790> arrow<00:03:03.030> here

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
actually I've got the wrong arrow here

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.130 
actually I've got the wrong arrow here
let<00:03:03.630> me<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.580> delete<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.050> our

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
let me just delete that now that our

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.200 
let me just delete that now that our
defensemen<00:03:07.470> has<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.860> puck<00:03:08.040> make<00:03:08.850> sure<00:03:08.880> that

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
defensemen has the puck make sure that

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.150 
defensemen has the puck make sure that
we<00:03:09.300> reflect<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> arrows<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.010> he'll

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
we reflect that with the arrows so he'll

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.220 
we reflect that with the arrows so he'll
turn<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.640> he'll<00:03:12.240> take<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.450> puck<00:03:12.690> turn

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
turn and he'll take the puck turn

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.280 
turn and he'll take the puck turn
towards<00:03:13.680> abort<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.450> start<00:03:15.450> skating<00:03:15.690> behind

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
towards abort and start skating behind

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.050 
towards abort and start skating behind

out basically it just shows you some of
the<00:03:23.400> different<00:03:23.430> options<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
the different options that the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.770 
the different options that the
defenseman<00:03:24.600> can<00:03:24.780> use<00:03:25.400> as<00:03:26.400> he's<00:03:27.120> initiating

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
defenseman can use as he's initiating

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.300 
defenseman can use as he's initiating
the<00:03:27.990> breakout<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.160> particular

drill we're just going to have him skate

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
drill we're just going to have him skate
and<00:03:33.440> take<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> puck<00:03:34.740> into<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.040> quiet<00:03:35.220> zone

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
and take the puck into the quiet zone

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.390 
and take the puck into the quiet zone
which<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.080> area<00:03:37.380> just<00:03:37.830> behind<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.250> net

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
which is this area just behind the net

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.930 
which is this area just behind the net
and<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.980> know<00:03:41.070> from<00:03:41.280> there<00:03:41.490> he'll<00:03:41.700> just

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
and you know from there he'll just

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.080 
and you know from there he'll just
initiate<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> simple<00:03:43.020> board<00:03:43.620> side<00:03:43.860> breakout<00:03:44.310> so

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
initiate a simple board side breakout so

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.270 
initiate a simple board side breakout so
from<00:03:45.660> as<00:03:45.840> he<00:03:45.990> gets<00:03:46.170> towards<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:49.590> back<00:03:50.130> of

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
from as he gets towards the the back of

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.860 
from as he gets towards the the back of
the<00:03:50.340> net<00:03:50.520> then<00:03:51.030> he'll<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.330> take<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.750> make<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the net then he'll just take and make a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.940 
the net then he'll just take and make a
simple<00:03:52.080> pass<00:03:52.760> stick<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.880> stick<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.959> that

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
simple pass stick to stick on that

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.400 
simple pass stick to stick on that
forwards<00:03:56.430> stick<00:03:56.840> always<00:03:57.840> make<00:03:58.020> sure<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.230> you

forwards stick always make sure that you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.960 
forwards stick always make sure that you
tell<00:03:58.560> your<00:03:58.680> forests<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.280> their<00:03:59.430> target<00:03:59.790> out

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
tell your forests have their target out

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.180 
tell your forests have their target out
in<00:04:00.120> front<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.450> them<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:01.290> tendency<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.709> for<00:04:01.830> the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
in front of them the tendency is for the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.890 
in front of them the tendency is for the
young<00:04:02.340> kids<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:02.970> always<00:04:03.600> want<00:04:03.840> to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
young kids is they always want to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
receive the puck on their forehand so

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.980 
receive the puck on their forehand so
even<00:04:05.730> if<00:04:05.820> it's<00:04:05.940> going<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.330> there<00:04:06.480> you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
even if it's going to be on there you

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.960 
even if it's going to be on there you
know<00:04:07.110> even<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.470> even<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.670> means<00:04:08.820> that

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
know even if even if that means that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.090 
know even if even if that means that
they're<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.209> bring<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.230> behind<00:04:10.350> them<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.830> lot<00:04:11.070> of

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
they're we bring it behind them a lot of

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.230 
they're we bring it behind them a lot of
times<00:04:11.280> they're<00:04:11.430> reaching<00:04:11.610> behind<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:12.090> just

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
times they're reaching behind them just

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.280 
times they're reaching behind them just
so<00:04:12.300> they<00:04:12.360> can<00:04:12.450> pick<00:04:12.660> up<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.900> puck<00:04:13.050> on<00:04:13.170> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
so they can pick up the puck on the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.410 
so they can pick up the puck on the
forehand<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.220> make<00:04:14.580> sure<00:04:14.610> that<00:04:14.790> especially

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
forehand so make sure that especially

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.400 
forehand so make sure that especially
when<00:04:15.510> they're<00:04:15.600> on<00:04:15.660> their<00:04:15.810> backhand<00:04:15.990> that<00:04:16.290> they

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
when they're on their backhand that they

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.440 
when they're on their backhand that they
have<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.680> target<00:04:17.040> out<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.670> front<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.970> them<00:04:18.120> so

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
have that target out in front of them so

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.820 
have that target out in front of them so
they're<00:04:18.750> learning<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.170> receive<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> puck<00:04:19.709> out

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
they're learning to receive the puck out

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.440 
they're learning to receive the puck out
from<00:04:20.070> give<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> target<00:04:20.880> out<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.120> front<00:04:21.270> of<00:04:21.359> them

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
from give a target out in front of them

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.600 
from give a target out in front of them
and<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.560> will<00:04:22.650> help<00:04:22.770> them<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.040> future<00:04:23.250> years

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
and that will help them in future years

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.760 
and that will help them in future years
to<00:04:24.120> not

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
to not

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.529 
to not
setting<00:04:25.069> themselves<00:04:25.190> up<00:04:25.490> for<00:04:25.550> suicide<00:04:26.180> passes

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
setting themselves up for suicide passes

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.869 
setting themselves up for suicide passes
so<00:04:27.139> have<00:04:27.530> them<00:04:27.770> put<00:04:28.039> the<00:04:28.129> target<00:04:28.340> out<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.669> front

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
so have them put the target out in front

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.689 
so have them put the target out in front
and<00:04:29.660> then<00:04:29.870> from<00:04:30.110> this<00:04:30.259> point<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:31.370> forward

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
and then from this point the forward

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.779 
and then from this point the forward
will<00:04:31.819> pick<00:04:31.970> up<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.120> puck<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:33.580> skate<00:04:34.580> all<00:04:34.699> the

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
will pick up the puck and skate all the

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.779 
will pick up the puck and skate all the
way<00:04:34.879> down<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.150> ice<00:04:35.979> so<00:04:36.979> at<00:04:37.250> this<00:04:37.430> point<00:04:37.669> you

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
way down the ice so at this point you

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.249 
way down the ice so at this point you
know<00:04:37.909> you<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.180> set<00:04:38.389> it<00:04:38.479> up<00:04:38.539> so<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.960> you

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
know you can set it up so that it you

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.480 
know you can set it up so that it you
know<00:04:39.379> there's<00:04:39.560> another<00:04:39.740> set<00:04:40.009> of<00:04:40.099> defensemen

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
know there's another set of defensemen

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.800 
know there's another set of defensemen
down<00:04:40.699> at<00:04:40.819> the<00:04:40.879> other<00:04:40.970> end<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.389> come<00:04:41.569> up<00:04:41.690> and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
down at the other end to come up and

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.990 
down at the other end to come up and
play<00:04:41.900> one-on-one<00:04:42.199> or<00:04:42.680> if<00:04:43.490> you<00:04:43.610> want<00:04:43.789> to<00:04:43.819> just

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
play one-on-one or if you want to just

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.820 
play one-on-one or if you want to just
quickly<00:04:44.150> run<00:04:44.389> through<00:04:44.569> this<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.080> can<00:04:45.349> be<00:04:45.500> you

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
quickly run through this this can be you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.350 
quickly run through this this can be you
know<00:04:45.949> just<00:04:45.979> a<00:04:46.250> simple<00:04:46.550> pic<00:04:46.759> of<00:04:46.879> the<00:04:46.940> pot<00:04:47.120> can<00:04:47.270> go

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
know just a simple pic of the pot can go

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.869 
know just a simple pic of the pot can go
down<00:04:47.509> for<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.780> one-on-one<00:04:47.900> ah<00:04:48.530> no<00:04:48.849> type<00:04:49.849> of

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
down for a one-on-one ah no type of

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.180 
down for a one-on-one ah no type of
drill<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:50.659> that's<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.900> first<00:04:51.199> step<00:04:51.349> now<00:04:51.919> as

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
drill so that's the first step now as

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.550 
drill so that's the first step now as
your<00:04:52.490> players<00:04:53.060> get<00:04:53.300> more<00:04:53.479> complex<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.259> as<00:04:54.409> a

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
your players get more complex and as a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.499 
your players get more complex and as a
you<00:04:55.009> know<00:04:55.099> eventually<00:04:55.610> once<00:04:56.150> they<00:04:56.270> get<00:04:56.389> the

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
you know eventually once they get the

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.540 
you know eventually once they get the
hang<00:04:56.659> of<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.900> first<00:04:57.199> step<00:04:57.530> then<00:04:58.220> what<00:04:58.400> you'll

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
hang of the first step then what you'll

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.980 
hang of the first step then what you'll
want<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.759> do<00:04:58.909> and<00:04:59.120> I'm<00:04:59.389> actually<00:04:59.599> I'm<00:04:59.780> going<00:04:59.900> to

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
want to do and I'm actually I'm going to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.330 
want to do and I'm actually I'm going to
put<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.199> in<00:05:00.349> a<00:05:00.409> different<00:05:00.500> color<00:05:00.740> just<00:05:01.069> so<00:05:01.250> we

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
put this in a different color just so we

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.670

driving<00:06:48.949> wide<00:06:49.249> second<00:06:49.669> man<00:06:49.759> driving<00:06:49.999> to<00:06:50.120> the

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
driving wide second man driving to the

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.450 
driving wide second man driving to the
net<00:06:50.240> and<00:06:50.509> third<00:06:51.349> man<00:06:51.590> coming<00:06:52.099> in<00:06:52.219> as<00:06:52.340> the

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
net and third man coming in as the

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.610 
net and third man coming in as the
trailer<00:06:52.759> so<00:06:53.389> that's<00:06:53.569> the<00:06:53.779> simple<00:06:54.259> breakout

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
trailer so that's the simple breakout

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.830 
trailer so that's the simple breakout
progression<00:06:55.129> now<00:06:55.360> obviously<00:06:56.360> this<00:06:56.509> is<00:06:56.659> just

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
progression now obviously this is just

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.260 
progression now obviously this is just
the<00:06:56.990> basics<00:06:57.469> of<00:06:57.560> it<00:06:57.729> as<00:06:58.729> you<00:06:58.909> get<00:06:59.029> into<00:06:59.180> your

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
the basics of it as you get into your

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.050 
the basics of it as you get into your
own<00:06:59.539> team<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.169> what<00:07:00.289> their<00:07:00.919> needs<00:07:01.129> are<00:07:01.430> you'll

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
own team and what their needs are you'll

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.600 
own team and what their needs are you'll
be<00:07:02.210> able<00:07:02.270> to<00:07:02.419> you<00:07:03.110> know<00:07:03.199> tweak<00:07:03.469> it<00:07:03.710> fix<00:07:04.039> it<00:07:04.249> so

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
be able to you know tweak it fix it so

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.610 
be able to you know tweak it fix it so
that<00:07:04.639> it<00:07:05.509> can<00:07:05.810> be<00:07:05.900> applied<00:07:06.080> to<00:07:06.349> whatever

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
that it can be applied to whatever

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.170 
that it can be applied to whatever
breakouts<00:07:07.370> to<00:07:07.520> something<00:07:07.789> that<00:07:07.879> you<00:07:07.999> might<00:07:08.120> be

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
breakouts to something that you might be

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.269 
breakouts to something that you might be
using<00:07:08.419> and<00:07:08.719> also<00:07:09.560> you<00:07:09.620> know<00:07:09.800> make<00:07:10.039> sure<00:07:10.159> that

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:10.279 
using and also you know make sure that

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.769 
using and also you know make sure that
you<00:07:10.370> work<00:07:10.580> the<00:07:10.999> different<00:07:11.330> options<00:07:11.659> so

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:11.779 
you work the different options so

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:12.909 
you work the different options so
instead<00:07:11.990> of<00:07:12.050> having<00:07:12.139> the<00:07:12.349> defenseman<00:07:12.710> skate

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
instead of having the defenseman skate

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.709 
instead of having the defenseman skate
behind<00:07:13.189> the<00:07:13.249> net<00:07:13.400> every<00:07:13.550> time<00:07:13.729> set<00:07:14.360> it<00:07:14.449> up<00:07:14.539> so

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719 
behind the net every time set it up so

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:16.149 
behind the net every time set it up so
that<00:07:14.749> maybe<00:07:15.050> he<00:07:15.199> does<00:07:15.349> a<00:07:15.379> misdirection<00:07:15.889> and

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:16.159 
that maybe he does a misdirection and

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.700 
that maybe he does a misdirection and
break<00:07:16.639> it<00:07:16.789> out<00:07:16.849> the<00:07:16.969> strong<00:07:17.180> side<00:07:17.560> you<00:07:18.560> can

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
break it out the strong side you can

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.140 
break it out the strong side you can
also<00:07:18.860> have<00:07:19.159> it<00:07:19.189> set<00:07:19.490> up<00:07:19.520> where<00:07:19.789> there's<00:07:20.089> a

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
also have it set up where there's a

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.969 
also have it set up where there's a
second<00:07:20.900> defenseman<00:07:21.349> there<00:07:21.529> in<00:07:21.589> the<00:07:21.680> dee<00:07:21.830> doo

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
second defenseman there in the dee doo

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:23.850 
second defenseman there in the dee doo
dee<00:07:22.009> de<00:07:22.610> dee<00:07:22.639> pass<00:07:22.939> and<00:07:23.210> then<00:07:23.300> break<00:07:23.479> it<00:07:23.629> out

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
dee de dee pass and then break it out

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.019 
dee de dee pass and then break it out
there's<00:07:24.860> lots<00:07:25.069> of<00:07:25.279> different<00:07:25.339> variations

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:26.029 
there's lots of different variations

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.249 
there's lots of different variations
lots<00:07:26.210> of<00:07:26.270> different<00:07:26.509> weeks<00:07:26.689> you<00:07:26.900> can<00:07:27.020> do<00:07:27.139> with

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:27.259 
lots of different weeks you can do with

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.829 
lots of different weeks you can do with
this<00:07:27.379> but<00:07:28.129> it's<00:07:28.310> it's<00:07:28.819> a<00:07:28.879> very<00:07:29.240> very<00:07:29.300> effective
