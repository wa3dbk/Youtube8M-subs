how'd<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.830> tournament<00:02:33.250> feel<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.820> think<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:35.590> me

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
how'd the tournament feel I think for me

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.800 
how'd the tournament feel I think for me
it<00:02:35.950> felt<00:02:36.280> incredibly<00:02:37.030> different<00:02:37.450> than<00:02:37.600> when<00:02:37.780> I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it felt incredibly different than when I

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.390 
it felt incredibly different than when I
was<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.140> Pro<00:02:38.290> Tour<00:02:38.500> before<00:02:38.860> I've<00:02:39.100> been<00:02:39.280> off

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
was on the Pro Tour before I've been off

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.699 
was on the Pro Tour before I've been off
for<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.610> while<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.090> just<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.380> lot<00:02:41.560> more

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
for a while I just you know a lot more

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.900 
for a while I just you know a lot more
confident<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.130> think<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> edge<00:02:42.490> gave<00:02:42.790> me<00:02:42.880> a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
confident I think the edge gave me a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.970 
confident I think the edge gave me a
little<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.240> maturity<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.230> felt<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.800> lot

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
little more maturity and I felt a lot

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.920 
little more maturity and I felt a lot
more<00:02:45.209> comfortable<00:02:46.209> at<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.080> tournament<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
more comfortable at this tournament and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.630 
more comfortable at this tournament and
it<00:02:49.930> really<00:02:50.350> was<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> different<00:02:50.740> feel<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.489> his

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
it really was a different feel and his

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.810 
it really was a different feel and his
first<00:02:51.910> time<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.150> day<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.330> two<00:02:52.600> GP<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.980> mean<00:02:54.400> for<00:02:54.700> me

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
the Pro Tour and to me there was no

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.720 
the Pro Tour and to me there was no
decision<00:04:45.440> like<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.740> was<00:04:45.830> tough<00:04:46.100> because<00:04:46.370> like

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
decision like it was tough because like

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.310 
decision like it was tough because like
the<00:04:46.910> points<00:04:47.420> could<00:04:47.540> be<00:04:47.600> good<00:04:47.960> for<00:04:48.110> platinum

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
the points could be good for platinum

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.020 
the points could be good for platinum
but<00:04:48.530> if<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.710> just<00:04:48.890> lose<00:04:49.040> in<00:04:49.220> top<00:04:49.340> eight<00:04:49.520> which<00:04:49.910> I

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
but if I just lose in top eight which I

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.170 
but if I just lose in top eight which I
usually<00:04:50.480> do<00:04:51.040> it's<00:04:52.040> only<00:04:52.220> one<00:04:52.430> extra<00:04:52.670> point<00:04:52.940> and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
usually do it's only one extra point and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.690 
usually do it's only one extra point and
