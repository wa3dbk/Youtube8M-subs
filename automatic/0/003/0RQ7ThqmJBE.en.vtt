00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.980
 Hello my name is Camille I'm 16 years old 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.980
 I'm in auto mechanic undermining 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.830
 I arrived in auto mechanics because 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.970
 that my grandfather from a garage when 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.680
 I was younger I often went to see 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.830
 what was happening I wanted to try at 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.510
 final I stayed 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.550
 is being able to check the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.550
 see if they are in good condition or not 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.320
 in mechanics what we like 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.480
 it is rather than doing big jobs 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.550
 as gilbert mottard the joints of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.110
 cylinder head and looking for failure the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.960
 room train pass the suitcase kayes 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 for 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 diagnose the times that it speaks 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 alongside 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.430
 who 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.019
 what's good is that never 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.650
 same time with every day we 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.650
 learn something 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.030
 when she came here I 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.710
 reminiscent of a girl who returns 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.850
 in the workshop that tells me I'm looking for a 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.909
 supervisor and I answered him 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 anyway I'm not doing any 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.030
 secretariat 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.729
 eyes but black do not like anything 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.710
 mine his mechanics who can be seen 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.920
 the motivation she had play then the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.920
 challenge 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.360
 it is not necessary that he would make everything simple 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.640
 must rise higher it is bac 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.710
 pro I go first I promised heaven 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.080
 earning it ap I push 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.220
 until the end of the year 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.899
 I spend my sahara ps would like 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.410
 continue in baccalaureate pro and then a bts 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.470
 after 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.520
 and mister guy caby it's not too hard 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.170
 to be a man in mechanics 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.030
 listening is not easy every day 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.710
 but hey must go above 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.580
 clichÃ©s over prejudices then 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.580
 finally it goes well
