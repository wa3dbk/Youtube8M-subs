 window 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.590
 as you can see I have the unbox 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.690
 default and 2 more unboxing than degraded 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.000
 to create or sam vokes you have to give 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930
 really that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.430
 we are going to have these two created you 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.590
 that gives as many unbox as you want to 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.940
 through here create new unbox which 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.990
 says the name you want is not necessary 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.880
 let it be sanz or anything 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.509
 more unbox more accounts per spector 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.299
 and they are limited in case you have the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.590
 full version let's open the sham and 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.590
 let's connect the first account 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.090
 the same one that is the only one I have is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.090
 how do you recently 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.120
 we wait 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.240
 that we have realized 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.930
 let's put more accounts 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 let's right click on the sham 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.539
 execute elevation on both 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.459
 and default 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.140
 and we're going to see how another one opens up 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.329
 present saint come out 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.850

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.830
 we give him 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.580
 on this server so I'm connected the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.580
 user and the accounts promising me 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.270
 we can see that we get the order here and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.239
 this mouse is the reason why we have to 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.370
 minimize the gta and give it here to drag 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.140
 to the same folder to restore and move 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.130
 but we keep files 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.130
 this is a thing of 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.600
 of chat what has nothing to do 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.610
 with the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
 we have to give you something to do 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.290
 with the sham but it's no problem 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.880
 guys and ready we can see it we have 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.380
 the lÃ­bar account is the most 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.380
 we are going to create another 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.780
 let's drag the writing to the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.980
 friends 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.020

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.350
 click and let's wait for another account that 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.350
 it's called 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.620

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 and we will be able to 5 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 two 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.740
 we wait 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.760
 we already have the four accounts connected 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.570

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.580

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.310
 file of friend friend we can go 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.180
 moving from folder to folder 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.100
 I mean account in account, let's give it 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.350
 the first account 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.350
 this olive groves and let's go to the covers 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.150
 and we have the other user let's put 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.740
 that f 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.670
 so you can we can move 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.670
 against two accounts 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.160
 let's move that the two accounts 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.440
 let's also put what it says 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.800
 and here we have another account 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.800
 olive groves 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.400
 let's go to another the other turn 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.020
 let's put that example again 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.440
 since we have the two accounts of 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.289
 olive groves of maciÃ¡ and now this is the 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.629
 from channel 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.740
 and we are going to project ourselves with the other 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.860
 account 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.479
 come on , efe appears 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.000
 As you can see, there are the accounts 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.720
 affected 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.660
 and this kid that is not wanted and good 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.690
 Well, we can be driving with a 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.120
 account we can have them disconnected 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.340
 but it 's with the account just moving 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.220
 Clear 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.710
 and you may need two ropes that 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.910
 you want to affect from 2a you can connect 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.310
 up to 10 those that you want to keep in mind 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.340
 that each account consumes a cpu 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.129
 determined that is if you do not have a 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.229
 good 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:49.639

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:51.289
 more than 7 accounts and well that's all if 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.559
 have any questions you can contact 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.539

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:58.909
 or also through skype to skype what 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.589
