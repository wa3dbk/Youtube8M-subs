able to get to the micro SIM card slot

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.100 
able to get to the micro SIM card slot
until<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.459> open<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> cover<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.720> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
until you open up the cover because this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.890 
until you open up the cover because this
is<00:02:13.290> where<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.590> hem

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
is where the hem

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.710 
is where the hem
along<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.500> left-hand<00:02:14.829> side<00:02:15.189> but<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.569> only

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
along the left-hand side but the only

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.569 
along the left-hand side but the only
downside<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.500> can<00:02:17.650> see<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:18.310> far

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
downside that I can see to this so far

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.119 
downside that I can see to this so far
is<00:02:18.819> doesn't<00:02:19.390> add<00:02:19.629> much<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.680> terms<00:02:20.980> of

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
is doesn't add much in terms of

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.130 
is doesn't add much in terms of
protection<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.909> device<00:02:22.209> because<00:02:22.629> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
protection to the device because the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.619 
protection to the device because the
cover<00:02:23.409> is<00:02:23.620> not<00:02:24.010> magnetized<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.510> can

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
cover is not magnetized and as you can

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.240 
cover is not magnetized and as you can
see<00:02:25.750> as<00:02:25.900> I'm<00:02:26.079> opening<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.620> closing<00:02:26.980> it

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
see as I'm opening and closing it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
see as I'm opening and closing it
it<00:02:27.340> doesn't<00:02:27.790> dim<00:02:27.939> down<00:02:28.150> or<00:02:28.420> put<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.780> screen<00:02:29.110> to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
it doesn't dim down or put the screen to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.399 
it doesn't dim down or put the screen to
sleep<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.849> remember<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.290> that

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
sleep so you have to remember to do that

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.099 
sleep so you have to remember to do that
manually<00:02:33.069> but<00:02:34.000> apart<00:02:34.299> from<00:02:34.359> that<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.840> doesn't

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
manually but apart from that it doesn't

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.899 
manually but apart from that it doesn't
add<00:02:35.230> too<00:02:35.769> much<00:02:35.950> weight<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.640> device

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
add too much weight to the device

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.330 
add too much weight to the device
whatsoever<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.349> looks<00:02:38.560> pretty<00:02:38.769> classy<00:02:39.099> to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
be fair I'm liking the way it looks but

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.190 
be fair I'm liking the way it looks but
