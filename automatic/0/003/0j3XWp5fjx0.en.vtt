you some real-life examples that you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.400 
you some real-life examples that you
could<00:00:37.520> use<00:00:37.730> in<00:00:37.910> your<00:00:37.940> training<00:00:38.270> what<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.200> will

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
could use in your training what I will

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.080 
could use in your training what I will
not<00:00:39.560> talk<00:00:39.800> about<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:40.489> video<00:00:40.670> are

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
not talk about in this video are

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.120 
not talk about in this video are
physiological<00:00:41.989> things<00:00:42.230> like<00:00:42.500> exponential

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
physiological things like exponential

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.540 
physiological things like exponential

so<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.550> lot<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.820> times<00:00:52.180> different<00:00:52.810> coaches<00:00:53.290> or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
so a lot of times different coaches or

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.800 
so a lot of times different coaches or
different<00:00:54.010> training<00:00:54.430> programs<00:00:54.850> or<00:00:55.180> condors

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
different training programs or condors

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.210 
different training programs or condors
throw<00:00:56.080> out<00:00:56.230> all<00:00:56.440> these<00:00:56.560> different<00:00:56.980> terms

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
throw out all these different terms

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.660 
throw out all these different terms
they'll<00:00:57.550> be<00:00:57.700> tempo<00:00:58.570> runs<00:00:58.840> lactate<00:00:59.470> threshold

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
they'll be tempo runs lactate threshold

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.030 
they'll be tempo runs lactate threshold
threshold<00:01:00.670> training<00:01:02.040> anaerobic

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
threshold training anaerobic

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.940 
threshold training anaerobic
conditioning<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.780> lot<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.410> times<00:01:05.710> people

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
conditioning and a lot of times people

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.800 
conditioning and a lot of times people
get<00:01:06.160> kind<00:01:06.400> of<00:01:06.430> confused<00:01:06.820> from<00:01:06.940> that<00:01:07.120> but

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
get kind of confused from that but

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.660 
get kind of confused from that but
essentially<00:01:08.470> those<00:01:08.770> terms<00:01:09.040> all<00:01:09.310> kind<00:01:09.580> of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
essentially those terms all kind of

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.969 
essentially those terms all kind of
refer<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.270> same<00:01:10.570> pace<00:01:11.260> range<00:01:11.590> it's<00:01:11.800> kind

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
refer to the same pace range it's kind

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.100 
refer to the same pace range it's kind
of<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.160> same<00:01:12.430> training<00:01:12.790> stimulus<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.840> in<00:01:14.020> this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
of the same training stimulus so in this

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.020 
of the same training stimulus so in this
video<00:01:14.290> I'm<00:01:14.770> going<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.950> say<00:01:15.130> tempo<00:01:15.550> run<00:01:15.760> or

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
video I'm going to say tempo run or

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.270 
video I'm going to say tempo run or
lactate<00:01:16.600> threshold<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.350> it's<00:01:17.860> essentially

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
lactate threshold and it's essentially

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.850 
lactate threshold and it's essentially
gonna<00:01:18.430> mean<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.820> same<00:01:19.119> thing<00:01:19.510> so<00:01:19.900> forgive<00:01:20.650> me

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
gonna mean the same thing so forgive me

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.620 
gonna mean the same thing so forgive me
if<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.100> use<00:01:21.280> them<00:01:21.550> interchangeably<00:01:21.940> to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
if I use them interchangeably to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.080 
if I use them interchangeably to
quantitatively<00:01:23.530> define<00:01:24.160> this<00:01:24.460> pace<00:01:24.729> range

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
quantitatively define this pace range

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.290 
quantitatively define this pace range
you're<00:01:25.810> working<00:01:26.170> at<00:01:26.290> basically<00:01:26.710> 80<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.820> 90

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
you're working at basically 80 to 90

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.040 
you're working at basically 80 to 90
percent<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:29.020> your<00:01:29.860> vo2<00:01:30.070> max<00:01:30.550> or<00:01:30.850> about<00:01:31.060> 85<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
percent of your vo2 max or about 85 to

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.719 
percent of your vo2 max or about 85 to
90<00:01:32.320> percent<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.710> your<00:01:32.770> maximum<00:01:32.950> heart<00:01:33.610> rate

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
90 percent of your maximum heart rate

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.540 
90 percent of your maximum heart rate
now<00:01:34.479> if<00:01:34.810> you're<00:01:34.990> like<00:01:35.140> me<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:36.250> don't<00:01:36.430> really

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
now if you're like me you don't really

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.830 
now if you're like me you don't really
have<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.759> chance<00:01:36.910> to<00:01:37.119> go<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.330> lab<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.780> get

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
have a chance to go to the lab and get

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.690 
have a chance to go to the lab and get
these<00:01:37.990> tested<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.009> have<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.220> go<00:01:39.310> more<00:01:39.550> by

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
these tested so you have to go more by

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.499 
these tested so you have to go more by
feel<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.330> by<00:01:40.750> recent<00:01:41.170> race<00:01:41.410> performances<00:01:42.509> if

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
feel and by recent race performances if

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.350 
feel and by recent race performances if
you<00:01:43.660> look<00:01:43.840> at<00:01:44.050> if<00:01:44.710> you've<00:01:44.920> ever<00:01:45.070> run<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.360> 15k

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
you look at if you've ever run a 15k

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.810 
you look at if you've ever run a 15k
race<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> pace<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.250> really<00:01:48.490> close

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
race that is a pace that is really close

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.760 
race that is a pace that is really close
to<00:01:48.850> your<00:01:49.210> lactate<00:01:49.600> threshold<00:01:49.630> if<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> haven't

to your lactate threshold if you haven't

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.680 
to your lactate threshold if you haven't
run<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.890> 15k<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.520> could<00:01:51.790> look<00:01:52.119> at<00:01:52.210> your<00:01:52.330> 10k

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
run a 15k you could look at your 10k

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.859 
run a 15k you could look at your 10k
Road<00:01:52.899> pace<00:01:53.200> or<00:01:53.530> track<00:01:53.890> pace<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.399> add<00:01:55.119> about<00:01:55.450> 10

to<00:01:56.050> 15<00:01:56.470> seconds<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.069> mile<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.580> it's<00:01:57.700> kind<00:01:57.910> of<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
to 15 seconds a mile so it's kind of a

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.990 
to 15 seconds a mile so it's kind of a
pace<00:01:58.660> range<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.229> between<00:01:59.350> your<00:02:00.310> half<00:02:00.490> marathon

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
pace range in between your half marathon

pace range in between your half marathon
race<00:02:01.179> pace<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.750> your<00:02:02.200> 10k<00:02:02.440> race<00:02:02.770> pace<00:02:03.009> and

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
race pace and your 10k race pace and

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.389 
race pace and your 10k race pace and
that's<00:02:04.959> going<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.200> vary<00:02:05.500> depending<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:06.190> little

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
that's going to vary depending a little

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.609 
that's going to vary depending a little
bit<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.850> weather<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.420> how<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.110> feel<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.590> a

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
bit on the weather and how you feel on a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.919 
bit on the weather and how you feel on a
particular<00:02:09.160> day<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.240> it's<00:02:10.509> kind<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.810> an

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
particular day so it's it's kind of an

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.559 
particular day so it's it's kind of an
art<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.770> science<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:12.730> zero<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.270> on<00:02:13.480> that

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
art and a science to zero in on that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.780 
art and a science to zero in on that
specific<00:02:14.050> pace<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> give<00:02:15.700> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
specific pace that's going to give you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.699 
specific pace that's going to give you
the<00:02:15.880> best<00:02:16.090> stimulus<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.780> training<00:02:17.560> your

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
the best stimulus of training your

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.470 
the best stimulus of training your
lactate<00:02:18.100> threshold<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.819> lot<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.120> runners

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
lactate threshold so a lot of runners

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.500 
lactate threshold so a lot of runners
myself<00:02:20.260> included<00:02:20.890> run<00:02:21.310> these<00:02:21.490> tempo<00:02:21.880> runs<00:02:22.120> at

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
myself included run these tempo runs at

myself included run these tempo runs at
a<00:02:22.569> too<00:02:23.349> high<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.770> intensity<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.490> run<00:02:24.670> them

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
a too high of a intensity we run them

a too high of a intensity we run them
way<00:02:25.030> too<00:02:25.060> fast<00:02:25.569> they're<00:02:25.900> kind<00:02:26.110> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
way too fast they're kind of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.440 
way too fast they're kind of
overachievers<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.849> basically<00:02:28.030> find

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
overachievers and if you basically find

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.199 
overachievers and if you basically find
yourself<00:02:28.959> running<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.130> hard<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.060> could

yourself running so hard that you could

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.360 
yourself running so hard that you could
only<00:02:31.330> mutter<00:02:31.690> single<00:02:32.560> syllable<00:02:33.040> words

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
only mutter single syllable words

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.720 
only mutter single syllable words
perhaps<00:02:34.060> expletives<00:02:34.900> or<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.250> start

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
perhaps expletives or if you start

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.750 
perhaps expletives or if you start
tasting<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.450> metallic<00:02:37.990> penny<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.160> copper

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
tasting the metallic penny like copper

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.020 
tasting the metallic penny like copper
whatever<00:02:40.480> taste<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:42.220> lactic<00:02:42.580> acid

whatever taste of the lactic acid
accumulating<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:43.990> your<00:02:44.110> bloodstream<00:02:44.319> you're

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
accumulating in your bloodstream you're

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.670 
accumulating in your bloodstream you're
probably<00:02:45.490> running<00:02:45.970> too<00:02:46.330> hard<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.560> got

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
probably running too hard that you got

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.460 
probably running too hard that you got
to<00:02:47.770> save<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:48.340> vo2<00:02:49.090> max<00:02:49.330> workouts<00:02:49.780> or<00:02:50.110> an

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
to save that for vo2 max workouts or an

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.430 
to save that for vo2 max workouts or an
aerobic<00:02:50.860> capacity<00:02:51.130> workouts<00:02:52.000> or<00:02:52.270> your<00:02:52.900> race

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
aerobic capacity workouts or your race

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.500 
aerobic capacity workouts or your race
day<00:02:53.709> performance<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.849> these<00:02:55.030> workouts<00:02:55.390> you

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
day performance so these workouts you

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.089 
day performance so these workouts you
really<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.900> kind<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.440> keep<00:02:56.620> yourself<00:02:56.739> in

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
really have to kind of keep yourself in

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.280 
really have to kind of keep yourself in
control<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.880> that's<00:02:58.120> part<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.660> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
control and that's part of the the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.140 
control and that's part of the the
aspect<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.220> them<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.520> makes<00:03:00.730> them<00:03:00.940> so

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
aspect of them that makes them so

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.650 
aspect of them that makes them so
difficult<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.870> pace<00:03:02.110> correctly
