three money to 25 and this home and I
grab<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.610> anti-gravity<00:00:35.610> vehicle<00:00:36.090> list

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.180 

ok<00:00:40.520> what's<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.170> responses<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
ok what's to do is responses and you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
ok what's to do is responses and you
make<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> through<00:00:44.640> spawned<00:00:44.969> time<00:00:45.270> 10<00:00:45.719> seconds

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
make it through spawned time 10 seconds

and you make it one time minimum to its

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
and you make it one time minimum to its
maximum<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.280> somebody<00:00:50.520> drive

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
this respond rate 180 seconds and you

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.060
