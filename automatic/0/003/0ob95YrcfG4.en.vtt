00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
Keith Miller's in for that Heath Miller
it<00:00:49.020> depends<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.700> remember<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> his

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it depends on I do not remember that his

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.299 
it depends on I do not remember that his
name<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.110> his<00:00:52.260> wand<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.649> better<00:00:52.860> received

name for his wand or better received

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.209

again<00:00:53.699> look<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.600> defense<00:00:54.960> player<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:56.010> he

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
again look one defense player if he

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
again look one defense player if he
plays<00:00:56.340> away<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.090> fifty<00:00:57.360> percent<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.289> he

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
plays away at fifty percent I think he

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.610 
plays away at fifty percent I think he
could<00:00:58.949> handle<00:00:59.160> him<00:00:59.489> let<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.620> they

could handle him let you know if they

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
could handle him let you know if they
are<00:01:01.649> holding<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.160> us<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.699> age<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.120> only

are holding out on us and age now only

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
are holding out on us and age now only
fifty<00:01:03.660> percent<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.140> he's<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> hundred

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
fifty percent when he's really a hundred

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
fifty percent when he's really a hundred
Heath<00:01:05.040> Miller<00:01:05.250> might<00:01:05.519> have
