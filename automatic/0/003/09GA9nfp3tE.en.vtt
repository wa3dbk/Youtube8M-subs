needed<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.769> think<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.459> fact<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.060> took

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
needed so I think the fact that it took

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.199 
needed so I think the fact that it took
a<00:02:38.299> little<00:02:38.510> while<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:39.410> overblown<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:41.030> that

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
a little while is overblown because that

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.880 
a little while is overblown because that
was<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.450> be<00:02:41.569> expected<00:02:41.599> not<00:02:42.260> something<00:02:42.769> that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
was to be expected not something that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.190 
was to be expected not something that
was<00:02:42.980> going<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.190> come<00:02:43.370> together<00:02:43.700> quickly<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
was going to come together quickly and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.550 
was going to come together quickly and
at<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.769> high<00:02:45.950> love<00:02:46.220> both<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.940> be<00:02:47.060> himself
