for<00:01:19.650> winter<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:21.450> during<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> summer<00:01:22.409> I'm

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
for winter and during the summer I'm

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
for winter and during the summer I'm
going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.759> almost<00:01:24.299> down<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.720> ground<00:01:25.140> right

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going to be almost down the ground right

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.030 
going to be almost down the ground right
here<00:01:25.490> really<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.610> low<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.829> fall

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
here really really low and then the fall

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940 
here really really low and then the fall
and<00:01:29.189> spring<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.950> put

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and spring it's about right here put

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
and spring it's about right here put
that<00:01:31.979> out<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.729> dependent<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.450> where

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that out that's all dependent on where

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.620 
that out that's all dependent on where
you're<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.729> what<00:01:35.729> angle<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.299> appeared

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you're at what angle that appeared

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
you're at what angle that appeared
you're<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.930> another<00:01:37.530> 10<00:01:37.770> 92

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you're at another 10 92

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.740 
you're at another 10 92
be<00:01:39.210> sure<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.390> have<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> simple

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
be sure to look it up and have a simple

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.920 
be sure to look it up and have a simple
connection<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> plugged<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.930> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
connection here have it plugged in to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.510 
connection here have it plugged in to
record<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.619> although<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.100> outputs

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
record there although the outputs

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
record there although the outputs
actually<00:01:47.880> coming<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.409> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
actually coming out of here and it's in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.300 
actually coming out of here and it's in
DC<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.720> there's<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.740> real<00:01:53.009> simple

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
DC and so there's this real simple

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.069 
DC and so there's this real simple
connection<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.509> want<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> put<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:54.990> in

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
connection if we want to put more in

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.770 
connection if we want to put more in
parallel<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.799> grab<00:01:56.009> another<00:01:56.219> cord

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
parallel we can just grab another cord

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.160 
parallel we can just grab another cord
just<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.990> basically<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> male<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.640> male<00:02:00.170> plug

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
just have basically a male to male plug

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.080 
just have basically a male to male plug
it<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.649> plug<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.250> into<00:02:02.369> another<00:02:02.579> over

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it in here and plug it into another over

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.289 
it in here and plug it into another over
another<00:02:03.479> hole<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.960> ray

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.580 

got<00:02:06.870> some<00:02:07.080> nice<00:02:07.290> frames<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.410> got

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
got some nice frames here then we got

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
got some nice frames here then we got
hinges<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.780> simple<00:02:13.080> door<00:02:13.470> hinges

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
hinges to get just a simple door hinges

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
hinges to get just a simple door hinges
of<00:02:13.980> course<00:02:14.190> they're<00:02:15.060> definitely<00:02:15.420> weather

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
of course they're definitely weather

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
of course they're definitely weather
resistant<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.700> these<00:02:17.819> are<00:02:17.880> like

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
resistant I think these are like

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.260 
resistant I think these are like
stainless<00:02:18.510> steel<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:20.490> that's<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.970> together

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
stainless steel and that's all together

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.510 
stainless steel and that's all together
the<00:02:21.450> whole<00:02:21.660> frame<00:02:22.580> was<00:02:23.580> about<00:02:24.020> 60<00:02:25.020> bucks<00:02:25.520> maybe

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the whole frame was about 60 bucks maybe

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.510 
the whole frame was about 60 bucks maybe
65<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.660> less<00:02:27.959> depending<00:02:28.319> on<00:02:28.410> working<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.400> your

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
65 or less depending on working at your

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.920 
65 or less depending on working at your
parts<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.260> these<00:02:31.260> are<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.590> quarter<00:02:32.250> inch
