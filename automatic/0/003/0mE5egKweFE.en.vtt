00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
market and one leads me to believe that

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.190 
market and one leads me to believe that
there's<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.090> they're<00:03:22.510> not<00:03:22.600> even<00:03:22.840> impact

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
there's not they're not even impact

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.490

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
that never put any special packs on the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.350 
that never put any special packs on the
game<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:51.050> coincide<00:04:51.740> with<00:04:51.770> Roy<00:04:52.610> Keane<00:04:52.940> being

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.650 
game to coincide with Roy Keane being
released<00:04:53.750> Eva<00:04:54.580> number<00:04:55.580> mad<00:04:56.090> off<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.510> I

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
released Eva number mad off and I

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.330 
released Eva number mad off and I
honestly<00:04:57.320> don't<00:04:57.470> think<00:04:57.590> he's<00:04:57.860> been<00:04:58.040> released
