00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
welcome to PC with kids Tech Talk well I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.250 
welcome to PC with kids Tech Talk well I
wanted<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> show<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.599> Kingston<00:00:16.080> HyperX

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
wanted to show you the Kingston HyperX

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.609 
wanted to show you the Kingston HyperX
two<00:00:17.250> gig<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.760> DDR<00:00:18.300> memory<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.960> had<00:00:19.199> because

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
two gig of DDR memory that I had because

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.130 
two gig of DDR memory that I had because
I<00:00:19.760> benchmarked<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.880> against<00:00:21.390> other<00:00:21.539> brands

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I benchmarked it against other brands

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
I benchmarked it against other brands
and<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.519> two<00:00:23.550> gigs

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and this one with two gigs

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.589 
and this one with two gigs
matched<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.140> beat<00:00:25.800> other<00:00:26.670> kits<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.300> were

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
matched or beat other kits that were

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320 
matched or beat other kits that were
four<00:00:28.080> gigs<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> really<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:30.119> note

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
four gigs so I really have to make note

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.600 
four gigs so I really have to make note
here<00:00:30.779> from<00:00:31.230> my<00:00:31.439> previous<00:00:31.710> benchmarks<00:00:32.460> when

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
here from my previous benchmarks when

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.639 
here from my previous benchmarks when
I've<00:00:32.730> used<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.210> ram<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> compared<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I've used this ram and compared it it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.650 
I've used this ram and compared it it
actually<00:00:34.890> does<00:00:35.399> better<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> little

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
actually does better now it is a little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.030 
actually does better now it is a little
bit<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:36.870> expensive<00:00:37.140> anywhere<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:37.890> like

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
bit more expensive anywhere from like

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.130 
bit more expensive anywhere from like
ten<00:00:38.430> twenty<00:00:38.940> thirty<00:00:38.969> dollars<00:00:39.690> depending<00:00:39.899> on

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
ten twenty thirty dollars depending on

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.850 
ten twenty thirty dollars depending on
which<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.340> brand<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:43.260> model<00:00:43.800> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
which which brand of the or model I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
which which brand of the or model I
should<00:00:44.040> say<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.820> HyperX<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.750> you're

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
should say of the HyperX that you're

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
should say of the HyperX that you're
getting<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> for

g.skill<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:05.970> lots

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
g.skill right I know that there's lots

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
g.skill right I know that there's lots
of<00:01:06.270> cool-looking<00:01:06.510> Ram<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.560> got

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of cool-looking Ram up there it's got

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
of cool-looking Ram up there it's got
nice<00:01:07.890> heat<00:01:08.130> spreaders<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.060> but

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
nice heat spreaders and all this but

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
nice heat spreaders and all this but
looks<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.320> everything<00:01:10.590> right<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
looks is not everything right on this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
looks is not everything right on this
system<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.720> using<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.500> can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
system that I'm using it on as you can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
system that I'm using it on as you can
see<00:01:13.890> I've<00:01:14.010> overclocked<00:01:14.670> everything<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:16.080> much

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
see I've overclocked everything as much

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660 
see I've overclocked everything as much
as<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.070> could

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
as I could

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.950 
as I could
okay<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.869> system<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.939> I<00:01:20.939> stress<00:01:21.479> tested

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
okay on this system and I stress tested

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
okay on this system and I stress tested
the<00:01:22.020> system<00:01:22.409> made<00:01:22.590> sure<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.759> gigs

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the system made sure that this two gigs

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810 
the system made sure that this two gigs
was<00:01:24.450> stable<00:01:25.020> right<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.250> overclocked

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
was stable right at these overclocked

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960 
was stable right at these overclocked
speeds<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.369> that's<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.610> thing<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
speeds and that's one thing that I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
speeds and that's one thing that I
wanted<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> point<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.860> right

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
wanted to point out here with this right

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
wanted to point out here with this right
is<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.210> overclock<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.530> don't

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is that you can overclock it you don't

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
is that you can overclock it you don't
have<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> worry<00:01:35.159> about<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have to worry about it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
have to worry about it
bringing<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.320> machine<00:01:37.759> it's<00:01:38.759> stable

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
bringing down your machine it's stable

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.539 
bringing down your machine it's stable
Ram<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.680> quality<00:01:40.920> lifetime

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
Ram and it's a good quality lifetime

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.600 
Ram and it's a good quality lifetime
warranty<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.590> when<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> benchmark<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.310> like

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
warranty and when I benchmark that like

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
warranty and when I benchmark that like
I<00:01:44.729> said<00:01:44.759> against<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> Patriot<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> Corsair

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
I said against the Patriot the Corsair

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.399 
I said against the Patriot the Corsair
the<00:01:46.799> OCZ<00:01:47.250> brands<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> I've<00:01:48.180> got<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.110> one

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the OCZ brands that I've got this one

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.460 
the OCZ brands that I've got this one
actually<00:01:49.680> beat<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.610> matched<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.930> them<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
actually beat or matched all of them and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually beat or matched all of them and
it<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.250> 2<00:01:53.430> gigs<00:01:53.670> compared<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it was just with 2 gigs compared to the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.929 
it was just with 2 gigs compared to the
other<00:01:54.509> ones<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> installed<00:01:55.560> 4<00:01:55.950> gigs<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
other ones that I installed 4 gigs so

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.719 
other ones that I installed 4 gigs so
imagine<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.719> installed<00:01:58.229> 4<00:01:58.979> gigs<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.579> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
imagine if I installed 4 gigs of this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.569 
imagine if I installed 4 gigs of this
instead<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.299> 2<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> memory<00:02:01.590> timings<00:02:01.979> 999

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
instead of 2 now the memory timings 999

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.440 
instead of 2 now the memory timings 999
27<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> used<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.409> course<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.329> when<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
27 is what I used of course and when it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.669 
27 is what I used of course and when it
comes<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.810> benchmarks<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:08.479> 47.9

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
comes to benchmarks here 47.9

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.260 
comes to benchmarks here 47.9
nanoseconds<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> latency<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.879> super

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
nanoseconds is latency so it's super

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.430 
nanoseconds is latency so it's super
fast

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
fast

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.250 
fast
to<00:02:13.620> other<00:02:13.770> brands<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.210> see<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
to other brands as you can see here the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.590 
to other brands as you can see here the
Patriot<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.950> OCZ<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> Corsair<00:02:18.060> they're

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
Patriot the OCZ in the Corsair they're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.310 
Patriot the OCZ in the Corsair they're
all<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.380> little<00:02:19.980> bit<00:02:20.100> slower<00:02:20.810> okay<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.080> that's

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
all a little bit slower okay so that's

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.630 
all a little bit slower okay so that's
one<00:02:22.530> thing<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.830> note<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.490> bat

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
one thing to note right off the bat

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.620 
one thing to note right off the bat
there<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.650> Kingston<00:02:26.130> HyperX<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.730> faster

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
there that the Kingston HyperX is faster

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.080 
there that the Kingston HyperX is faster
okay<00:02:28.260> no<00:02:28.500> doubt<00:02:28.710> about<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.160> including<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
okay no doubt about it including the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.500 
okay no doubt about it including the
read<00:02:30.800> megabytes<00:02:31.800> per<00:02:32.160> second<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:32.970> example

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
read megabytes per second for example

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.650 
read megabytes per second for example
definitely<00:02:34.500> faster<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:36.120> right<00:02:36.390> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
definitely faster there the right is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.190 
definitely faster there the right is
well<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> copy<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.770> all<00:02:38.190> scores<00:02:39.200> this

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
well and the copy on all scores this

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.030 
well and the copy on all scores this
HyperX

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
HyperX

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.030 
HyperX
beat<00:02:41.610> all<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:42.090> these<00:02:42.240> brands<00:02:42.660> okay<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.740> I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
beat all of these brands okay so I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.740 
beat all of these brands okay so I
really<00:02:44.100> had<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.670> make<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:45.000> note<00:02:45.210> here<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.600> just
