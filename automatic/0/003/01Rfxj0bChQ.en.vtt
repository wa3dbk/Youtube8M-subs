 don't have to be too 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.150
 clever finish a lot of academy to 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.720
 understand that something is wrong is niagara 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.940
 waterfall froze in Moscow 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.240
 got dressed 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.240
 January 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.280
 it wasn't always like that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.970
 she 'll tell you dad fine what was 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.600
 far from that time the snow lay 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 people always skate suddenly 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.710
 came to be with some strength and we 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710
 see 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.810
 tell me 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.000
 such a structure 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.740
 forehand 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.150
 predicts almost garden 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.730
 no 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.640
 it already shows here we give them 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:54.320
 forces and it turns out that society is not ready 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.530
 I start my squad in a panic, we think 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 shroud what to do 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.430
 they need to smoke less and then will not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.350
 change the glass balance of war to the planet 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.060
 ate 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.160
 it is human activity influenced the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.160
 the planet and the planet looks like this 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.260
 me so 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.640
 absolutely solar asset we go through 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:28.000
 certain sections of the galactic paths 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.400
 there are other frequencies of vibration and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.330
 the insides of our planet somehow 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.500
 way such 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.530
 Burul electromagnetic method we 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.190
 maybe the axis turns on and we need 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:48.250
 prepare for mass relocation 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.810
 whole countries and continents possible 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.110
 to be with force majeure cause 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 unexpected rise in world 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.610
 of the ocean 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.380
 what will happen massive 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.380
 uncontrolled migration of us at home 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 happen quickly 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.640
 but this is not a loss of control approach 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.640
 here they are 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.629
 only new scientific paradigm 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.019
 new technological opportunities when 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.680
 each to the wings becomes flying 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:28.840
 objects and every inhabitant of the planet will 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.360
 maybe it's saved or not see 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.930
