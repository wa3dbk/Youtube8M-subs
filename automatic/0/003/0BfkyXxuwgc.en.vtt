switch so to get a third flight mode you
have<00:00:17.360> to<00:00:17.510> program<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:18.230> transmitters<00:00:18.920> channel

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
have to program the transmitters channel

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.790 
have to program the transmitters channel
mixer<00:00:19.880> first<00:00:20.510> we'll<00:00:20.720> set<00:00:20.930> up<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.080> gear<00:00:21.500> switch

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
mixer first we'll set up the gear switch

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.580 
mixer first we'll set up the gear switch
to<00:00:22.130> activate<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.880> attitude<00:00:23.450> and<00:00:23.750> GPS<00:00:24.260> flight

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
to activate the attitude and GPS flight

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.770 
to activate the attitude and GPS flight
modes<00:00:24.890> then<00:00:25.400> we'll<00:00:25.610> program<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.270> mix<00:00:26.480> switch

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
modes then we'll program the mix switch

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.440 
modes then we'll program the mix switch
to<00:00:27.110> act<00:00:27.290> as<00:00:27.560> a<00:00:27.590> virtual<00:00:28.100> 3rd<00:00:28.400> position<00:00:28.670> on<00:00:29.180> the
