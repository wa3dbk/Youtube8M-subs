Hello everyone and welcome to lovinpix TV

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.240
Today we'll show you how to properly use a video monopod

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.360
If had to choose

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.360
a stabilizing accessory, I would take this one

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.760
Why? It is much lighter than a video tripod

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.780
which is much more convenient to carry when traveling
Why? It is much lighter than a video tripod

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.200
which is much more convenient to carry when traveling

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.460
It is also more versatile than a tripod 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.040
It will allow you to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040
to perform a large number of camera movements

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.040
and stabilizing your images too

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.760
Before starting I recommend to buy monopods with a platform for HDDSLR

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.560
If you add a fluid head you can film more aesthetic shots

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.160
Here we have our favorite monopod , P-224S, from Sirui brand

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.000
and we'll show you how we use it during our shootings

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.580
We took the Panasonic GH4 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.840
Prefer a monopod with a base with three retractable legs

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.840
They will give you more stability

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.840
even on rough or slippery surfaces

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.960
With these you can also place the monopod on the floor

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.120
to use it like a tripod

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.220
if your set up is not stable

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.600
you can adjust the friction of the base using an Allen key

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.760
or directly with a friction ring

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.840
You can adjust the height of the monopod by unfolding sections of it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.120
When you have shots to film at ground

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.860
or that fly over a scene

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.460
You only have to adjust the height and then filming

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.340
When I use a monopod , I always make sure to keep it close to my body

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.100
This symbiosis will eliminate a maximum of tremors

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.780
Allowing you to make fluid shots : more pros

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.980
The fluid head lever will also be an asset in your shootings

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.240
You can block it on or below your shoulder when shooting

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.260
You will get more stability
You can block it on or below your shoulder when shooting

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.740

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.960
Here are some shots that can be achieved with a video monopod

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.640
Finally the monopod is a must have for all videomakers

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.220
 of events or weddings who need to obtain stable shots quickly

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220
to dont miss any good moment

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.080
The monopod is the accessory that will bring you the best

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.420
stability / mobility report , much more than a tripod for example

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.920
You can find the equipment used in the description

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.700
