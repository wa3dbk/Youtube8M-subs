00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.969
 girls all hello today i 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.340
 I open a series of videos about styling and pro 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.990
 my collection of laying appliances then 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.360
 I will show you separately 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
 each device and dedicate to it a separate 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.710
 video what kind of clutch can be with his 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.500
 I have been using it for quite some time 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.330
 exhibited photo in instagram and and then I 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.429
 showed absolutely his entire collection 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 she is not small I have become more 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.629
 I'm not a hairstyle but I 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.070
 really like a curl I really like 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.949
 experiment 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 it is with some styling that's why I 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.820
 I hope that these videos will be for you 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.979
 I find it useful in everyday life 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 so much of course not necessary but by virtue 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.089
 the fact that I am a beauty blogger I have accumulated 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.699
 a certain amount of these all 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.559
 appliances and maybe you need some 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.900
 certain effect you'll watch 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.150
 these videos and understand exactly what you need 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.489
 You will be the first video dedicated here 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.030
 this styling device is triple 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.330
 curling iron to create it is the newest 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.189
 device in my collection and I already often and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 video about him told you and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.329
 appeared in such a way and now 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.649
 I want to tell you a little about him and 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.259
 show what effect 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.450
 I already included this curling here there are two 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.420
 buttons on and off when 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.240
 off she red light up and when 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.969
 now turned on green lights 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.070
 it heats up not quickly immediately then 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.869
 there will take a little time what 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.939
 Regarding temperatures, then in the little book 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.039
 indicated what temperature for what 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.469
 hair type is suitable I will leave 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.990
 practically very big is 23 but there is 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.359
 20 more because either I will deliver 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.009
 I will keep the little one for a long time either I 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.869
 I 'll put a lot a little less 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.999
 keep basically the same effect 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.159
 ceramic curling iron itself 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.119
 this brand is by the way babyliss pro that is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.340
 professionally 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.259
 There is the same from not professional 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.880
 ruler do not know how they differ 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.979
 I stayed this pretty curling 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.109
 totally I really like the effects 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 I use it often enough 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.219
 then when i need to extend freshness 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.649
 hair because plus one day she 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.170
 adds to fresh hair usually if 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.510
 wash your hair once every two days then with this curling 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.220
 you will wash every three days somewhere 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.880
 there is it on the roots somehow a little bit 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.319
 dries hair and i like it and 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.790
 she also lends 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.890
 crazy volume depends on 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.159
 how much will you keep it all on 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.680
 hair up you can say that in principle 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.049
 braid pigtails well how many said 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.650
 and will even harm less i'm not so 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.599
 I think 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.189
 explain why because when 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.439
 I use this curling I will 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.689
 I use thermal protection she doesn't care 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.790
 prevents dry hair thereby 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.560
 she warns and breakage damage 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.329
 Hair, that is, heat protection is very 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.549
 good thing and use it absolutely 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.829
 under any styling or we weave 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.120
 pigtails on she that first pigtails to me 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.489
 Must be on wet hair 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 braid if you braid on wet 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.439
 the hair then accordingly i will have them 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.719
 combing thereby hurting i'm talking 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.639
 constantly that i'm wet hair i never 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.439
 I do not comb it because they are the most 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.439
 fragile at this moment they most 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.669
 torn break then appear 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.680
 split ends even if you will 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.930
 use wooden combs either 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.599
 tangle teezer hair anyway 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.500
 reach for break stretch and they 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.120
 getting thinner 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.370
 and the second thing i like when i am 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.469
 for example I make pigtails all is well here 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.109
 here starting from here that's how we weave 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.389
 pigtail volume cool but here they are 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.919
 how slick turns out and still 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.259
 need to use started of course 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.269
 everyone decides for himself and told them how 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.470
 I consider the pros and cons of braids and here 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.629
 this here is curling 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.069
 so for me I still choose the curling 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.769
 definitely curling almost 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.650
 warmed up and now what i do i will 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.599
 to separate the rows of hair I still come 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.220
 to the conclusion that this is most convenient for me 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.439
 do any styling on my hair 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.209
 I separate the first layer of hair in principle 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.519
 you can take more 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.500
 I'm not in favor of the foam musa and so on to me 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.560
 still like here such means as 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.540
 for example textures azer from sebastian it 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.819
 such as kei I really like that he 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.359
 fits and knocked straight hair under 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.609
 wavy and forgery anne thereby i like 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.430
 I would fix the laying it is still a plus 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.829
 has thermal barrier properties and the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.389
 There is this and care and such laying 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.849
 means up in one while he 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.310
 leaves styling moving shiny 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.409
 there is no such effect cementing on 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 hair love this means I'm 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:29.370
 so here on every layer of hair on our 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.169
 separately in order to just styling 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.610
 kept 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.830
 longer though possible in principle 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.499
 use and on all hair at once 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.360
 I give a little bit to dry this tool 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.719
 to not wet hair styled 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.849
 and proceed further to laying our heated 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:50.779
 device and i do starting from the back strands 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.990
 and i'm starting right from the beginning 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:58.300
 somewhere here so here because closer to 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.300
 I have roots in the upper strands do 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.789
 and one more that I forgot to tell me 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.360
 for example more like when this one 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.270
 by the side 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.430
 I put it like this 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.380
 back because so waves are more 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.090
 separated yes that's more so 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.090
 structural is obtained 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.280
 on the one hand, the waves are already ready as 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.160
 see here I have already begun here by retreating 1 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.230
 centimeter somewhere from the roots and continue 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.900
 on the second side separated a small 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.810
 hair strand and practically at the most 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.150
 the roots of this one side and the thicker 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.400
 strand the more keep curling on 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.980
 hair i usually on thicker such 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.340
 strands at a temperature of 23 in this curling 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.310
 keep somewhere up to 15 think if thin 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.000
 a strand I can count i done to those and to 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.000
 10 mm 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.340
 and that's what we did and now 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.190
 these are hide and seek since they are all right 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.160
 go need fingers just divide me 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.140
 I do not like to comb it for example already 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.600
 2 or on the third day, what they are 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.210
 very fluffy very voluminous 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.140
 it becomes therefore I am fingers like this 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.110
 here I share 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.530
 and here we have such beautiful and voluminous 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.990
 hair volume styling is obtained like me 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.960
 and said this is the biggest plus of this 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.540
 styling and i like the fact that you can 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.030
 use as on short hair 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.820
 on medium visual here for example on 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.710
 box where we have a box here 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.410
 on short is also very cool very 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.620
 stylish look is styling + like me 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.270
 said hair freshness is extended on 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.770
 today that's all i wanted you 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.900
 tell and show necessarily 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.390
 like if you like 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.550
 such an idea video with styling 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.800
 and with laying devices and i will 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.870
 continue this video series on this 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.870
 see you all in the new videos for now
