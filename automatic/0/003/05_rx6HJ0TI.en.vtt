00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
it and a third pile that's very Brown

it and a third pile that's very Brown
very<00:02:11.799> rich<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.519> warm<00:02:13.349> three<00:02:14.349> different<00:02:14.890> piles

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
very rich and warm three different piles

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.369 
very rich and warm three different piles
from<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.209> collection<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.049> set<00:02:17.260> aside

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
from the collection that I set aside

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.449 
from the collection that I set aside
based<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.159> fact<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.939> I<00:02:19.030> liked<00:02:19.329> the<00:02:19.780> colors

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
based on fact that I liked the colors

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.500 
based on fact that I liked the colors
looking<00:02:21.459> at<00:02:21.609> these<00:02:21.790> I'm<00:02:22.060> going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.239> spread

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
looking at these I'm going to spread

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.970 
looking at these I'm going to spread
them<00:02:22.719> out<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:25.090> idea<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.109> take<00:02:26.709> that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
them out the idea here is to take that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.119 
them out the idea here is to take that
bunch<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:28.120> colors<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.689> like<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.379> put

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
bunch of colors that you like and put

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.750 
bunch of colors that you like and put
them<00:02:30.310> into<00:02:30.489> subsets<00:02:31.709> based<00:02:32.709> on<00:02:32.980> each<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
them into subsets based on each of the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520 
them into subsets based on each of the
clippings<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.359> what<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.659> showing<00:02:34.989> up<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.349> the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
clippings and what is showing up in the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.009 
clippings and what is showing up in the
color<00:02:35.769> scheme<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.489> clipping<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.659> not

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
color scheme of that clipping it's not

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.319 
color scheme of that clipping it's not
an<00:02:38.500> exercise<00:02:38.859> about<00:02:39.280> does<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.909> clipping

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
an exercise about does this clipping

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.599 
an exercise about does this clipping
look<00:02:40.750> good<00:02:40.959> with<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.799> clipping<00:02:42.129> I'm<00:02:42.400> not

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
look good with this clipping I'm not

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.179 
look good with this clipping I'm not
creating<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.510> color<00:02:43.780> scheme<00:02:44.200> I'm<00:02:44.650> documenting

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
creating a color scheme I'm documenting

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.660 
creating a color scheme I'm documenting
a<00:02:45.909> color<00:02:46.150> scheme<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:48.069> documents

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
a color scheme so this one documents

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.009 
a color scheme so this one documents
that's<00:02:48.849> something<00:02:49.150> that's<00:02:49.329> very<00:02:49.450> playful

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
that's something that's very playful

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.140 
that's something that's very playful
very<00:02:50.260> fun<00:02:50.889> and<00:02:51.129> I<00:02:51.189> think<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.879> one<00:02:52.030> I'm

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
on top so you can see how much the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.180 
on top so you can see how much the
colors<00:04:33.650> are<00:04:33.830> inspired<00:04:34.220> by<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.550> collage<00:04:39.190> so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
colors are inspired by the collage so

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.090 
colors are inspired by the collage so
the<00:04:41.180> colors<00:04:41.570> were<00:04:41.810> definitely<00:04:42.530> taken<00:04:42.980> from

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
the colors were definitely taken from

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.800 
the colors were definitely taken from
the<00:04:43.220> collage<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:43.700> that's<00:04:43.910> not<00:04:44.210> all

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
the collage but that's not all

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.280 
the collage but that's not all
there's<00:04:45.020> also<00:04:46.570> compositional<00:04:47.570> choices<00:04:48.110> that

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
there's also compositional choices that

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.050 
there's also compositional choices that
I<00:04:48.380> made<00:04:48.560> based<00:04:48.860> on<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.100> collage<00:04:49.550> about<00:04:49.910> the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
I made based on a collage about the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.630 
I made based on a collage about the
shape<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:51.500> leaves<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.190> necklace

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
shape of the leaves in the necklace

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.210 
shape of the leaves in the necklace
there's<00:04:52.940> in<00:04:53.260> also<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.440> darks<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.130> lights

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
there's some of the textural stuff going

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.920

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
on so you can see the collage can be

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.120 
on so you can see the collage can be
used<00:05:00.140> not<00:05:00.380> just<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:01.310> get<00:05:02.000> color<00:05:02.830> ideas<00:05:03.830> but<00:05:04.040> it

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
can also be used to get compositional

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.160 
can also be used to get compositional
