00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that I think of it I think it might have

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
that I think of it I think it might have
had<00:01:09.060> something<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> stomach<00:01:10.310> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
had something to do with the stomach so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.760 
had something to do with the stomach so
we<00:01:11.460> strapped<00:01:11.790> into<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.270> roller<00:01:12.540> coaster<00:01:12.770> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
we strapped into this roller coaster so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
we strapped into this roller coaster so
we<00:01:13.979> thinks<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> he's<00:01:15.240> sitting<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.630> next<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
we thinks and he's sitting there next to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
we thinks and he's sitting there next to
this<00:01:16.320> woman<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.460> assuming<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
this woman and I'm assuming that this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
this woman and I'm assuming that this
woman<00:01:18.479> wasn't<00:01:18.840> his<00:01:19.080> mother<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:19.860> calls
