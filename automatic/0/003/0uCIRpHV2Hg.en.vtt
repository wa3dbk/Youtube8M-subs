with the white I can work the white into
the<00:02:30.120> orange<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.159> make<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the orange so that you can make a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.110 
the orange so that you can make a
different<00:02:32.790> color<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.989> white<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.120> rust

a dimension I always say when you use
two<00:04:17.380> colors<00:04:17.620> your<00:04:18.070> kind<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.489> two-dimensional

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
two colors your kind of two-dimensional

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.560 
two colors your kind of two-dimensional

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.510 
and when you use three or more colors
you<00:04:22.570> get<00:04:22.780> into<00:04:23.110> three<00:04:23.380> dimensions<00:04:26.280> I'll<00:04:27.280> add<00:04:27.460> a

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
you get into three dimensions I'll add a

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.830 
you get into three dimensions I'll add a
little<00:04:27.760> yellow<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.390> neck
