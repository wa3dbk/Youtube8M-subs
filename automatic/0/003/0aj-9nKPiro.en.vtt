SD card well it's because your SD cards
made<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.350> loads<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> partitions<00:00:56.610> and

made out of loads of the partitions and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
made out of loads of the partitions and
there's<00:00:57.570> certain<00:00:57.840> partition<00:00:58.260> start<00:00:58.440> windows

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
there's certain partition start windows

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.400 
there's certain partition start windows
in<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.129> case<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.670> can<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.930> cannot<00:01:01.170> read

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
in this case I can and cannot read

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.039 
in this case I can and cannot read
windows<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.190> only<00:01:02.309> read<00:01:02.550> certain<00:01:03.300> partitions

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
windows can only read certain partitions

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
windows can only read certain partitions
that<00:01:04.580> are<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.880> fat<00:01:06.530> format<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.240> that's<00:01:09.240> why

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that are in a fat format and that's why

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.520 
that are in a fat format and that's why
i<00:01:09.360> said<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.720> you've<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> linux<00:01:10.229> machine

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
i said if you've got a linux machine

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.660 
i said if you've got a linux machine
it's<00:01:10.680> even<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> can

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it's even better because then it can

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.980 
it's even better because then it can
read<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> partitions<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.840> it's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
read all of the partitions because it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.679 
read all of the partitions because it's
linux<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.330> worry<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.600> has

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
linux and so don't worry if it's has

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.070 
linux and so don't worry if it's has
only<00:01:15.840> 55<00:01:16.259> megabytes<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.740> space<00:01:17.990> we're<00:01:18.990> going

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
only 55 megabytes of space we're going

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
only 55 megabytes of space we're going
to<00:01:19.140> need<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.060> far<00:01:21.330> here

saw<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.580> eraasi<00:02:08.849> part<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> do

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
saw on eraasi part you can have to do

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.260 
saw on eraasi part you can have to do
this<00:02:10.020> manually<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.430> need<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> find<00:02:11.970> out

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
this manually so we need to find out

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.290 
this manually so we need to find out
certain<00:02:12.569> things

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
certain things

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.590 
certain things
so<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:13.840> frequency<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.740> one<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:16.420> set

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
so I'm frequency this one here it's set

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.670 
so I'm frequency this one here it's set
to<00:02:16.630> 900<00:02:17.320> my<00:02:18.160> guys<00:02:18.340> here<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.140> arm<00:02:20.140> frequency<00:02:20.620> is

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to 900 my guys here and arm frequency is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160 
to 900 my guys here and arm frequency is
a<00:02:20.740> cpu<00:02:21.160> speed<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.270> if<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.690> decrease<00:02:23.050> that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
a cpu speed so if you decrease that

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.900 
a cpu speed so if you decrease that
about<00:02:23.500> 800<00:02:23.950> megahertz<00:02:24.160> if<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:24.640> still<00:02:24.790> not

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
about 800 megahertz if it's still not

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.830 
about 800 megahertz if it's still not
working<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.770> if<00:02:26.980> we<00:02:27.100> scroll<00:02:27.280> along<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
working then if we scroll along with it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.000 
working then if we scroll along with it
we're<00:02:28.840> going<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.050> see<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.230> call<00:02:29.470> frequency

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
we're going to see the call frequency

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.580 
we're going to see the call frequency
here<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.780> one<00:02:34.960> change<00:02:35.530> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
here and that that one change that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.170 
here and that that one change that
number<00:02:35.830> depending<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.490> how<00:02:36.610> fast<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.090> want

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
number depending on how fast you want

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.380 
number depending on how fast you want
your<00:02:37.330> chief<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:37.660> GPUs<00:02:38.500> bleed<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.040> go<00:02:39.390> oops

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
your chief here GPUs bleed to go oops

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
your chief here GPUs bleed to go oops
and<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.020> we<00:02:41.170> scroll<00:02:41.410> along<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.680> little<00:02:41.950> bit

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and then we scroll along a little bit

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.570 
and then we scroll along a little bit
further<00:02:43.290> we're<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.500> see<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.830> SRAM

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
further we're going to see the SRAM

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.560 
further we're going to see the SRAM
frequency<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> RAM<00:02:49.210> as<00:02:49.450> I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
frequency and that's just the RAM as I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.170 
frequency and that's just the RAM as I
said<00:02:49.720> before<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.290> 450<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.340> again<00:02:51.820> if

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
said before and that's 450 so again if

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.300 
said before and that's 450 so again if
you<00:02:52.270> want<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.600> decrease<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.280> decrease<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
you want to decrease that decrease that

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.350 
you want to decrease that decrease that
number<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.910> then<00:02:55.570> we're<00:02:55.780> also<00:02:55.900> going<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.170> see

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
number and then we're also going to see

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.720 
number and then we're also going to see
the<00:02:58.360> over<00:02:58.810> voltage<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.010> go<00:03:00.370> on<00:03:00.610> to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the over voltage so this is to go on to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.300 
the over voltage so this is to go on to
decrease<00:03:01.120> increase<00:03:01.540> etc<00:03:02.230> etc<00:03:02.290> etc<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.040> you're

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
decrease increase etc etc etc so you're

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.160 
decrease increase etc etc etc so you're
going<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.460> get<00:03:03.580> more<00:03:03.790> options<00:03:04.180> here<00:03:04.480> so

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
going to get more options here so

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.230 
going to get more options here so
possibly<00:03:06.040> i'll<00:03:06.220> push<00:03:06.460> my<00:03:06.610> eyes<00:03:06.790> apply<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
possibly i'll push my eyes apply all the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.210 
possibly i'll push my eyes apply all the
way<00:03:07.300> up<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.440> 1200<00:03:08.440> maker<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:08.770> 1.2

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
way up to 1200 maker that's 1.2

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.180 
way up to 1200 maker that's 1.2
gigahertz<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:11.380> was<00:03:11.470> stable<00:03:11.770> for<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> few

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
gigahertz and that was stable for a few

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.900 
gigahertz and that was stable for a few
hours<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.420> that's<00:03:13.630> how<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:14.700> change<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.820> on

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
hours and so that's how to change it on

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.729 
hours and so that's how to change it on
a<00:03:16.000> Windows<00:03:16.270> PC<00:03:16.680> that's<00:03:17.680> basically<00:03:18.010> how<00:03:18.280> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
a Windows PC that's basically how to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.979 
a Windows PC that's basically how to
overclock<00:03:20.739> your<00:03:20.860> pie<00:03:21.420> once<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.540> finish<00:03:22.840> doing

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
overclock your pie once you finish doing

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.949 
overclock your pie once you finish doing
this<00:03:23.140> save<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.820> file<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.180> put<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:25.690> back<00:03:25.750> into

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
this save the file and put it back into

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.479 
this save the file and put it back into
your<00:03:26.020> pie<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.440> boot<00:03:26.650> up<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:27.070> still<00:03:27.280> doesn't

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
your pie and boot up it still doesn't

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.170 
your pie and boot up it still doesn't
work<00:03:27.550> come<00:03:27.910> back<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:29.940> hope<00:03:30.940> you've
