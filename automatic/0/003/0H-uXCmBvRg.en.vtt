00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
I guess so you know I explained to him I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
I guess so you know I explained to him I
said<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.939> change

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
said I don't think it's that they change

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.899 
said I don't think it's that they change
their<00:01:33.360> formula<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.909> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
their formula I think it's just that you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.580 
their formula I think it's just that you
know<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> rave<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> natural

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
know it's all the rave in the natural

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.940 
know it's all the rave in the natural
hair<00:01:37.770> community<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.049> people<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.290> trying<00:01:40.590> it

hair community and people are trying it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
hair community and people are trying it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
but it's one of those thin things that's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.190 
but it's one of those thin things that's
too<00:01:43.020> expensive<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.880> try<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.990> not

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
too expensive to try and then have not

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.100 
too expensive to try and then have not
work<00:01:46.549> plus<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.939> big<00:01:48.210> giant<00:01:48.450> jar<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
work plus you get this big giant jar of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.600 
work plus you get this big giant jar of
it<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.799> you're<00:01:49.950> never<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> use<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it and if you're never going to use it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
it and if you're never going to use it
again<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:50.970> seems<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> waste<00:01:51.659> so
