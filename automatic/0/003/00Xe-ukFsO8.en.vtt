00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.760 
it's just got that basic little heater
that's<00:06:03.570> supposed<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:03.870> be<00:06:03.900> for<00:06:04.110> 10<00:06:04.320> gallon<00:06:04.620> but

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
that's supposed to be for 10 gallon but

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.850 
that's supposed to be for 10 gallon but
it<00:06:04.860> holds<00:06:04.979> my<00:06:05.219> water<00:06:05.490> in<00:06:05.729> here<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:07.440> can't<00:06:07.469> see

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it holds my water in here you can't see

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.100 
it holds my water in here you can't see
because<00:06:07.979> it's<00:06:08.190> all<00:06:08.340> dirty<00:06:08.610> probably<00:06:09.180> but

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.779 

anyways<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.289> holds<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:13.620> at<00:06:13.740> about<00:06:13.949> 78<00:06:14.490> degrees

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
anyways it holds it at about 78 degrees

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.439 
anyways it holds it at about 78 degrees
which<00:06:15.300> is<00:06:15.330> perfect<00:06:16.520> just<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.729> hang<00:06:18.030> on<00:06:18.210> bio

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
which is perfect just a hang on bio

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.709 
which is perfect just a hang on bio

bags<00:06:32.520> I<00:06:32.789> don't<00:06:32.940> know<00:06:33.000> how<00:06:33.089> much<00:06:33.210> it<00:06:33.389> helps<00:06:33.659> but

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
bags I don't know how much it helps but

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.090 
bags I don't know how much it helps but
figured<00:06:34.770> what<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:34.949> hell<00:06:35.159> I'm<00:06:35.279> not<00:06:35.310> out

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
figured what the hell I'm not out

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.830 
figured what the hell I'm not out
and<00:06:36.370> you<00:06:36.760> know<00:06:36.880> what<00:06:36.970> obviously<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.510> corals

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
and you know what obviously the corals

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.950 
and you know what obviously the corals
are<00:06:38.050> reacting<00:06:38.560> well<00:06:38.740> to<00:06:38.770> it<00:06:39.240> i'm<00:06:40.240> not<00:06:40.480> i'm<00:06:40.900> not

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
are reacting well to it i'm not i'm not

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.510 
are reacting well to it i'm not i'm not
losing<00:06:41.230> corals<00:06:41.770> in<00:06:41.920> here<00:06:42.220> so<00:06:44.040> it's<00:06:45.040> actually<00:06:45.250> i

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
losing corals in here so it's actually i

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.890 
losing corals in here so it's actually i
don't<00:06:45.670> know<00:06:45.850> it's<00:06:45.940> more<00:06:46.060> of<00:06:46.180> a<00:06:46.240> hospital<00:06:46.420> tank

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
don't know it's more of a hospital tank

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.510 
don't know it's more of a hospital tank
than<00:06:47.080> anything<00:06:47.380> it's<00:06:47.500> actually<00:06:47.650> recovering

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
than anything it's actually recovering

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.940 
than anything it's actually recovering
the<00:06:49.060> couple<00:06:49.840> of<00:06:49.930> corals<00:06:50.230> that<00:06:50.350> don't<00:06:50.590> do<00:06:50.770> well

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
the couple of corals that don't do well

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.780 
the couple of corals that don't do well
in<00:06:51.100> my<00:06:51.220> mains<00:06:51.430> so<00:06:51.900> that<00:06:52.900> simply<00:06:53.620> and<00:06:53.860> you<00:06:54.700> know

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
in my mains so that simply and you know

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.460 
in my mains so that simply and you know
endo<00:06:55.270> power<00:06:55.480> head<00:06:55.720> for<00:06:55.900> a<00:06:55.930> little<00:06:56.140> bit<00:06:56.320> of

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
endo power head for a little bit of

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.400 
endo power head for a little bit of
added<00:06:57.090> you<00:06:58.090> know<00:06:58.120> flow<00:06:58.510> in<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.810> tank<00:06:59.050> but

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
added you know flow in the tank but

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.080 
added you know flow in the tank but
that's<00:06:59.710> simply<00:07:00.040> you<00:07:00.220> can<00:07:00.250> have<00:07:00.610> a<00:07:00.640> tank

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
that's simply you can have a tank

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.710 
that's simply you can have a tank
growing<00:07:01.980> SPS<00:07:02.980> perfectly<00:07:03.760> there's<00:07:04.450> nothing

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
growing SPS perfectly there's nothing

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.050 
growing SPS perfectly there's nothing
wrong<00:07:05.050> that<00:07:05.110> SPS<00:07:05.680> is<00:07:05.890> growing<00:07:06.310> plate<00:07:06.610> corals

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
wrong that SPS is growing plate corals

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.150 
wrong that SPS is growing plate corals
growing<00:07:07.360> zoanthids<00:07:08.110> are<00:07:08.230> growing<00:07:08.560> obviously

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
growing zoanthids are growing obviously

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.560 
growing zoanthids are growing obviously
it's<00:07:09.280> supporting<00:07:09.700> an<00:07:09.790> enemies<00:07:10.150> because<00:07:10.360> it's

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
it's supporting an enemies because it's

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.840 
it's supporting an enemies because it's
split<00:07:10.840> into<00:07:10.870> three<00:07:13.350> you<00:07:14.350> know<00:07:14.470> pallys<00:07:15.460> they're

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
split into three you know pallys they're

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.430 
split into three you know pallys they're
doing<00:07:16.180> well<00:07:16.420> it<00:07:16.810> can<00:07:17.020> support<00:07:17.230> plate<00:07:17.710> coral

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 
doing well it can support plate coral

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.580 
doing well it can support plate coral
obviously<00:07:20.440> it's<00:07:20.680> a<00:07:21.220> Cannes<00:07:21.910> so<00:07:22.630> that's<00:07:23.020> simple

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
obviously it's a Cannes so that's simple

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.920 
obviously it's a Cannes so that's simple
