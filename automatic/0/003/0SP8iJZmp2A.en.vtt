 2013 What is the brigades program? 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 civil defense at school since the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.590
 beginning of this government saw if there 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 the need for schools to adapt to the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.539
 standards for fire safety and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.399
 panic of the fire department is in 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.730
 virtue of constant updates 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.739
 these standards are the schools end up 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.719
 getting somewhat out of date 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.480
 then formed a working group 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.640
 composed of civil defense officers and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.539

 program is based on the decree 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 state 4837 now let's talk a little 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 on the structure of the program 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.509
 basically composed of three axes. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.939
 first axis is the training the second 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.829
 is the adequacy of the schools to the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.150
 fire safety and panic 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.340
 Fire Department 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.060
 finally the third axis is the formation 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.700
 of school brigades, the program is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.299
 composed basically of three 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.100
 spheres of action we have to 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.990
 state coordination that is composed of the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.899

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.450
 also the regional coordination which is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.280
 composed by six people 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.890

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.819
 school and finally we have 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.950
 our local coordinators that the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.880
 director a teacher and a third 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.660
 member of the brigade 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.080
 in the year of 2012 we had the intense 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 work is in the first semester then 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.060
 was the formatting of the program 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.070
 already in the second half after the launch 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.710
 there was an intense work of 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.080
 training at various levels 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.610
 At first we had the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.870
 training of our managers 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.750
 regional 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.990
 this training was coordinated by the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.510
 state coordination of the program and we 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.600
 we then proceed in three steps in 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.400
 curitiba in three municipalities curitiba 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.800
 maringÃ¡ and rattlesnake 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.190
 later our managers 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.250
 regional authorities to multiply the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.050
 several municipalities of the state then 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 transfer this knowledge to the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.120
 our local managers who are 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.550

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.080
 school and a third member of 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.750
 school brigade 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.240
 subsequently the training already 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.130
 end of the year we had the formation of 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.580
 Our first class of brigadistas 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.970
 is about 850 students. 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.420
 have successfully concluded is the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.450
 distance learning that was tutor yada 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.220
 by members of firefighters 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.070
 various state units 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.770
 our target for 2013 is in a first 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.650
 time to make feedback with our 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.740
 firefighters tutors in distance learning 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.940
 later we will form a new class 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.650
 60 tutors 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.750
 of the various units of the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.580
 state 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.190
 after that, we will do a recap 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.320
 for those people to those servers 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.050
 of the various schools that for some 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.450
 reason they could not participate in the 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.390
 capacity building of local 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.360
 and finally it is mid-year to the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.760
 Finally, we will form new 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.340
 classes of school brigade 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.400
 our goal is to form something around 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.620
 4,000 new school 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.930
 several schools in our state 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.970
 to finish my speech could not 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.950
 stop thanking all of you 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.350
 members of the school community who 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.760
 They helped us who worked with us. 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.150
 in 2012 and urge everyone else 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.850
 once we can unite our 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.100
 efforts to get our hands on a 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.760
 excellent 2013 year 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.940
 remembering that today is the world 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.280
 and our country is our 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.370
 state has sometimes been affected 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.290
 by some natural disasters that 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.940
 notes that today our 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.070
 adults are often not 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.710
 prepared to deal with this type 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.280
 situation and objective with this program 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.990
 is to change this culture in our children 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.590
 in our teens so that in 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.200
 become more mature adults 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.600
 to cope with collaborating with 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.430
 public authorities in a possible 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.820
 catastrophe is a type of situation like 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.820
 That
