00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
however beds cannot be moved by Pistons

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.439 
however beds cannot be moved by Pistons
just<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.680> show<00:00:17.039> an<00:00:17.160> example<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:20.210> this<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
just to show an example here this is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.900 
just to show an example here this is
with<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.900> pistons<00:00:22.769> below<00:00:23.100> pushing<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> block

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
with the pistons below pushing the block

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
with the pistons below pushing the block
up<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.230> bed<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> sitting<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.800> just

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
up which a bed is sitting on and I just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
up which a bed is sitting on and I just
see<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.279> broke<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> pushing

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
see it broke and this is with it pushing

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.990 
see it broke and this is with it pushing
it<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> side<00:00:32.059> broke<00:00:33.059> however<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.320> can

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
it to the side broke however you can

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
it to the side broke however you can
pull<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.270> blocks<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.410> underneath<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
pull the blocks out from underneath and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
pull the blocks out from underneath and
the<00:00:39.170> bed<00:00:40.170> will<00:00:40.350> stay<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> knowing<00:00:43.050> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the bed will stay there so knowing this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
the bed will stay there so knowing this
we<00:00:43.469> cannot<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.190> much<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we cannot really do much about the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.040 
we cannot really do much about the
position<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> bed<00:00:46.820> I<00:00:47.820> came<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.629> some

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
position of the bed I came up with some

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.459 
position of the bed I came up with some
designs<00:00:49.789> for<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> bedroom<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.480> here's<00:00:52.079> one

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
designs for the bedroom and here's one

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
designs for the bedroom and here's one
of<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:53.090> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.110> using

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of them this is not that what I'm using

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
of them this is not that what I'm using
but<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> cool<00:00:57.030> problem<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
but this is kind of cool problem is I

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.210 
but this is kind of cool problem is I
don't<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.260> exposed<00:00:59.219> pistons<00:00:59.820> too<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:04.220> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
don't like exposed pistons too much this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
don't like exposed pistons too much this
is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.880> too<00:01:06.420> many<00:01:06.630> exposed<00:01:07.110> pistons<00:01:07.619> for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
is a it's too many exposed pistons for

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.270 
is a it's too many exposed pistons for
me<00:01:08.630> well<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> design<00:01:11.900> basically

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
me well if you like the design basically

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.060 
me well if you like the design basically
six<00:01:14.280> Pistons<00:01:14.760> pushing<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:16.580> shelving<00:01:17.580> unit

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
six Pistons pushing the shelving unit

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.260 
six Pistons pushing the shelving unit
and<00:01:20.070> let's<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.210> five<00:01:21.750> pistons<00:01:22.380> pushing<00:01:23.270> up

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and let's see five pistons pushing up

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.590 
and let's see five pistons pushing up
these<00:01:24.600> full<00:01:25.049> blocks<00:01:26.210> knowing<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.420> are

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
these full blocks knowing that these are

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
these full blocks knowing that these are
full<00:01:27.810> blocks<00:01:28.049> means<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.740> room<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:28.979> not

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
full blocks means that this room is not

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
full blocks means that this room is not
mob<00:01:30.329> proof<00:01:30.689> however<00:01:32.240> you'll<00:01:33.240> notice<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
mob proof however you'll notice in the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
mob proof however you'll notice in the
other<00:01:33.900> room<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.890> pot<00:01:35.130> lights

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
other room there's actually pot lights

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.460 
other room there's actually pot lights
so<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.900> worry<00:01:37.079> about<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so you don't really worry about that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
so you don't really worry about that
alright<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.280> let's<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.640> ahead<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> show<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
alright so let's go ahead and show you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
alright so let's go ahead and show you
what<00:01:39.390> I've<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:40.079> done<00:01:40.500> oh<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:46.590> was

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
what I've actually done oh that was

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
what I've actually done oh that was
super<00:01:47.130> fail<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.640> am<00:01:48.390> stuck

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.280 

i<00:01:51.860> guess<00:01:52.860> i'll<00:01:53.040> post<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.549> video<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.330> figure<00:01:55.260> out

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
i guess i'll post a video and figure out

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.510 
i guess i'll post a video and figure out
how<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.830> here<00:02:00.830> okay<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.369> were

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
how to get out of here okay and we were

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.270 
how to get out of here okay and we were
back<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:04.790> bug<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.820> new<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:08.009> first

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
back that bug is new to me the first

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.120 
back that bug is new to me the first
time<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.610> happened<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:10.440> rights<00:02:10.649> turn<00:02:11.009> on

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
time it's happened all rights turn on

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.530 
time it's happened all rights turn on
the<00:02:11.250> lights<00:02:11.459> should<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.420> been<00:02:12.480> more

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the lights should have been more

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
the lights should have been more
prepared<00:02:12.870> than<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.600> let's<00:02:15.959> get<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.319> our

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
prepared than this and let's get in our

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.340 
prepared than this and let's get in our
staircase<00:02:20.120> okay<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.180> here's<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.810> change<00:02:22.140> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
staircase okay so here's the change of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.910 
staircase okay so here's the change of
design<00:02:22.739> up<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> tables<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.920> little

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
design up at the tables on the little

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.509 
design up at the tables on the little
pockets<00:02:26.340> back<00:02:26.519> here<00:02:27.050> these<00:02:28.050> are<00:02:28.320> just

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
pockets back here these are just

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.130 
pockets back here these are just
trapdoors<00:02:29.519> if<00:02:30.360> you're<00:02:30.510> not<00:02:30.600> familiar<00:02:30.660> with

trapdoors if you're not familiar with

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.620 
trapdoors if you're not familiar with
the<00:02:31.320> texture<00:02:31.920> pack<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.370> these<00:02:32.730> are<00:02:33.030> chests

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the texture pack and these are chests

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.660 
the texture pack and these are chests
down<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:35.250> trap<00:02:35.580> doors<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.970> top<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.330> them

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
down here with trap doors on top of them

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
down here with trap doors on top of them
fairly<00:02:38.670> simple<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.840> what<00:02:40.050> you're<00:02:40.170> thinking

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
fairly simple not what you're thinking

well where's the worth the beds well I
was<00:02:45.300> inspired<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.340> what<00:02:47.580> came<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
was inspired and this is what came of it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.559 
was inspired and this is what came of it
the<00:02:50.880> actual<00:02:51.450> bed<00:02:51.690> room<00:02:52.790> it's<00:02:53.790> got<00:02:53.940> two<00:02:54.150> beds<00:02:54.390> in

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
the actual bed room it's got two beds in

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.870 
the actual bed room it's got two beds in
here<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:56.070> know<00:02:56.100> because<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.400> never<00:02:56.579> really

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
here you know because you never really

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.390 
here you know because you never really
want<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.120> sleep<00:02:57.630> next<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.930> your<00:02:58.079> wife<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.340> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
want to sleep next to your wife and I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
want to sleep next to your wife and I
would<00:02:59.579> want<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.850> right<00:03:00.470> okay<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.150> yeah<00:03:03.150> this

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
would want that right okay so yeah this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.060 
would want that right okay so yeah this
I<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> design<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:05.010> lot<00:03:05.579> as<00:03:05.850> well<00:03:07.070> of

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
I like the design a lot as well of

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.330 
I like the design a lot as well of
course<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.910> like<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.980> many<00:03:11.190> different

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
course you can do like so many different

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
course you can do like so many different
kinds<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.760> designs<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:12.450> little<00:03:12.630> room

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
kinds of designs with this little room

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.750 
kinds of designs with this little room
like<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:15.079> yeah<00:03:16.079> there<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:17.160> same

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
like this but yeah there it is a same

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.789 
like this but yeah there it is a same
thing<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.299> son<00:03:20.870> no<00:03:21.870> difference<00:03:22.260> that

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
thing on this son no difference that

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.960 
thing on this son no difference that
torch<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.459> there<00:03:24.350> if<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:26.549> step<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.880> this

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
torch it up in there if I step on this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.440 
torch it up in there if I step on this
pressure<00:03:27.269> plate<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:28.019> see<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.769> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
pressure plate you can see that the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.800 
pressure plate you can see that the
piston<00:03:30.450> oh<00:03:30.630> there<00:03:30.900> we<00:03:30.989> go<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.950> there<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.750> can

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
piston oh there we go and there you can

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.560 
piston oh there we go and there you can
see<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.230> Pistons<00:03:34.769> pulling<00:03:35.549> those<00:03:35.790> blocks

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
see the Pistons pulling those blocks

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.280 
see the Pistons pulling those blocks
back<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.200> also<00:03:38.750> concealed<00:03:39.750> some<00:03:39.989> wiring

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
back and I also concealed some wiring

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.060 
back and I also concealed some wiring
here<00:03:41.810> that's<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.959> half<00:03:43.170> step<00:03:43.500> down<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:43.950> to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
here that's a half step down there to

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.970 
here that's a half step down there to
cover<00:03:44.250> up<00:03:44.489> some<00:03:44.730> wiring<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:47.390> block

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
cover up some wiring if you have a block

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.970 
cover up some wiring if you have a block
like<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.690> you're<00:03:51.690> trying<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.019> go<00:03:52.230> you're

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
like so and you're trying to go you're

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.789 
like so and you're trying to go you're
trying<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.430> power<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.769> something<00:03:55.769> like

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
trying to get power up something like

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.370 
trying to get power up something like
this<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.459> get<00:03:56.850> my

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
this I get my

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.970 
this I get my
torch<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:59.720> want<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.960> conceal<00:04:00.500> this

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
torch and you want to conceal this

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.370 
torch and you want to conceal this
wiring<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.910> could<00:04:02.120> easily<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.720> doesn't<00:04:03.260> look

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
wiring you could easily a doesn't look

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.320 
wiring you could easily a doesn't look
like<00:04:03.560> Aereo<00:04:05.020> you<00:04:06.020> could<00:04:06.170> easily<00:04:06.380> put<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:07.330> half

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
like Aereo you could easily put a half

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.270 
like Aereo you could easily put a half
step<00:04:08.630> right<00:04:09.170> there<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.860> power<00:04:10.100> will

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
step right there and the power will

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.090 
step right there and the power will
still<00:04:10.550> travel<00:04:11.060> up<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.930> block<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.500> can

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
still travel up the block and you can

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.890 
still travel up the block and you can
cover<00:04:13.310> up<00:04:13.400> partial<00:04:14.150> wine<00:04:14.300> but<00:04:14.480> if<00:04:14.600> you<00:04:14.720> were<00:04:14.870> to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
cover up partial wine but if you were to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.199 
cover up partial wine but if you were to
put<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> second<00:04:15.800> half<00:04:15.980> step<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.550> will<00:04:16.880> cut<00:04:17.120> it

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
put a second half step it will cut it

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.740 
put a second half step it will cut it
off<00:04:17.360> because<00:04:17.510> it'll<00:04:17.810> count<00:04:18.320> as<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.560> full<00:04:18.830> block

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.140 

all<00:04:23.750> right<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:25.160> do<00:04:25.310> not<00:04:25.460> like<00:04:25.790> these

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
all right if you do not like these

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.280 
all right if you do not like these
Pistons<00:04:28.810> like<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.020> look<00:04:30.230> of<00:04:30.350> them<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:31.240> actually

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
Pistons like the look of them I actually

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.420 
Pistons like the look of them I actually
had<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.650> setup<00:04:34.220> where<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:35.950> see<00:04:36.950> if<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:37.100> put<00:04:37.280> that

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
had a setup where I see if I put that

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.970 
had a setup where I see if I put that
there<00:04:37.670> then<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.540> one<00:04:38.780> should<00:04:39.410> grow<00:04:39.710> into<00:04:39.950> a

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
there then this one should grow into a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.040 
there then this one should grow into a
big<00:04:40.160> one<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.580> I'm<00:04:41.150> going<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.330> break<00:04:41.510> things<00:04:41.750> I

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
big one and I'm going to break things I

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
big one and I'm going to break things I
knew<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.640> hi<00:04:43.640> I'll<00:04:43.910> be<00:04:44.090> right<00:04:44.120> back<00:04:44.480> with

knew it hi I'll be right back with

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.750 
knew it hi I'll be right back with
pictures<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.280> there<00:04:49.900> alright<00:04:50.900> guys<00:04:51.080> i'm<00:04:51.350> back

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
paintings covering the Pistons I know

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.100 
paintings covering the Pistons I know
these<00:05:02.270> paintings<00:05:02.540> aren't<00:05:02.840> all<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:02.960> great

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
as you can see when we open them up and

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
nice however you know these I I would

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.700 
nice however you know these I I would
prefer<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.420> Pistons<00:05:21.400> over<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:23.390> look<00:05:23.710> that's

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
prefer the Pistons over that look that's
