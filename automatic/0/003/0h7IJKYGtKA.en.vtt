00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
different change in Nigeria I think

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.100

there's<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.180> mindset<00:01:03.449> changes<00:01:03.930> well

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
there's a bit of a mindset changes well

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.340 
there's a bit of a mindset changes well
