00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.110
 at 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.259
 by association 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.440
 so it takes money by those territories julie and melissa the army 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.439
 Libyan people no longer look for people in uniform 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.240
 because she reported Tuesday night on mag tour 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.199
 always at the forefront of the attacked security rather tell me that there was 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.780
 other blank resignations 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.870
 yes but also to art and the 407 for their part a comeback is this 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.910
 really happy to have signed a partnership to build account 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.109
 then to talk about the departmental association of pensioners of the 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.630
 riders of the nature of the eastern pyrenees 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.360
 with his national president having on the other hand evening 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.220
 she resorts to a little bit of this historical technical association so 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 that the current situation is frozen 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.490
 we are often asked the question - who are rangers to view this way 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.699
 and we hear about it too 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.160
 however the texas media is tidying up like this 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.330
 in fact in the ranks subjectively existed since the 18th century 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.380
 so we were based in the usa and canada 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.290
 and percent of Texans rank on systems from 18 175 to 1 10 935 so 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.720
 it does not exist anymore 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.660
 they go to what exists in the usa these are units 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.480
 military 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 and one of the park wardens the 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.260
 then percent in canada the rangers still lingers the great north canadian 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.540
 and especially with the Inuit 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.630
 % of europe is what especially in an associative framework that we find 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.860
 note that in France this federation 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.970
 associations 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.020
 who pumped so always always the same thing the protection 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.720
 environment 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.990
 the riders to ride 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 italy just a little anecdote is that in italian they have 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730
 a state accreditation 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.460
 so that means they are police powers 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.550
 It is true that in France we will wear 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.990
 we seem like volunteers here you go 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.639
 on time in the department the sexist rangers since 1998 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.940
 but for 100 euros of budget taken the head of research in 2040 energizing 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 if you want a little this spirit of environmental protection 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.900
 percent an hour 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.910
 firstly, we were often asked 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.619
 municipalities to make security 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.419
 - security - in fact 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.549
 for securing for for yard sales and the orientation of 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.999
 vehicles and seven weapons 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.169
 and then so water at the environmental level and well to be on the 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.889
 ground since rangers are men of ground 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.019
 we are on the ground we observe everything that happens 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.079
 and we advise people by quoting 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.189
 because the rangers are so hard 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 it's the million 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.639
 more in three games but also human beings what are we here 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.099
 to inform people we are going 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.089
 to be present inform them and guide the rescuers sometimes 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.459
 he ensured a revolution in the minds of people respect 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.999
 more nature 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.159
 finally the busy was fully agree with you it's true that there is 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.209
 an evolution people respect more but I would say that the problematic 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.659
 it's lack of knowledge is part of it 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.709
 plus the other dragons know it during the 20th century so people have lost 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.859
 the concept halde ruralité 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.239
 and so only when they come back for nature 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.360
 in it are not always aware of the acts and consequences of the acts that 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.569
 can 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.819
 but as it takes 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.119
 hence the interest in finding 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.430
 mandate for failing to have people killed to inform them 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.430
 laughter when we see how to find ourselves as for example 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.210
 I search for particular sites but then in the vallespir 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.279
 it is suddenly found very often in my mind 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.379
 after a little bit we can assume that boulevard clemenceau 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.899
 I went to the wall 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.549
 I remember that one day replace being unconscious perpignan but we 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.749
 will not start marking again 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:44.379
 in the béarn bush 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.179
 maybe yes it's true 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:50.579
 here in the bus I wanted vallespir yes it is not to answer arsene 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.060
 wenger 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.060
 no no no not only possible but it is to leave a beautiful region 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 4 the most pleasant side of this department 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.769
 so much to say that I think of the grandiose scene with the chain should 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.689
 lift of tourism department 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.909
 top 10 it's okay 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.879
 since he is dead how much today inconvenience to the starting line 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.769
 tricolor in the department 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.069
 we are at the ump 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.499
 we know little 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.069
 in other departments in France especially in the last 50 years in 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.829
 average in France we are 500 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.740
 in italy the fourth of his group canada 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.919
 we can almost August 9 and educational 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.460
 and under conditions must be major have been able to start again a year at 11 32 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.900
 best so from the age of 15 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.439
 with parental permission crp 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.999
 and then 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.189
 so for young people and a world readiness internship 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:42.990
 six months ago 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.990
 going back up to 2 8 tons a month 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.240
 with england 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.879
 different actors 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.949
 in information training instead it's important 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.419
 that the rangers self-control meters long as we advance 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.099
 but you still need a minimum of knowledge 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.219
 a minimum of knowledge to be able to 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.779
 actions in the world environment 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:05.990
 patrick thank you very much 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.539
 thank you I left 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.710
 this is morality she would not follow Germany and the rangers are 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.249
 as for them to the judgment referred madrid 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.159
 good go thank you and not his reading 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.059
 that's the case to say
