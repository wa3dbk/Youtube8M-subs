00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:28.400

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.400

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:40.049

00:01:40.049 --> 00:02:02.210

00:01:43.260 --> 00:02:07.910

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:26.690

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.920
 Wireless sd card through wi-fi 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.540
 distributes this design once I want 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.540
 look at the chinese camera 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.730
 okay then I looked 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.780
 say twist spin all blood I 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.970
 lost simplicity 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.200
 speech I don't know what to say i would never 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.450
 in life so much 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.920
 I did not do house surveys because everything 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.810
 it's worth I don't even know how much that is all 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
 worth the help gives the price was not interested 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.150
 it is interesting to me to review on 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.819
 it will suddenly trample 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.630
 she did you hear yes what can i order 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.370
 principle yourself any goods go to diex 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.810
 drown say this if they have 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.670
 in a warehouse somewhere here is a huge warehouse 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.920
 they promised to show me later 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.569
 will bring and I will do this review and if 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.580
 suddenly I have so much more trample me 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:27.069
 I will not know what to do 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.750
 reviews then send your comments well 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.959
 somehow try to read them 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.280
 maybe some interesting idea 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.620
 review you take well here's the first thing 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.090
 I need to take this probably a microphone 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.489
 because this microphone you heard 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.980
 Describe terribly as soon as you hear the new 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.680
 the viciousness of audix has thrown out a new microphone 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.730
 I think they will not give him 3 penny 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.159
 price 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.620
 started getting started don't even know why 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.860
 start probably the easiest or 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.650
 vice versa of the most tricked here is jaya 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.209
 by the way everything is there jui tui dj and 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.920
 so this is all a misreading 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.260
 I will try to find out correctly and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.360
 read gia i correctly so 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.680
 I understand this advanced version because 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.680
 written 32 plus 2 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:17.030
 all such promo video is over i went 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.170
 work this is happiness just what 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.870
 violin 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.870
 work is the same for now
