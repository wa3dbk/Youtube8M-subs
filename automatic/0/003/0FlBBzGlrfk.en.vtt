00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.760
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 stefans bilderwelt last time we have 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 us a bit the tripods 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 looked at the different this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 there and yes I had you off 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.900
 I promised you a few 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.910
 Tricks shows how to use the statues like that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.660
 can handle or what you can do with it all 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.369
 can do 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 There are already a few videos too 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.640
 on youtube I just have it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.590
 a bit of everything packed together 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 I've found so or what I 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.469
 for good and dia can see and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.480
 I hope you like it and as always 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.960
 if you like thumb after 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 above 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.219
 subscribe to the whole and of course with 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.480
 share with your friends 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.430
 thank you and chris okay you as 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 First, I'll show you what to do with the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.600
 furniture then can do 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 you just put it on the tripod 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 Feet that looks big enough 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.439
 are 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.180
 I have different ones here 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.510
 he already tries out the underground himself 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.310
 on his sport math when going forward 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 pushes then it jerky but backwards 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.220
 worked perfectly and you get 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.939
 he has a nice sliding effects fans 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.939
 do what it looks like 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.690
 So you already see the focus though 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 with the mirror reflex movie before 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.010
 set and slowly withdraw 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.440
 I have that underground 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.700
 changed that is the solution carpet 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.170
 ikea is relatively unique so right 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.830
 smooth principle a bit scratched 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.080
 material and of course these glide 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.550
 furniture dresses perfectly on it and now 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.480
 Let's just do this timed train 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.010
 works fine and that 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.780
 works even perhaps in 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.420
 the other direction also looks us 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 that you just a little bit the whole thing 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.220
 practice let's see how we possible 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.890
 Smoothly, this just works out 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.110
 even movement 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.810
 the next one is just a tilt of the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.490
 whole tripod is important 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.440
 Of course, take away the new companions 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.420
 so that the tripod does not slip away 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.890
 and then just here in one too 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 steady movement the camera off in 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.540
 the case also the focus a few 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.000
 set fire then have peasants 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.080
 gold and indicated 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.100
 from rows too 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.510
 and thus has a nice even effect 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.720
 ok next, there is the famous 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.430
 trick with the rubber band yes here simply 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.770
 Take two elastics and do it 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.500
 prevents this jerky start 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.000
 if you pull on the tripod arm naturally 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.080
 it works with zones here 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.950
 Liquid mounted tripod perfect 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.920
 or do you ever it may well 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.850
 Of course, pull in both of course 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.130
 here, too 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.640
 practice that it is just nice and smooth 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.400
 works okay we have one here 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.870
 we still have that in the case 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.150
 at the bilora of the liquid 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.090
 stored tripod and when I do that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.760
 override then it goes in principle 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.320
 back to his original position 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.540
 the beautiful thing about it is an insane one 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.970
 steady movement the something 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.550
 starts faster and then slowly 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.970
 decays and finally, of course, in 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.700
 the picture ends what you see 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.190
 So go quickly gets even 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.870
 slowly and when I use the tripod 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.940
 then adjust accordingly in height 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.459
 I can fix relatively well where 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.440
 this endpoint should be 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.450
 because of course in the total lose 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.170
 okay then we have the cool man here 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.440
 Tripod with the middle arm of the middle arm 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.870
 is quite good in it and is pretty tight 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.550
 and thus I can also be a lower 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.490
 Simulate as easy the screw 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.080
 would have to be almost completely open and 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.510
 then with the hand 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.890
 Attended against weight 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.410
 so I have a nice little one 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.590
 effect so now I have the whole thing 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.019
 Rebuilt I have the camera up 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.489
 tilted and got her with the middle arm 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.880
 balanced and now it works 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.800
 whole as all dolly stabilizer so 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.350
 I can really do it all out 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.380
 maybe that does not quite adjust that 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.580
 perfect but a cheap and like me 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.940
 find quite a solution 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.180
 Well then have fun trying it out and 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.180
 bye
