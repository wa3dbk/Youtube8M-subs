a couple of things that I wanted to
point<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.530> black<00:01:10.860> tube<00:01:11.159> needs

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
point out to you this black tube needs

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.560 
point out to you this black tube needs
to<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:12.380> over<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.040> lead<00:01:14.820> from<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> switch<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to go over the lead from the switch that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.649 
to go over the lead from the switch that
goes<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> output<00:01:16.530> jack<00:01:17.420> there's<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
goes to the output jack there's your

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.280 
goes to the output jack there's your
jack<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.040> runs<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
jack and that runs right to it the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
jack and that runs right to it the
reason<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.950> tubing<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> keep<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
reason for that tubing is to keep the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
reason for that tubing is to keep the
braided<00:01:24.689> wire<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.170> shorting<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.680> against

any of the hot lugs you're going to have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
any of the hot lugs you're going to have
troubles<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:32.159> why<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:32.939> so

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.560 

what<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.440> do<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.120> solder

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
what I like to do is I like to solder

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.050 
what I like to do is I like to solder
off<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> side<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.280> vintage<00:02:13.490> braided

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
off to the side of the vintage braided

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.870 
off to the side of the vintage braided
wire<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.510> I'll<00:02:15.380> tell<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.710> why<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.160> if

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
wire and I'll tell you why because if

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.780 
wire and I'll tell you why because if
you<00:02:17.060> solder<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.690> top<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:19.160> press<00:02:19.520> down

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
you solder on top and you press down

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.600 
you solder on top and you press down
tight<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.900> solder<00:02:21.350> can<00:02:21.680> bleed<00:02:21.980> through<00:02:22.370> and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
tight that solder can bleed through and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.480 
tight that solder can bleed through and
it<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.210> go<00:02:23.360> into<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.110> hot<00:02:24.770> log<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.370> it's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
it can go into that hot log and it's

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.420 
it can go into that hot log and it's
going<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.730> cause<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> short<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.290> solder<00:02:27.860> off

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to cause a short so I solder off

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.620 
going to cause a short so I solder off
to<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> side

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
to the side

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.690 
to the side
still<00:02:30.380> grounds<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.040> back<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.490> pot

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
still grounds it to the back of the pot

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.260 
still grounds it to the back of the pot
but<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.740> don't<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:35.090> that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
but you you know you don't have that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.090 
but you you know you don't have that
problem<00:02:35.570> where<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.320> have<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.620> worry<00:02:36.800> about<00:02:36.860> it

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
problem where you have to worry about it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.160 
problem where you have to worry about it
melting<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.630> should<00:02:38.690> be<00:02:38.960> able<00:02:39.050> to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
melting in and you should be able to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.440 
melting in and you should be able to
these<00:02:39.320> leads<00:02:39.680> should<00:02:40.459> be<00:02:40.610> able<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.880> slide<00:02:41.180> in

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
these leads should be able to slide in

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.840 
these leads should be able to slide in
and<00:02:41.720> out<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.709> vintage<00:02:42.950> braid<00:02:43.430> if<00:02:43.700> you've

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
and out of this vintage braid if you've

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.210 
and out of this vintage braid if you've
got<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.209> pinched<00:02:44.570> down<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.709> wire<00:02:45.950> won't

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
got it pinched down and that wire won't

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.890 
got it pinched down and that wire won't
move<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.640> little<00:02:46.790> bit<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.450> probably<00:02:47.720> have

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
move a little bit then you probably have

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.949 
move a little bit then you probably have
a<00:02:48.020> potential<00:02:48.650> problem<00:02:48.800> there<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.900> is

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
a potential problem there so this is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.780 
a potential problem there so this is
just<00:02:51.320> for<00:02:51.560> all<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.830> do<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.070> yourselfers<00:02:52.610> out

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
just for all you do it yourselfers out

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.660 
just for all you do it yourselfers out
there<00:02:53.060> or<00:02:53.240> your<00:02:53.780> guitar<00:02:54.110> Tech's<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.709> lot<00:02:55.550> of
