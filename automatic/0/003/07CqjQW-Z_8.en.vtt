00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
off on most cases some actually have a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
off on most cases some actually have a
threaded<00:00:51.239> part<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.379> got

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
threaded part in here and you just got

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
threaded part in here and you just got
to<00:00:52.559> turn<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:53.969> case<00:00:54.210> it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to turn them off but in this case it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.830 
to turn them off but in this case it's
just<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.960> set<00:00:55.770> screw<00:00:56.010> underneath<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.719> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
just a set screw underneath so then we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.250 
just a set screw underneath so then we
could<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.640> take<00:00:59.640> some<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.600> some<00:01:00.750> household
