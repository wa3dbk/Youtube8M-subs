00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
so let's start with the first one so one

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.240 
so let's start with the first one so one
of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:42.260> biggest<00:00:43.260> things<00:00:43.470> that<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.830> see<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
of the the biggest things that I see in

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
of the the biggest things that I see in
photographs<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.970> I'm<00:00:45.150> guilty<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> too<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
photographs and I'm guilty of it too is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.980 
photographs and I'm guilty of it too is
that<00:00:47.030> we<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.360> caught<00:00:48.540> up<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> moment

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
that we get so caught up in the moment

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.390 
that we get so caught up in the moment
and<00:00:49.320> especially<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:49.920> photographing

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
and especially when we're photographing

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.210 
and especially when we're photographing
people<00:00:50.430> we're<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:53.070> want

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
people we're like it's you know we want

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.830 
people we're like it's you know we want
their<00:00:53.340> expression<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.030> forget<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
their expression and then we forget to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.660 
their expression and then we forget to
look<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.230> what's<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.860> behind<00:00:56.310> them<00:00:56.640> right

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
look at what's right behind them right

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420 
look at what's right behind them right
so<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.900> it's<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:59.100> pretty

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so right now it's probably really pretty

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
so right now it's probably really pretty
like<00:00:59.670> there's<00:00:59.880> you<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.180> mountains<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
like there's you see mountains and it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.120 
like there's you see mountains and it's
light<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:01.470> it's<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.710> gorgeous

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
light and it's so gorgeous

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.800 
light and it's so gorgeous

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
you step one foot to the right like

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.860 
you step one foot to the right like
maybe<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.670> mean<00:01:40.970> maybe<00:01:41.120> this<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.390> three<00:01:41.600> feet<00:01:41.750> to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
maybe I mean maybe this is three feet to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.000 
maybe I mean maybe this is three feet to
the<00:01:41.960> right<00:01:42.050> but<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.560> very<00:01:42.770> small

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
the right but it's a very small

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.770 
the right but it's a very small
adjustment<00:01:43.520> but<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:44.390> we're<00:01:44.510> going<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.660> show

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
adjustment but now we're going to show

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.970 
adjustment but now we're going to show
you<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.960> photo<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.260> what<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.470> looks<00:01:45.620> like<00:01:45.740> just

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
you the photo of what it looks like just

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.770 
you the photo of what it looks like just
if<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.700> pay<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.030> little<00:01:47.120> attention<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
if we just pay a little attention to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.410 
if we just pay a little attention to
what's<00:01:48.380> going<00:01:48.470> on<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.490> here's<00:01:50.090> what<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.270> looks

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
what's going on so here's what it looks

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.310 
what's going on so here's what it looks
like<00:01:50.510> if<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:50.690> just<00:01:50.869> move<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.110> like<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.229> little

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
like if we just move it like a little

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.789 
like if we just move it like a little
bit<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.619> right

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.800 

so<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.729> second<00:01:58.000> one<00:01:58.119> looks<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.420> much<00:01:58.600> better

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
so the second one looks so much better

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.060 
so the second one looks so much better
and<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.380> just<00:01:59.439> cleaner<00:01:59.710> it<00:01:59.829> looks<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.039> a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and it's just cleaner it looks like a

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.709 
and it's just cleaner it looks like a
painting<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.609> think<00:02:00.670> so

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
painting I think so

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.569 
painting I think so
the<00:02:01.960> tip<00:02:02.469> is<00:02:02.679> just<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:03.070> really<00:02:03.340> pay<00:02:03.549> attention

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
the tip is just to really pay attention

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.399 
the tip is just to really pay attention
to<00:02:03.909> what<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.240> coming<00:02:04.450> out<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.869> back<00:02:05.140> of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
to what is coming out of the back of

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.679 
to what is coming out of the back of
your<00:02:05.829> subjects<00:02:06.280> head<00:02:06.549> or<00:02:06.789> in<00:02:06.909> between<00:02:07.030> them<00:02:07.479> or

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
your subjects head or in between them or

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.600 
your subjects head or in between them or
stop<00:02:08.200> signs<00:02:08.500> or<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.769> worst<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.190> know<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.459> do<00:02:09.519> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
stop signs or the worst you know I do a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.100 
stop signs or the worst you know I do a
lot<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.789> like<00:02:10.119> fashion<00:02:10.539> street<00:02:10.780> style<00:02:10.899> stuff

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
lot of like fashion street style stuff

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.720 
lot of like fashion street style stuff
here<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.349> week<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:12.250> lot<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.400> times<00:02:12.610> I'm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
here in the week and a lot of times I'm

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.130 
here in the week and a lot of times I'm
like<00:02:12.760> oh<00:02:12.940> great<00:02:13.239> photo<00:02:13.510> but<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:13.930> there's<00:02:14.080> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
like oh great photo but then there's a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.720 
like oh great photo but then there's a
stop<00:02:14.319> sign<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.560> totally<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.640> hood

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
stop sign like totally out of the hood

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.130 
stop sign like totally out of the hood
so<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.330> watch<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.569> because<00:02:17.080> I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
so just really watch that because I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.180 
so just really watch that because I
think<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.349> makes<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.590> huge<00:02:17.620> difference<00:02:18.069> it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
think it makes a huge difference it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.130 
think it makes a huge difference it
takes<00:02:18.340> your<00:02:18.459> photos<00:02:18.700> from<00:02:18.849> good<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.150> great<00:02:19.299> the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
takes your photos from good to great the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.270 
takes your photos from good to great the
second<00:02:20.410> thing<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.590> want<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.769> talk<00:02:20.830> about<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
second thing I want to talk about is the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.630 
second thing I want to talk about is the
rule<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.459> thirds<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.920> basically<00:02:23.920> what<00:02:24.519> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
rule of thirds so basically what the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.220 
rule of thirds so basically what the
rule<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.879> thirds<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.569> just<00:02:25.780> making<00:02:26.049> sure

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
rule of thirds is is just making sure

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.759 
rule of thirds is is just making sure
that<00:02:26.860> when<00:02:27.730> you're<00:02:28.000> photographing<00:02:28.769> something

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
that when you're photographing something

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.100 
that when you're photographing something
that<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.370> subject<00:02:30.790> isn't<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.480> right<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that the subject isn't like right in the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.890 
that the subject isn't like right in the
middle<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:33.459> feels<00:02:33.849> better<00:02:34.000> for

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
middle it just feels better for

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.650 
middle it just feels better for
whoever's<00:02:35.230> looking<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.739> photo<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.880> your

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
whoever's looking at the photo for your

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.350 
whoever's looking at the photo for your
focal<00:02:38.140> point<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.560> be<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> little<00:02:39.099> bit

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
focal point to be a little bit

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.839 
focal point to be a little bit
off-center<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.599> there's<00:02:40.989> four<00:02:41.650> places<00:02:42.640> in

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
off-center so there's four places in

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.979 
off-center so there's four places in
your<00:02:43.630> frame<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.430> could<00:02:45.849> focus<00:02:46.329> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
your frame that you could focus that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.660 
your frame that you could focus that
it's<00:02:47.140> going<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.319> just<00:02:47.470> make<00:02:47.620> your<00:02:47.799> picture<00:02:48.640> a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's going to just make your picture a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.150 
it's going to just make your picture a
little<00:02:48.819> bit<00:02:48.910> more<00:02:49.030> interesting<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.160> whether

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
little bit more interesting so whether

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.900 
little bit more interesting so whether
you're<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:52.390> know<00:02:52.480> new<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.900> your<00:02:53.019> DSLR<00:02:53.530> are<00:02:53.910> you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
using the rule of thirds it's going to

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.009 
using the rule of thirds it's going to
just<00:03:04.359> make<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> little<00:03:04.780> bit<00:03:04.930> more

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
for me I choose to use the single focal

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.559 
for me I choose to use the single focal
point<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.450> use<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.380> Canon<00:03:26.769> 5d<00:03:27.069> Mark<00:03:27.400> 3<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:28.239> I

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.089 
to change my focus but for me I always
use<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.780> center<00:03:38.139> focal<00:03:38.440> point<00:03:38.620> number<00:03:38.889> one

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099
