 creativity Anna German yes it is generally 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.930
 unexpectedly because a girlfriend

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.160
 the wall that there needs in Russian

 and she pushed me to this I 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.920
 then looked on the Internet who is 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.460
 Anna Hermann and just at my house then 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.470
 the step bar was my mom who 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.050

 it seemed somehow very touching 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.590
 because I really loved my grandfather 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.530
 my grandfather was also very hard 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.899
 fate and when I read about fate 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.049
 Anna Hermann because it seemed to me 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.040
 somewhere very close very interesting 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.300
 very touching and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.640

 meeting with her husband she and the miracle of filming 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.860
 yes of course it was before filming but it 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.140
 was after all the trials after when 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.700
 I was approved 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.670
 when the first channel approved me on but 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.070
 germo there at what i didn't want

 some such hard questions i just 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.350
 I wanted to see what kind of person it is 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.790
 a man loved anna all his life he was 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.090
 with particular trepidation maybe something i 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.700

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.230
 met 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.209
 some were such stories that here 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.790
 You have directly seen that a person is not easy 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.379

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.450
 speak and here it is valid 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:22.959
 a story that you know whipping I 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.079
 felt great calm and the same 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.159
 time i felt peace in my 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:34.120
 character in me they are very strong 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:38.220
 religious people they are very loving 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.650
 people and in every word even his i 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.139
 feel a big love candy german a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.720
 as for the roots you generally figured out 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.250
 this story as far as I know you 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.630
 embark on filming it when it is already 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.130
 comes questions yes 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.340
 She generally with regard roots she same 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.980
 born in the USSR and in general the story was 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.680
 sad enough when he died first 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.840
 repressed her husband that is father's 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.740
 then younger brother died from scarlet fever and 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.300
 essentially two women she and her mother stayed 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.630
 wander in Russia they were in 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.710
 Novosibirsk in Krasnoyarsk to school she 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.950
 went to jambula 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.459
 you here somehow studied this story from her 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.410
 there is here a book or rather return to 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.120
 Sorrento is a memory like 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.490
 Conclusion prepared this whole story 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.000
 to be very well cooked 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.800
 thank you you know my childhood anna 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.560
 Herman certainly had a very large 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.220
 value then on her on her on her 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.740
 creativity on her relationship to people so 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.880
 what's the fact that she had so much 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.990
 live what was so hard I think 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.360
 this is what created the image 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:55.340
 anna german and of course i'm to this 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.970
 I readied myself a lot and 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.970
 and talked a lot with biographies we 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.510
 Anna Herman's biography and they kind of me 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.389
 it all showed told up 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.970
 story after the accident when played out 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:15.020
 it was also very hard there and even 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.229
 Here doctors forbade like and give birth yes yes 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.000
 but she really wanted to have a baby and 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:24.100
 when she take a new very happy 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.080
 it was of course difficult for her 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.939
 and walk pregnant 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.460
 and give birth and then again she found out what to 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.669
 sorry the words are something wrong with her 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.229
 health again cancer and again the struggle for 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:43.000
 life and for some inner calm 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.080
 she gave birth to a child she loved him very much 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.060
 and knew that now I must leave very 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.520
 happy when i have complicated 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.439
 psychological moments of course difficult 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.240
 magicians moments when i can play 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:06:03.370
 I then completely surrender to the character I and not 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.969
 think about who i am where i am doing and this 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:10.549
 it's all over me afterwards of course 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:14.639
 when i come back after filming not 

00:06:10.549 --> 00:06:17.310
 I have a headache I have not sat down 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.919
 on the set I can do everything and this is very me 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.930
 interesting and certainly nice if there is 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.499
 people are demanding somewhere around there 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.169
 me because yes I sometimes happen 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:31.979
 and you know as a person, but I am not an angel 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:35.099
 not like anna german but were 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.599
 interesting moments for example when here 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.080
 they are german 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.029
 and my leg hurt, I definitely feel that 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.849
 I hurt my leg too, this is somehow strange 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:49.110
 I do not know, or so all the actresses hinder 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:52.069
 no but somehow it passes that thing 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.169
 the important thing is that this film shows 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:58.319
 You know, I would like people to watch 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:02.969
 from the series thought that the most important thing 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:06.419
 in life so they do not spend any 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:09.089
 other things and that the career was the same 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.550
 important as that of Anna German family 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:16.669
 it has always been in the first place family and 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:19.229
 people close it is very difficult together 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.240
 combine somehow because she was 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:26.610
 very big star 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:29.960
 she was also very humble and good 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.380
 mother and woman and wife so 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:37.640
 please think about it and 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:41.540
 find yourself so calm and real 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.340
 some truth and harmony in life and he 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.050
 we wanted to say thank you for the fact that 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.110
 you yourself have not talked like you 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.600
 congratulate and if you allow 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:55.430
 congratulate you too soon 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.230
 become a mom and wish you up to you 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.140
 also 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:04.340
 combined and it is hard but it 

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.530
 maybe and you already know who is not yet 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.380

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.870
 one son already so it will be 2 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.700
 baby on yourself 

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:16.190
