00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
mistake is in thinking that they need a

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.029 
mistake is in thinking that they need a
lot<00:01:37.689> of<00:01:37.749> heat<00:01:38.079> because<00:01:38.319> they<00:01:38.649> grow<00:01:38.829> in<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
lot of heat because they grow in the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.949 
lot of heat because they grow in the
tropics<00:01:39.429> they<00:01:39.670> actually<00:01:40.450> will<00:01:40.630> do<00:01:40.779> better

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
tropics they actually will do better

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.919 
tropics they actually will do better
last<00:01:41.770> longer<00:01:42.189> in<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.670> semi<00:01:42.999> cool<00:01:43.299> environment

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
last longer in a semi cool environment

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.679 
last longer in a semi cool environment
so<00:01:44.020> just<00:01:44.229> below<00:01:44.499> room<00:01:44.709> temperature<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:46.149> ideal

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
so just below room temperature is ideal

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.019 
so just below room temperature is ideal
and<00:01:47.020> very<00:01:47.799> steady<00:01:48.279> temperature<00:01:48.759> as<00:01:48.880> well

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:49.029 
and very steady temperature as well

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.669 
and very steady temperature as well
don't<00:01:49.240> put<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.539> in<00:01:49.569> your<00:01:49.719> radiator<00:01:50.139> if<00:01:50.499> you're

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
don't put it in your radiator if you're

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.190 
don't put it in your radiator if you're
in<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.859> heating<00:01:51.189> climate<00:01:51.719> don't<00:01:52.719> put<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.929> near<00:01:53.109> a

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
in a heating climate don't put it near a

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.099 
in a heating climate don't put it near a
drafty<00:01:54.009> air<00:01:54.279> conditioner<00:01:55.119> something<00:01:55.990> like

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
drafty air conditioner something like

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.109 
drafty air conditioner something like
that<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:56.560> keep<00:01:56.740> your<00:01:56.919> temperature<00:01:57.490> consistent

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
that so keep your temperature consistent

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.449 
that so keep your temperature consistent
light<00:01:58.840> fairly<00:01:59.349> consistent<00:01:59.829> nice<00:02:00.069> and<00:02:00.279> bright

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
light fairly consistent nice and bright

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.679 
light fairly consistent nice and bright
but<00:02:00.700> not<00:02:00.849> direct<00:02:01.209> and<00:02:02.279> in<00:02:03.279> terms<00:02:03.789> of<00:02:04.090> watering

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
but not direct and in terms of watering

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.080 
but not direct and in terms of watering
you'll<00:02:05.499> find<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:06.069> orchids<00:02:06.459> come<00:02:06.669> in<00:02:06.819> two

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
you'll find that orchids come in two

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.280 
you'll find that orchids come in two
types<00:02:07.359> of<00:02:07.649> potting<00:02:08.649> medium<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.580> first<00:02:09.940> is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
types of potting medium the first is

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.050 
types of potting medium the first is
a<00:02:11.349> type<00:02:12.219> of<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:13.060> moss<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.609> that<00:02:15.609> will<00:02:15.790> hold<00:02:15.939> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
a type of of moss and that will hold the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.149 
a type of of moss and that will hold the
water<00:02:16.180> quite<00:02:16.870> well<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.560> you'll<00:02:17.709> find<00:02:17.859> that<00:02:18.069> you

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
water quite well so you'll find that you

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.459 
water quite well so you'll find that you
don't<00:02:18.370> need<00:02:18.579> to<00:02:18.640> water<00:02:18.939> this<00:02:19.120> orchid<00:02:19.540> as<00:02:19.689> much

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 
don't need to water this orchid as much

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.800 
don't need to water this orchid as much
as<00:02:20.709> one<00:02:21.310> that's<00:02:21.459> potted<00:02:21.909> in<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> other<00:02:22.299> medium

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
as one that's potted in the other medium

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.130 
as one that's potted in the other medium
which<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.829> more<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.909> bark<00:02:25.180> chip<00:02:25.599> material

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
which is more of a bark chip material

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.720 
which is more of a bark chip material
that<00:02:26.349> doesn't<00:02:26.560> hold<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:27.010> water<00:02:27.159> quite<00:02:27.579> as

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that doesn't hold the water quite as

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.420 
that doesn't hold the water quite as
well<00:02:28.000> okay<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:29.170> watering<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:29.829> these<00:02:30.040> two

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
well okay so for watering with these two

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.240 
well okay so for watering with these two
types<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:31.030> potting<00:02:31.930> material<00:02:32.379> you'll<00:02:32.859> find<00:02:33.099> as

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
types of potting material you'll find as

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
types of potting material you'll find as
I<00:02:33.340> said<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> moss<00:02:34.120> needs<00:02:34.390> far<00:02:34.659> less

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
I said that the moss needs far less

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.170 
I said that the moss needs far less
watering<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.709> what<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.640> both<00:02:36.819> cases

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
watering so what you do in both cases

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.740 
watering so what you do in both cases
take<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.170> whole<00:02:38.409> plastic<00:02:39.040> pot<00:02:39.599> ideally<00:02:40.599> keep

completely let it drain don't water the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.240 
completely let it drain don't water the
orchid<00:02:55.810> into<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> pot<00:02:56.500> where<00:02:56.799> you're<00:02:56.950> pouring

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
orchid into a pot where you're pouring

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.649 
orchid into a pot where you're pouring
water<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.639> it's<00:02:57.849> going<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.180> sitting<00:02:58.419> in<00:02:58.599> the

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
water in it's going to be sitting in the

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.539 
water in it's going to be sitting in the
water<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.500> will<00:02:59.620> make<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.889> rot<00:03:00.069> so<00:03:00.370> that's

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
water that will make it rot so that's

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.099 
water that will make it rot so that's
the<00:03:00.700> main<00:03:00.849> thing<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.239> just<00:03:01.450> soaking<00:03:01.659> in<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> sink

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
the main thing is just soaking in a sink

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.110 
the main thing is just soaking in a sink
for<00:03:02.230> about<00:03:02.409> an<00:03:02.560> hour<00:03:02.620> remove<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.700> let<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:03.879> fully

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
for about an hour remove it let it fully

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.839 
for about an hour remove it let it fully
drain<00:03:04.450> either<00:03:05.169> these<00:03:05.470> potting<00:03:06.310> mediums<00:03:06.639> but

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
drain either these potting mediums but

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.610 
drain either these potting mediums but
as<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.060> said<00:03:07.120> you'll<00:03:07.389> need<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.659> do<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> far<00:03:08.349> less

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
as I said you'll need to do it far less

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.009 
as I said you'll need to do it far less
frequently<00:03:08.829> with<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.790> moss<00:03:10.000> material<00:03:10.629> let<00:03:10.930> it

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
frequently with the moss material let it

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.179 
frequently with the moss material let it
dry<00:03:11.200> out<00:03:11.230> just<00:03:11.409> a<00:03:11.739> little<00:03:11.769> bit<00:03:12.069> in<00:03:12.159> between

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
dry out just a little bit in between

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.970 
dry out just a little bit in between
waterings<00:03:12.939> okay<00:03:13.599> so<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.930> last<00:03:13.959> thing<00:03:14.409> I'm

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
waterings okay so the last thing I'm

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.800 
waterings okay so the last thing I'm
going<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.189> talk<00:03:15.310> about<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.729> what<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> do<00:03:16.269> when

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
going to talk about is what to do when

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.399 
going to talk about is what to do when
your<00:03:16.930> orchid<00:03:17.169> has<00:03:17.319> finished<00:03:17.530> blooming<00:03:17.889> and<00:03:19.409> on

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
your orchid has finished blooming and on

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.809 
your orchid has finished blooming and on
the<00:03:20.620> stem<00:03:20.829> you'll<00:03:21.010> see<00:03:21.190> there<00:03:21.489> are<00:03:21.579> these

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
the stem you'll see there are these

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.219 
the stem you'll see there are these
little<00:03:22.000> nodule<00:03:22.479> points<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.019> couple

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
little nodule points that a couple

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.569 
inches apart all the way down the stem
you<00:03:26.019> want<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.560> keep<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.889> fair<00:03:27.190> amount<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.489> the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
you want to keep a fair amount of the

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.210 
you want to keep a fair amount of the
stem<00:03:27.790> intact<00:03:28.329> in<00:03:28.569> fact<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.319> you've<00:03:29.919> got<00:03:30.099> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
stem intact in fact so you've got the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.420 
stem intact in fact so you've got the
blooms<00:03:30.540> where<00:03:31.540> they<00:03:31.659> end<00:03:31.870> go<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.859> couple<00:03:33.190> of

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
blooms where they end go up a couple of

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.119 
blooms where they end go up a couple of
nodules<00:03:33.849> back<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.389> cut<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.139> above<00:03:35.590> one<00:03:36.099> of

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
nodules back and cut it above one of

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.479 
nodules back and cut it above one of
those<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:37.120> reason<00:03:37.419> being<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.889> plant

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
those the reason being that if the plant

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.949 
those the reason being that if the plant
is<00:03:39.609> going<00:03:39.819> to<00:03:39.879> push<00:03:40.000> off<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> new<00:03:40.389> flower<00:03:40.629> spike

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
is going to push off a new flower spike

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.740 
is going to push off a new flower spike
it<00:03:41.139> may<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> at<00:03:41.799> one<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.489> these<00:03:42.790> nodes<00:03:43.120> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it may do it at one of these nodes so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.930 
it may do it at one of these nodes so
you<00:03:43.840> want<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.079> leave<00:03:44.229> a<00:03:44.260> few<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.650> them

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you want to leave a few of them

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.250 
you want to leave a few of them
available<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.269> plant<00:03:46.510> if<00:03:46.750> it's<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.139> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
available for the plant if it's going to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.069 
available for the plant if it's going to
choose<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:48.099> route<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:49.269> other<00:03:49.299> option<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.900> it

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
choose that route the other option is it

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.750 
choose that route the other option is it
will<00:03:50.199> push<00:03:50.379> a<00:03:50.409> new<00:03:50.590> flower<00:03:50.949> spike<00:03:51.280> right<00:03:51.609> out

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
will push a new flower spike right out

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.789 
will push a new flower spike right out
of<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.030> base<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:52.720> as<00:03:52.870> long<00:03:53.109> as<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.440> stem<00:03:53.650> is

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
of the base but as long as the stem is

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.129 
of the base but as long as the stem is
nice<00:03:53.979> and<00:03:54.159> green<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.549> can<00:03:54.699> leave<00:03:54.909> it<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.239> you

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
nice and green you can leave it and you

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.259 
nice and green you can leave it and you
may<00:03:56.290> find<00:03:56.530> within<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.310> few<00:03:57.459> months<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.120> it's

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
may find within a few months that it's

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.089 
may find within a few months that it's
getting<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.599> new<00:03:58.750> chute<00:03:58.989> right<00:03:59.560> off<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.889> stem

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
getting a new chute right off the stem

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.429 
getting a new chute right off the stem
there<00:04:00.340> aside<00:04:01.090> from<00:04:01.299> that<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.659> have<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:01.930> rebloom

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
there aside from that to have it rebloom

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.860 
there aside from that to have it rebloom
and<00:04:02.680> give<00:04:03.669> it<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.819> bit<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.150> winter<00:04:04.419> give<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.720> a

six months of a dormant period

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.209 
six months of a dormant period
good<00:04:24.729> they<00:04:25.449> do<00:04:25.509> bloom<00:04:25.870> about<00:04:26.590> every<00:04:26.979> six
