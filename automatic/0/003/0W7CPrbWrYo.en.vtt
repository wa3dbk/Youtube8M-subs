00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.130
 Speak there personal beauty that we learn 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.080
 here and good or bring more this video 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 as if it were a first sells 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.510
 impressions that in the case let's talk a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 little of what I found from da nova to manÃ© 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 which is next and in fact it is not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 necessarily a mother I would say that it is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 more equipment since it occupies the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 space of an equipment with the doctor 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.680
 kit etc 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.590
 so he does not replace a pistol 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 then a primary, well I think 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.469
 This is a weapon that is for you in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.750
 very specific situations 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.629
 I do not think it's even going to be used much 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.860
 kill since he has a very reload 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 high like this 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 so it gets a little complicated if you make a mistake 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.890
 the shot and then have more enemies and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.729
 I think it will be very useful if 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.909
 you team paul is kambou and it would be the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.689
 scania's arrow is that it gives sport already 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 So this is a weapon you need. 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.590
 very close to killing and by the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.049
 The less good is that if you hit 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 close is sure you will kill more 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.360
 for you to be seen from afar you will have 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.990
 that make up a lot but a lot even already 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.869
 that the velocity of the arrow in the case is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 very slow then it consequently she 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.450
 It will change more 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.659
 so you're going to have to increase either 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.540
 upload but still media me if you 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.689
 hit you will not take 100% damage 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.329
 At least that in the next arrow I do not 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.640
 released yet or exclusive line 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.409
 distance midfield but as I 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.290
 I was talking I think it's going to be more 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.380
 useful if you use the excuse or 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.969
 explosive since you will be able to destroy 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.909
 or help to destroy some 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.180
 almost explosive vehicles and I really 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.489
 I do not think it's worth much to use 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.860
 to kill infantry 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.810
 but it's a really fun way to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.410
 play 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.410
 although his 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 It's frustrating sometimes, but we're going. 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.670
 with which the community behaves or 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.550
 Let's see if anyone will do some 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.410
 monteith get out of crossbow since I think 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.350
 It's going to be hard, right? 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.320
 and these are my impressions is a weapon 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.240
 It's really fun if you play like this and I think 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.460
 which can be quite useful 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.830
 however if you are using the arrow 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.050
 standard that comes in the case in 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.560
 specialized neither explosive nor 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.020
 scandal in London is you will only be able to 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.510
 kill because the distance even and I do not 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.580
 I know if you noticed it but had 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.950
 sometimes I got it right 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.250
 far but did not give enough data to 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 then kill that part definitely 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.400
 well I think it's to use close range is 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.730
 at least with that arrow and the off 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.770
 the map I still do not have access to it 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.210
 I do not know why the date taking so long 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.670
 to cast right 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.850
 but I'll bring game place as soon as 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.430
 possible and how I got close 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.670
 well I joined the server of a gringo who 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.660
 I have contact that is the move and I think 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.850
 you 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.110
 some should know and is a channel 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.510
 very famous gringo until and he has 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.550
 some techniques I do not really know 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.670
 right like it does but you 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.950
 almost enters the server and leaves with 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.930
 crosby web is for you to win next 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.010
 you have to win three games already 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.250
 fiterman 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.720
 so he probably put a map 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.730
 vanilla or the map of turkey escape three 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.459
 normal even this then went through the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.239
 after mef three times and I think you 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.820
 they will not need to do this much anymore 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.060
 that when I release this video I think 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.709
 first jet will come out is and that's it 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.739
 I hope that you guys have 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.739
 liked this video do not forget to 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.560
 evaluate to follow me on twitter 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.560
 and thank you very much until the next
