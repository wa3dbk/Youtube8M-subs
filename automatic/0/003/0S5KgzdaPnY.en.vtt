00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
it does a good job with it let's see if

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.930 
it does a good job with it let's see if
we<00:04:08.019> can't<00:04:08.230> find<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.650> companion<00:04:09.070> photo<00:04:09.579> for

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940

we can't find the companion photo for
this<00:04:10.060> there<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.049> go<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.260> can<00:04:11.500> see<00:04:11.709> the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
this there you go you can see the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.229 
this there you go you can see the
different<00:04:12.190> photos<00:04:12.370> now<00:04:12.610> both<00:04:12.820> these<00:04:13.000> have

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
different photos now both these have

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.330 
different photos now both these have
their<00:04:13.420> brightness<00:04:13.690> is<00:04:13.989> turned<00:04:14.290> off<00:04:14.590> all<00:04:15.010> the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
their brightness is turned off all the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.909 
their brightness is turned off all the
way<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.269> it's<00:04:17.140> really<00:04:17.260> up<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.709> decide

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
close here and then we moved in a little

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.890 
close here and then we moved in a little
bit<00:04:38.259> closer<00:04:38.529> on<00:04:38.800> this<00:04:38.949> next<00:04:39.310> shot<00:04:39.749> in<00:04:40.749> the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
bit closer on this next shot in the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.749 
bit closer on this next shot in the
iPhone<00:04:41.229> 5<00:04:41.409> which<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.650> good<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:41.919> close-up<00:04:42.460> shots

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759

iPhone 5 which is good a close-up shots
but<00:04:43.029> we're<00:04:43.180> really<00:04:43.300> impressed<00:04:43.659> with<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
but we're really impressed with the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.920 
but we're really impressed with the
detail<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.860> came<00:04:45.189> out<00:04:45.370> in<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.819> 10<00:04:46.360> megapixel

here<00:04:57.699> some<00:04:57.939> of<00:04:57.969> the<00:04:58.090> colorization<00:04:58.919> some<00:04:59.919> of

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
here some of the colorization some of

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.740 
here some of the colorization some of
this<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.219> how<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.430> screens<00:05:00.819> also<00:05:01.120> present

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
you you can see some compares here let's

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.619 
you you can see some compares here let's
go<00:05:10.449> ahead<00:05:10.569> and<00:05:11.050> flip<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:12.120> some<00:05:13.120> more<00:05:13.240> photos

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
go ahead and flip to some more photos

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
course now I do love the richness here I

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.420 
course now I do love the richness here I
can<00:05:37.180> see<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.439> there's<00:05:38.589> much<00:05:38.830> better<00:05:39.009> richest

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
can see that there's much better richest

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.059 
can see that there's much better richest
and<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.699> color<00:05:39.969> and<00:05:40.060> pop<00:05:40.719> of<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.229> Moto<00:05:41.949> X

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
and the color and pop of the Moto X

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.490 
and the color and pop of the Moto X
mainly<00:05:42.699> because<00:05:42.879> it's<00:05:43.479> got<00:05:43.839> 60<00:05:44.169> frames<00:05:44.379> per

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
mainly because it's got 60 frames per

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.769 
mainly because it's got 60 frames per
second<00:05:44.889> so<00:05:44.919> it's<00:05:45.129> just<00:05:45.430> getting<00:05:46.360> a<00:05:46.569> lot<00:05:46.750> more

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
second so it's just getting a lot more

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.790

richard juice in its recordings and
everything<00:05:51.129> else<00:05:51.250> but<00:05:51.969> on<00:05:52.180> that<00:05:52.449> I<00:05:52.479> mean<00:05:52.810> it's

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
everything else but on that I mean it's

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.050 
everything else but on that I mean it's
they're<00:05:53.589> both<00:05:53.800> great<00:05:54.099> cameras<00:05:54.580> it's<00:05:54.789> really

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
they're both great cameras it's really

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.999 
they're both great cameras it's really
hard<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.449> tell<00:05:55.659> you<00:05:55.810> which<00:05:56.469> one<00:05:56.680> might<00:05:56.860> be<00:05:56.889> a

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
hard to tell you which one might be a

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.439 
hard to tell you which one might be a
better<00:05:57.189> camera<00:05:57.460> although<00:05:57.729> I<00:05:57.849> do<00:05:57.969> like<00:05:58.270> the

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
better camera although I do like the

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.959 
better camera although I do like the
iPhone<00:05:58.839> 5<00:05:59.110> much<00:05:59.379> better<00:05:59.649> in<00:06:00.159> the<00:06:00.310> images<00:06:00.789> that

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
iPhone 5 much better in the images that

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.610 
iPhone 5 much better in the images that
I'm<00:06:01.060> seeing<00:06:01.389> although<00:06:01.779> I<00:06:01.810> like<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.169> video<00:06:02.319> and

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
I'm seeing although I like the video and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.469 
I'm seeing although I like the video and
the<00:06:02.710> Moto<00:06:02.919> X<00:06:03.159> better<00:06:03.460> that's<00:06:03.879> my<00:06:04.120> personal

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
the Moto X better that's my personal

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.929 
the Moto X better that's my personal
opinion<00:06:04.539> and<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.289> do<00:06:05.349> like<00:06:05.649> how<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.919> Moto<00:06:06.279> X<00:06:06.339> now

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
opinion and I do like how the Moto X now

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.339 
opinion and I do like how the Moto X now
she<00:06:07.000> seems<00:06:07.389> to<00:06:07.479> do<00:06:07.599> a<00:06:07.629> little<00:06:07.750> bit<00:06:07.899> better<00:06:08.020> in

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
she seems to do a little bit better in

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.249 
she seems to do a little bit better in
close-up<00:06:08.949> macro<00:06:09.699> shots<00:06:09.939> so<00:06:10.389> that's<00:06:10.569> what<00:06:11.229> I
