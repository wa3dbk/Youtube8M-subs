00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.380
 I do not say in mourning that as they are 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.349
 be all welcome from a new 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.500
 channel video and well, how can 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.960
 see in the title and above decided to do 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.480
 a tutorial of gta 5 how to get the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.599
 outlets or something like that 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.900
 They are cars that have to 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.029
 use for the big blow 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.300
 they have to jump almost to the end of the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.460
 history 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.559
 and the truth is that it cost me a lot 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.000
 look for these cars because they are sent us 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.660
 a photography 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.180
 lester 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.460
 the one who plans the robberies well if they have not 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.989
 played the story they will not understand me 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.130
 but I have decided to share them with 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 you so they do not give you 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.590
 problems like I did not have them and so 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.790
 good as you can see on the map 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.699
 if they could not see the address well 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.809
 can stop the video and see the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.809
 address of each car 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.460
 or something like that and well, as you can see 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.740
 in the first outlet is in it 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.390
 in the parking lot in this 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.840
 parking that are about like five 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.550
 car parking flats is the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.280
 only car that will find displeasure 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 on the top floor is the only car where 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.650
 will find how you can see the law 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.840
 I gave them my path and well it 's the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 first gameplay and asks me to take it to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.170
 the saints right where you can 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 turning I need to change the suspension 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.150
 of the car because they need to 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.860
 for the theft of the subject not so good is 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.690
 the first car then asks them to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.600
 take to the gale 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.420
 to save the car and after the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.790
 three cars will be able to do the mission 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.680
 good is the first the second as 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.180
 you can see there the second one in this 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.640
 address where I'm going to show you in the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.920
 map the cults where I'm putting the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.920
 point so they can not be lost 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.800
 as you can see there I am in a car 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.000
 common and current 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.600
 as you can see it 's there parked in 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.910
 half of the cars are in the middle 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.390
 of a neighborhood as the message of the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.620
 stress of some shops lined up like 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.409
 who says of the city 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 and well they already take first in this car and 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.700
 I take him likewise have to carry 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.140
 with all three cars have to 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.140
 take the saints slopes 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.370
 and also the last of the garages does not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.410
 it has to be nothing more than the only thing 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.140
 difficult that is to find the quality and 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.440
 the rest is nonsense until after 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.130
 bank and it fascinates me 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.130
 and good 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.040
 I think that to ask them to get 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.670
 the cars have to go in the second 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.370
 option 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.409
 the first is to plan otherwise 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.310
 they chose first option so I do not know 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.000
 well the third car is here 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.099
 it's a middle place weird good he 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.270
 he shows them the map and well that alley 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.390
 and there's the black car can finish 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.100
 it is counted by the colors 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.560
 and the same asks us to take him to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.510
 the jumps are three cars are very 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920
 difficult to defeat because first as 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.840
 it's a new game I do not know very well the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.840
 city ​​and also many of you 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.330
