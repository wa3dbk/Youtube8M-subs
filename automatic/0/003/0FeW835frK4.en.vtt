00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 so when installing a species rivet i 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.930
 faced with a problem what was 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.670
 shown earlier that I did not succeed 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.759
 insert and tighten the screw rivet 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.390
 my gadget what i did i did 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:30.449
 a little refinement now and now 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 I will explain why this data let's say 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.020
 so lover is very effective before 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.420
 that 's my swimsuit 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.860
 only in its original form is now closer 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:52.969
 I will show but with the original form 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.969
 I imagined such a thing 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.270
 a little bit through this part since she 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.450
 especially not need cleaned cherries here and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.450
 what is the biggest thing that we have 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.760
 the internal unit changes when my 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.950
 This part rested and I could not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.939
 to insert 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:23.600
 i'm simple getting myself on was on 88 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.600
 bolt long 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.890
 and I did such a thing with 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:38.450
 groove so you can put 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:46.330
 screw rivet i hope will be seen 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:50.380
 and it was possible to drill side by side 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:54.590
 Of course, we will be professionals and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.460
 make it ok beautiful without heap 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.340
 extra holes 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.290
 then there will be a video how to install 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.040
 directly already with such an upgrade 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.040
 screw rivet
