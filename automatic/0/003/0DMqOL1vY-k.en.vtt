00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
bling bling blaow type case if you know

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.270 
bling bling blaow type case if you know
what<00:05:18.940> I'm<00:05:19.030> saying<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:19.900> just<00:05:20.260> got<00:05:20.440> this<00:05:20.770> one<00:05:21.070> I

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
what I'm saying so I just got this one I

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.090 
what I'm saying so I just got this one I
believe<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.000> prices<00:05:22.270> for<00:05:22.510> these<00:05:22.780> cases<00:05:23.289> range

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
believe the prices for these cases range

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.640 
believe the prices for these cases range
so<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.880> would<00:05:25.270> start<00:05:25.570> at<00:05:25.810> our<00:05:25.960> guests<00:05:26.260> about

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
so it would start at our guests about

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.950 
so it would start at our guests about
fifty<00:05:27.070> nine<00:05:27.190> dollars<00:05:27.669> depending<00:05:28.389> on<00:05:28.630> how<00:05:28.780> much

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
fifty nine dollars depending on how much

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.719 
fifty nine dollars depending on how much
customization<00:05:29.410> you<00:05:29.800> get<00:05:29.950> done<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.550> and

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
customization you get done to it and

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.060 
customization you get done to it and
then<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.539> prices<00:05:31.960> would<00:05:32.080> go<00:05:32.139> up<00:05:32.320> like<00:05:32.800> if<00:05:32.979> you

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
then the prices would go up like if you

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.770 
then the prices would go up like if you
have<00:05:33.190> an<00:05:33.310> iPad<00:05:33.700> I<00:05:33.970> think<00:05:34.210> it's<00:05:34.360> more<00:05:34.450> money

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
have an iPad I think it's more money

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.850 
have an iPad I think it's more money
about<00:05:35.370> 100<00:05:36.370> hours<00:05:36.430> if<00:05:36.849> i'm<00:05:37.000> not<00:05:37.120> mistaken<00:05:37.240> and

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
about 100 hours if i'm not mistaken and

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.830 
about 100 hours if i'm not mistaken and
the<00:05:38.860> phone<00:05:39.130> cases<00:05:39.639> i<00:05:39.760> have<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.030> five<00:05:40.240> so<00:05:40.479> the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
the phone cases i have the five so the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.020 
the phone cases i have the five so the
fire<00:05:41.020> was<00:05:41.200> around<00:05:41.410> fifty<00:05:41.770> nine<00:05:41.889> dollars<00:05:42.310> so

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
fire was around fifty nine dollars so

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.210 
fire was around fifty nine dollars so
the<00:05:43.599> four<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.289> guess<00:05:44.500> through<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.800> cheaper<00:05:45.160> if

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
the four I guess through the cheaper if

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.610 
the four I guess through the cheaper if
you<00:05:45.370> have<00:05:45.490> before<00:05:45.639> and<00:05:46.120> someone<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:47.440> i'll
