 hello again today I bring you turkey 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.099
 baked with honey and lemon special for 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.750
 the end of the year times in many 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.330
 families in guatemala usually eat 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.250
 turkey either at Christmas or in New Year and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 this recipe loves my family well 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 I want to share it with you and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 I hope you like it too we are going to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.140
 start with a half cup of juice 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.910
 lemon we 're going to put everything in one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 blender if you want a few sheets of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.650
 peppermint greg he ensino a cup of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.869
 parsley will be very good about 6 garlic 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 they can be less if they want one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.870
 large onion add 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.719
 olive oil and 2 cups of the honey 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 let's mix to move a little bit to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.180
 that dissolves with the ingredients 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.570
 add 2 tablespoons of bouillon one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.820
 spoonful of pepper we add 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.590
 spoonful and half of oregano 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.090
 we will also add a 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:02.440
 teaspoon of thyme a spoonful of 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.930
 salt and a spoonful of soy sauce all 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.570
 we are going to put this to liquefy 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.940
 look good well well liquefied and when 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.650
 our payment is ready, we have it 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.400
 thawed and we will use the payment 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.020
 thawed remember 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.670
 it needs a lot of time to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.490
 defrost they look with another this 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.850
 little piece of skin but hey it does not matter 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.190
 let's peel off all the skin of the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.050
 part of the breast can be helped with 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.370
 a spatula with the back for 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.320
 that is not going to break the skin 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.310
 this will help us to be able to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.160
 add butter later so that it does not 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.470
 it's so dry and now we're going to 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.110
 put in a bag I bought this bag that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 It's like a huge bag of sandwich 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.580
 let's put everything we liquefy and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.430
 let's leave it marinating for a few 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.800
 four hours or if you leave it overnight 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 earlier it is much better and from time to time 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.780
 when it is good to give a move 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.280
 so we put it in the refrigerator and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.620
 when we are ready to bake 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.440
 we prepare our wood or what 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.720
 let's use it to bake it 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.500
 place and now if the butter is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.900
 who mentioned them we can add 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 oregano parsley and chopped to taste 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.230
 you can do this with 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.180
 any other recipe they go to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.359
 use to bake your turkey 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.310
 It helps that it is not so dry and that it 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.680
 brown better 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.120
 all the bread so we put it by 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.480
 under the skin 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.390
 sorry I have a little bit hard to talk 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.120
 why 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.159
 but we're going to put all the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.099
 butter everywhere we doubled 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.480
 your wings down so you do not 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.989
 burn and to give it more stability 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.129
 our turkey also now we are going to 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.760
 put half of what we use to 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.280
 marinate 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.560
 the rest we will keep in the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.590
 refrigerator since it will serve us for 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.110
 make our sauce at the end so you 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.659
 we tie your legs well if you wish 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.370
 can put aluminum foil so that 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.870
 you will not burn too 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.659
 and in the neck paste some 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.970
 crazy people I just put him 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.430
 some sticks to make it more 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.670
 stretched and that is also legally my 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.040
 Daddy, so when it's ready , 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.690
 let's put to preheat our 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.360
 oven at 475 degrees we cover it 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.760
 and we're going to put it to bake for 20 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.700
 minutes after your twenty minutes 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.800
 we lower the temperature to 275 degrees and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 we let it bake for 20 minutes 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 for every pound the turkey has when 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.570
 two hours before the end of that 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.780
 time we uncover it and we're going to let 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.490
 it is well browned all over my oven 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.740
 it gets too hot in the back 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.090
 so if you control your 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.040
 oven so they are not going to burn 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.860
 only one side has to look good 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.650
 golden brown so you control well 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.300
 that's it so when we're done we're going to 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.340
 let stand for about 30 minutes 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.470
 before serving it and meanwhile we go 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.420
 to make our sauce with what 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.280
 we reserve we are going to add a cup of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.530
 water we are going to put it to boil 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.549
 and let's express it with a little 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.889
 flour dissolved in cold water and now you 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.220
 let's add all the juice that was left 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.830
 below our turkey this is going to 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.760
 give an incredible flavor to this sauce what 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.030
 Season well with salt and pepper to taste 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.360
 we put it in and we're ready to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.080
 can serve it in a simple bed 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.660
 lettuce is super delicious or with 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.090
 that you prefer to accompany him 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.180
 I recommend very much since this 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.160
 it really is very rich so I hope that 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.610
 like it and until next time 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.610
 bye
