cables great look at this on the really

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.820 
cables great look at this on the really
most<00:02:12.750> significant<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.670> new<00:02:15.440> PCI<00:02:16.440> Express

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
most significant is the new PCI Express

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.540 
most significant is the new PCI Express
connectors<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.610> all<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:20.160> has<00:02:20.310> eight

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
connectors is all it has eight

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.790 
connectors is all it has eight
altogether<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.420> these<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.470> them<00:02:22.620> are

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
altogether of these and all of them are

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.150 
altogether of these and all of them are
six<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.239> convert<00:02:24.599> them<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.870> eight<00:02:25.170> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
six and you can convert them to eight so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.250 
six and you can convert them to eight so
you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.580> total<00:02:26.970> about<00:02:27.180> four<00:02:27.569> GPUs

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you can have a total about four GPUs

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.180 
you can have a total about four GPUs
that<00:02:28.500> has<00:02:28.620> 16<00:02:29.550> pin<00:02:29.790> 18<00:02:30.300> pin<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.680> connects

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
that has 16 pin 18 pin and it connects

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.490 
that has 16 pin 18 pin and it connects
to<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:33.019> 12<00:02:34.019> pin<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.370> psu<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.930> looking

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
to a 12 pin to the psu so looking

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.600 
to a 12 pin to the psu so looking
forward<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:40.190> apparently<00:02:41.190> supposed

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
forward to that and apparently supposed

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.390 
forward to that and apparently supposed
to<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.879> new<00:02:42.030> standard<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
to be a new standard so it's going to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.350 
to be a new standard so it's going to
come<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.690> pretty<00:02:46.200> future-proof<00:02:47.360> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
come up so it's pretty future-proof and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.530 
come up so it's pretty future-proof and
put<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> side<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.239> then<00:02:51.239> we<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
put this on the side and then we get to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.680 
put this on the side and then we get to
the<00:02:51.870> actual<00:02:52.670> yes<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.970> oh<00:02:56.000> wow<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.360> really

very nice design so you can see it's
like<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.660> hundred<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.380> forty<00:04:19.010> millimeter<00:04:19.400> fan

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.370 
and I just want you to take a look at
the<00:04:22.820> finish<00:04:23.710> it's<00:04:24.710> almost<00:04:24.860> like<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:26.200> very<00:04:27.200> nice

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
the finish it's almost like a very nice

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.980 
the finish it's almost like a very nice
rough<00:04:27.740> rugged<00:04:28.130> finish<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.990> definitely

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
rough rugged finish and definitely

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.879 
rough rugged finish and definitely
unscratched<00:04:30.770> ball<00:04:31.039> almost<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:32.889> really

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
unscratched ball almost like really

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.820 
unscratched ball almost like really
really<00:04:34.160> smooth<00:04:34.580> sand<00:04:34.880> paper<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:36.650> nice

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
really smooth sand paper and the nice

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.510 
really smooth sand paper and the nice
revolution<00:04:37.580> 85<00:04:38.419> +<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.160> obviously<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.280> will<00:04:40.370> be

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
revolution 85 + and obviously it will be

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.190 
revolution 85 + and obviously it will be
put<00:04:40.729> like<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:42.250> 85<00:04:43.250> +<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.990> as<00:04:44.990> you<00:04:45.050> can<00:04:45.169> see

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
put like this 85 + and as you can see

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.690 
put like this 85 + and as you can see
this<00:04:45.650> uh<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.090> same<00:04:47.590> as<00:04:48.590> a

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
this uh this is the same as a

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.159 
this uh this is the same as a
self-regulating<00:04:49.700> ec<00:04:50.539> you<00:04:50.780> don't<00:04:50.930> that's<00:04:51.020> why

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
self-regulating ec you don't that's why

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.290 
self-regulating ec you don't that's why
I<00:04:51.200> don't<00:04:51.350> have<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.530> converters<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.340> this<00:04:53.150> is

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
I don't have the converters and this is

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.950 
I don't have the converters and this is
the<00:04:54.400> power<00:04:55.400> indicator<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.570> has<00:04:56.690> four

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
the power indicator and it has four

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.010 
the power indicator and it has four
different<00:04:57.080> colors<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:58.760> don't<00:04:59.690> need<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.900> get

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
different colors and I don't need to get

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.260 
different colors and I don't need to get
through<00:05:00.139> with<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.380> but<00:05:00.650> it's<00:05:01.220> very<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.580> very

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.620 
through with you but it's very a very
cool<00:05:02.870> feature<00:05:03.070> tells<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.190> when<00:05:04.310> it's<00:05:04.460> okay

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
cool feature tells you when it's okay

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.950 
cool feature tells you when it's okay
when<00:05:05.630> it's<00:05:05.750> off<00:05:05.930> all<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:08.180> thank<00:05:08.810> it's

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
when it's off all that and to thank it's

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.600 
when it's off all that and to thank it's
very<00:05:08.990> heavy<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.270> it's<00:05:11.270> just<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.539> nice<00:05:11.750> red

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
very heavy and it's just a nice red

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.820 
very heavy and it's just a nice red
finish<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:13.849> side<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.410> wow<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.440> can't<00:05:15.800> wait

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
finish on the side and wow I can't wait

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.969 
finish on the side and wow I can't wait
to<00:05:15.919> try<00:05:16.099> this<00:05:16.160> out<00:05:16.419> that<00:05:17.419> mentions<00:05:17.870> are<00:05:18.880> 86

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:30.229 

eighty<00:05:22.979> six<00:05:24.559> millimeters<00:05:25.610> by<00:05:27.139> 190<00:05:28.189> by<00:05:29.189> 150<00:05:29.849> so

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:30.239 
eighty six millimeters by 190 by 150 so

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.189 
eighty six millimeters by 190 by 150 so
standard<00:05:30.569> a<00:05:30.629> check<00:05:31.189> slightly<00:05:32.189> longer<00:05:33.199> but

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
standard a check slightly longer but

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.350 
standard a check slightly longer but
obviously<00:05:34.679> the<00:05:34.889> enermax<00:05:35.339> galaxy<00:05:35.999> was<00:05:36.119> a<00:05:36.149> lot

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
obviously the enermax galaxy was a lot

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.889 
obviously the enermax galaxy was a lot
bigger<00:05:36.509> but<00:05:36.839> this<00:05:37.139> is<00:05:37.259> more<00:05:37.439> efficient<00:05:37.949> and

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:38.899 
bigger but this is more efficient and

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:42.289 
bigger but this is more efficient and
obviously<00:05:39.899> more<00:05:40.049> expensive<00:05:40.619> oh<00:05:41.209> it<00:05:42.209> smells

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:42.299 
obviously more expensive oh it smells

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:46.339 
obviously more expensive oh it smells
very<00:05:42.509> good<00:05:42.779> so<00:05:43.439> and<00:05:44.389> there<00:05:45.389> it<00:05:45.509> is<00:05:45.569> all<00:05:45.989> the

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
very good so and there it is all the

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.239 
very good so and there it is all the
connections<00:05:46.649> in<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:46.919> back<00:05:47.659> for<00:05:48.659> 12<00:05:49.409> pins<00:05:49.799> for

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 
connections in the back for 12 pins for

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.779 
connections in the back for 12 pins for
the<00:05:50.929> for<00:05:51.929> the<00:05:51.959> video<00:05:52.139> card<00:05:52.469> pci<00:05:52.949> express<00:05:53.339> and

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
the for the video card pci express and

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.269 
the for the video card pci express and
the<00:05:54.149> other<00:05:54.360> one<00:05:54.989> to<00:05:55.259> the<00:05:56.179> unique<00:05:57.179> pins<00:05:57.719> to<00:05:58.049> the

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279 
the other one to the unique pins to the

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.519 
the other one to the unique pins to the
internet<00:05:59.279> revolution<00:05:59.489> and<00:06:00.199> I<00:06:01.199> guess<00:06:01.379> it's

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
internet revolution and I guess it's

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.799 
internet revolution and I guess it's
where<00:06:01.649> all<00:06:01.709> your<00:06:01.889> hard<00:06:02.099> drives<00:06:02.399> and<00:06:03.089> molex

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:03.809 
where all your hard drives and molex

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:07.909 
where all your hard drives and molex
connectors<00:06:04.289> go<00:06:04.439> in<00:06:04.759> so<00:06:05.959> very<00:06:06.959> nice<00:06:07.289> very<00:06:07.619> well

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
connectors go in so very nice very well
