00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
it definitely look out for that fairly

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.069

soon in the upcoming weeks but yeah so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.959 
soon in the upcoming weeks but yeah so
far<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> computer<00:01:37.770> does<00:01:37.920> seem<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.279> be<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.609> lot

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
far the computer does seem to be a lot

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.910 
far the computer does seem to be a lot
faster<00:01:39.240> I've<00:01:39.539> got<00:01:39.689> SSD<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.439> I've<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.709> a<00:01:40.740> new

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
faster I've got SSD now I've got a new

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
faster I've got SSD now I've got a new
graphics<00:01:41.340> card<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.149> graphics<00:01:42.539> card<00:01:42.749> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
graphics card the graphics card is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.199 
graphics card the graphics card is
pretty<00:01:43.109> big<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> does<00:01:44.279> look<00:01:44.520> pretty<00:01:44.549> beefy

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
pretty big so it does look pretty beefy

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.419 
pretty big so it does look pretty beefy
and<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.719> goal<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.319> awesome<00:01:46.499> so<00:01:47.310> yeah

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
and the goal is really awesome so yeah

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.010 
and the goal is really awesome so yeah
I'm<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.520> happy<00:01:47.700> about<00:01:47.999> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I'm really happy about that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.419 
I'm really happy about that
apart<00:01:49.529> from<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.859> guess<00:01:50.130> there's<00:01:50.369> not

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
apart from that I guess there's not

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.550 
apart from that I guess there's not
really<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.700> talk<00:01:51.029> about<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:52.079> terms<00:01:52.319> like

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
really much talk about in terms like

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.859 
really much talk about in terms like
computer<00:01:53.039> specs<00:01:53.279> wise<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.849> do<00:01:54.119> still<00:01:54.599> need<00:01:54.779> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
computer specs wise I do still need to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.449 
computer specs wise I do still need to
do<00:01:54.959> some<00:01:54.990> overclocking<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.920> need<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.249> solve

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
do some overclocking I need to solve

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.940 
do some overclocking I need to solve
just<00:01:57.329> configure<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> few<00:01:57.959> things<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.499> guess<00:01:58.679> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
just configure a few things I guess so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.830 
just configure a few things I guess so
as<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.729> right<00:01:59.880> now<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.149> computer<00:02:00.689> isn't

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
as of right now the computer isn't

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
as of right now the computer isn't
exactly<00:02:01.349> how<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.609> terms<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
exactly how I want it in terms of the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.779 
exactly how I want it in terms of the
actual<00:02:03.659> build<00:02:04.020> itself<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.709> looks<00:02:04.919> awesome

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
actual build itself it looks awesome

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.089 
actual build itself it looks awesome
it<00:02:05.880> looks<00:02:06.240> wicked<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:06.929> opinion<00:02:07.319> I<00:02:07.499> put<00:02:07.950> some

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it looks wicked in my opinion I put some

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.650 
it looks wicked in my opinion I put some
lights<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.520> s<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:08.970> sort<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.420> like

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
lights and s you can sort of see like

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
lights and s you can sort of see like
the<00:02:10.170> components<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> size<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.549> window

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the components in the size of the window

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.940 
the components in the size of the window
so<00:02:12.299> I've<00:02:12.750> done<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.349> looks<00:02:13.560> cool<00:02:13.799> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.309 
the computer itself which I just need to
play<00:02:18.909> around<00:02:19.060> with<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.569> make<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.959> how<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.079> want

awesome stuff it does mean a lot so yeah

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.449 
awesome stuff it does mean a lot so yeah
definitely<00:03:29.530> more<00:03:29.889> or<00:03:29.979> less<00:03:30.069> progression

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
definitely more or less progression

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.830 
definitely more or less progression
videos<00:03:30.699> coming<00:03:31.000> out<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:31.359> really<00:03:31.629> soon

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
videos coming out really really soon

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.509 
videos coming out really really soon
obviously<00:03:32.560> because<00:03:32.769> they<00:03:32.919> are<00:03:33.010> quite<00:03:33.280> long

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
obviously because they are quite long

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.729 
obviously because they are quite long
and<00:03:33.729> it<00:03:33.909> takes<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.449> bit<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:34.989> time<00:03:35.229> I<00:03:35.379> guess<00:03:35.409> to

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
and it takes a bit of time I guess to

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.559 
and it takes a bit of time I guess to
solve<00:03:35.979> actually<00:03:36.250> make<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.639> bit<00:03:36.939> of<00:03:36.970> decent

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
solve actually make a bit of decent

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.960 
solve actually make a bit of decent
progress<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.500> episodes<00:03:39.069> do<00:03:39.280> take<00:03:39.549> about

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
progress the episodes do take about

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.719 
progress the episodes do take about
three<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.750> four<00:03:40.930> days<00:03:41.139> to<00:03:41.379> make<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.889> so<00:03:42.549> it's

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
three to four days to make and so it's

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.909 
three to four days to make and so it's
gonna<00:03:42.849> take<00:03:43.000> quite<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.269> long<00:03:43.329> time<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.629> guess<00:03:43.919> you

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
gonna take quite a long time I guess you

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.649 
gonna take quite a long time I guess you
know<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.400> solve<00:03:45.639> get<00:03:46.150> them<00:03:46.299> going<00:03:46.509> again

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
know just to solve get them going again

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.379 
know just to solve get them going again
but<00:03:47.049> wants<00:03:47.259> us<00:03:47.349> on<00:03:47.530> track<00:03:47.829> you<00:03:47.859> know<00:03:48.129> be<00:03:48.389> pretty

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
easy I guess it'll be a lot of fun so do

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.860 
easy I guess it'll be a lot of fun so do
