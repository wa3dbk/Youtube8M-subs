so<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.670> I'm<00:00:47.820> trying<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> say<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:49.530> step

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so what I'm trying to say is they step

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.500 
so what I'm trying to say is they step
up<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> big<00:00:50.340> games<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> big

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
up in the big games and this is a big

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
up in the big games and this is a big
game<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:52.170> very<00:00:52.230> true<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.680> step<00:00:53.070> up

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
game that's very true they do step up

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.170

as<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.290> psg<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.550> maybe<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.910> roll<00:02:15.090> out<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
as for psg I think maybe they roll out a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.490 
as for psg I think maybe they roll out a
team<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.570> has<00:02:15.600> two<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:15.960> three<00:02:16.080> changes<00:02:16.440> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
the regular starting eleven and then sub

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.790 
the regular starting eleven and then sub
off<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.570> star<00:02:18.750> players<00:02:19.020> at<00:02:19.200> halftime<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
off your star players at halftime or the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.590 
off your star players at halftime or the
60th<00:02:20.160> minute<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.700> keep<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
60th minute but just keep that that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
plane on a regular basis you're probably

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.150 
plane on a regular basis you're probably
right<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:25.920> thing<00:02:25.950> that's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
right there but I think one thing that's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.590 
right there but I think one thing that's
certain<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.700> there's<00:02:26.940> probably<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> be

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
certain is there's probably going to be

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.120 
certain is there's probably going to be
