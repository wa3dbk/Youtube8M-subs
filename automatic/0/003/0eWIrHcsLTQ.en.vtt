you guys to sponsor an episode of the
show<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.510> obviously<00:01:48.870> have<00:01:48.960> money<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.320> throw

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
show you obviously have money to throw

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
show you obviously have money to throw
away<00:01:49.590> why<00:01:49.830> not<00:01:50.010> throw<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:50.220> away<00:01:50.370> on<00:01:50.580> us<00:01:50.960> funeral

Technology Review 100 years ago people
didn't<00:02:35.910> understand<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.330> electron<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.900> they

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
didn't understand the electron so they

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.780 
didn't understand the electron so they
started<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.470> experiments<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:38.730> we

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
started to do experiments and now we

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
started to do experiments and now we
have<00:02:38.970> cell<00:02:39.450> phones<00:02:39.720> computers<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.560> millions

of<00:02:41.010> transistors<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.269> worth<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.570> to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
of transistors so is it worth it to
