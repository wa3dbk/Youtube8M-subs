00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.219
 Brazilians have never traveled so 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.160
 the outside and whenever they return to the country 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.199
 question is in the head because the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.970
 consumer goods cost a lot more expensive 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.010
 here in brazil than she was 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.420
 the reporter I decided she went in search 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.340
 of the answer 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 Brazil is the fourth largest market 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.340
 consumer of the world's 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.239
 fifth producer but in terms of prices 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.440
 is the first on the list is a dear never 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 more expensive here than in other countries 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 Do you think Argentina certainly is? 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.100
 united states at half the price is this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.329
 even the most expensive cars in the world 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.350
 are here at any dealership 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 compared with the same models 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 sold in other countries brazil shoots 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.260
 the front because the Brazilians pay 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.989
 more tax is not I know I went 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 now for time to argentina in a car 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.130
 that cost 100 thousand reais there costs 48 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.010
 she hit the Argentines pay less 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.110
 but the fault is not of the taxes is the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.390
 story of what to wear glued 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 the journalist specializing in the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.369
 detailed survey 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.280
 the automakers do not openly admit 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.590
 but they set the prices that they think 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 consumers will be able to afford to pay 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 a large profit margin of up to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.540
 the cars manufactured here in Brazil and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.150
 dispatched to other countries by ship 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.490
 reached the final destination with prices well 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.369
 lower than the prices charged 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.829
 in Brazilian concessionaires 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.409
 one of the most striking examples is the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.860
 car manufactured in sumaré interior of 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.149
 São Paulo it costs 25 thousand and eight hundred 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.619
 Real estate in mexico in brazil is sold by 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.049
 56 thousand two hundred reais 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.450
 joel took the trouble to discount the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.860
 taxes of 16 thousand and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 four hundred reais 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.259
 the profit margin of the concessionaires in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.619
 range of 10% and yet the difference 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.210
 almost 10,000 real cost of living in the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.530
 Brazil is much more expensive than in 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.700
 this other one costs $ 15,450 dollars in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.100
 united states 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.170
 twenty-one thousand six hundred and fifty 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.160
 eight in Argentina and 37 1636 dollars in the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.890
 Brazil and this 32 thousand five hundred reais 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.920
 in mexico 65,700 in brazil the collection of 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.860
 taxes does not explain so much difference 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.350
 but if the consumer pays the salty price 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.050
 joel received many messages 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.320
 because he explained that the difference is 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.170
 margin of profit but the problem is limited 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.920
 to luxury cars that are abusive in the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.850
 Brazil 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.530
 What's worth buying here? 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.050
 all Brazilians traveling to the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.690
 exterior in any without the prices 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.600
 of electronics outside 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.830
 the world's most wanted tablet is 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.950
 costing 2,599 reais in Brazil in the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.500
 United States one thousand three hundred and fifty 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.040
 Real in clothes and shoes in Brazil 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.980
 also are see more expensive this sneakers 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.020
 for Americans comes out for 250 reais 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.880
 for Brazilians 549 in recent years 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.820
 the Brazilian purchasing power increased 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.430
 now the greater number of people can 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.650
 buy and have access to credit exists 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.230
 a fan to buy and there is also a 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.260
 competitiveness in the different 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.300
 markets in Brazil in which it operates 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
 instead you have a more competitive 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.300
 low 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.880
 evidently that the margins are more 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.060
 high one-hour minor competition 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.910
 in hands the Brazilian cost alone does not 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.910
 explains such a price difference
