that<00:01:21.810> goal<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> only<00:01:22.920> goal

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that goal because that was the only goal

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
that goal because that was the only goal
that<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.610> missing<00:01:23.940> I<00:01:24.090> decided<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> play<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

it's<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.440> be<00:01:31.650> enough<00:01:31.890> looking<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:32.760> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's gonna be enough looking at the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's gonna be enough looking at the
result<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.450> qualifications<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:34.500> surface

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
protocol of my main competitors I was

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.190 
protocol of my main competitors I was
pretty<00:01:38.310> sure<00:01:38.520> 200<00:01:38.940> meters<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.510> 200

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pretty sure 200 meters would be 200

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.500 
pretty sure 200 meters would be 200
enter<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:40.830> be<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.370> enough<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
enter and will be more than enough so I

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.780 
enter and will be more than enough so I
gambled<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.110> bit<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.440> went<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:44.010> until<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> 6

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
gambled a bit I went out until the 6

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
gambled a bit I went out until the 6
even<00:01:45.000> though<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> could<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.960> done<00:01:46.280> at<00:01:47.280> least

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
even though I could have done at least

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.320 
even though I could have done at least
10<00:01:47.700> meters<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.570> realistically<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:50.330> it

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
10 meters I think realistically and it

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.480 
10 meters I think realistically and it
was<00:01:51.510> enough<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.900> a<00:01:51.960> goal<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.799> second<00:01:53.369> guy

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
was enough for a goal but the second guy

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399 
was enough for a goal but the second guy
my<00:01:53.820> teammate<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.690> like<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.900> fella<00:01:55.140> from

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
my teammate actually like a fella from

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.969 
my teammate actually like a fella from
Croatia<00:01:55.710> being<00:01:56.220> only<00:01:56.520> 6<00:01:56.880> meters<00:01:57.270> away<00:01:57.510> from<00:01:57.659> me

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
Croatia being only 6 meters away from me

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.240 
Croatia being only 6 meters away from me
it<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> close<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.500> after<00:02:01.500> no<00:02:01.890> Finn's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it was kind of close so after no Finn's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.000 
it was kind of close so after no Finn's
final<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:03.240> first<00:02:03.540> gold<00:02:03.750> medal<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.799> kind

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
final and my first gold medal I was kind

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
final and my first gold medal I was kind
of<00:02:05.070> relieved<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:06.080> I<00:02:07.080> was<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.340> nervous<00:02:08.580> for

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
of relieved and I was not so nervous for
