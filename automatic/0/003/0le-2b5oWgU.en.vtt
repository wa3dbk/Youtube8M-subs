rear you have those same LED lights and

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.690 
rear you have those same LED lights and
that's<00:02:02.140> really<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.470> safety<00:02:02.860> thing<00:02:03.040> I<00:02:03.340> already

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
that's really a safety thing I already

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.010 
that's really a safety thing I already
kind<00:02:03.909> of<00:02:04.030> tweaked<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.390> made<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.689> their<00:02:04.840> own

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
kind of tweaked it made it their own

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.270 
kind of tweaked it made it their own
and<00:02:05.320> add<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> little<00:02:05.500> bit<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.829> style<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.250> it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
and add a little bit of style to it

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.310 
and add a little bit of style to it
having<00:02:06.549> that<00:02:06.790> distinctive<00:02:07.360> right<00:02:07.810> look<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.200> it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
having that distinctive right look to it

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.590 
having that distinctive right look to it
but<00:02:09.040> it<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.519> safety<00:02:09.820> feature<00:02:10.060> people<00:02:10.360> see

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
but it is a safety feature people see

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.060
