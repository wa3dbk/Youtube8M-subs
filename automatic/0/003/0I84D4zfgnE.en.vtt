at<00:01:35.090> first<00:01:36.050> glance<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.830> might<00:01:37.280> be<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> little<00:01:37.700> bit

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
at first glance it might be a little bit

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.390 
at first glance it might be a little bit
hard<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.270> tell<00:01:38.570> but<00:01:38.810> I've<00:01:39.440> actually<00:01:39.770> looked

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
hard to tell but I've actually looked

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.360 
hard to tell but I've actually looked
these<00:01:40.730> long<00:01:41.060> enough<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:42.260> find<00:01:42.770> out

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
these long enough to find out

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.210 
these long enough to find out
you<00:01:43.820> know<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:45.290> differences<00:01:45.710> maybe<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.100> can

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
you know the differences maybe you can

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.450 
you know the differences maybe you can
spot<00:01:46.490> them<00:01:46.730> right<00:01:46.910> away<00:01:49.000> they<00:01:50.000> both<00:01:50.210> have

pickups<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:45.200> guitar<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.830> court<00:02:47.500> has<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
pickups this guitar the court has the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.979 
pickups this guitar the court has the
Blues<00:02:49.310> buckers<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.060> which<00:02:50.239> are<00:02:50.420> actually

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
Blues buckers in it which are actually

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.810 
Blues buckers in it which are actually
really<00:02:51.200> nice<00:02:51.500> for<00:02:51.920> stock<00:02:52.160> pickups

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.660 

now<00:02:55.820> one<00:02:56.030> thing<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.240> will<00:02:56.420> say<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.640> both<00:02:58.640> of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
now one thing I will say is that both of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.890 
now one thing I will say is that both of
these<00:02:58.970> guitars<00:02:59.240> have<00:03:01.840> push-pull<00:03:02.840> taps<00:03:03.170> right

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
these guitars have push-pull taps right

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.330 
these guitars have push-pull taps right
so<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.260> could<00:03:06.410> basically<00:03:06.560> turn<00:03:07.010> them<00:03:07.190> into

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
so you could basically turn them into

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.480 
so you could basically turn them into
Stratocasters<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.470> court<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:10.160> courts

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
Stratocasters but the court the courts

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.550 
Stratocasters but the court the courts
not<00:03:10.670> wired<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.360> way<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.660> says<00:03:11.960> it<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
not wired the way it says it is on the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.110 
not wired the way it says it is on the
website<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:13.190> I'm<00:03:13.310> not<00:03:13.490> sure<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:13.820> that's<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
website and I'm not sure if that's a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.180 
website and I'm not sure if that's a
factory<00:03:14.570> problem<00:03:15.170> or<00:03:15.380> if<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.620> websites<00:03:16.070> just

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
factory problem or if the websites just

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.330 
factory problem or if the websites just
wrong<00:03:16.610> basically<00:03:17.600> this<00:03:17.840> guitar<00:03:18.230> even<00:03:18.800> with

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
wrong basically this guitar even with

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.990 
wrong basically this guitar even with
the<00:03:19.670> tap<00:03:19.940> pulled<00:03:20.300> out<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.780> always<00:03:21.020> humbucker

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
the tap pulled out is always humbucker

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.700 
the tap pulled out is always humbucker
single<00:03:23.000> single<00:03:24.520> or<00:03:25.520> with<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.850> tap<00:03:26.060> in

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
single single or with the tap in

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.430 
single single or with the tap in
humbucker<00:03:27.710> single<00:03:28.130> humbucker<00:03:28.960> but<00:03:29.960> according

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
humbucker single humbucker but according

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.930 
humbucker single humbucker but according
to<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.620> website<00:03:30.770> with<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.340> tap<00:03:31.520> out<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
to the website with the tap out it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.640 
to the website with the tap out it
should<00:03:32.120> be<00:03:32.150> single<00:03:33.020> single<00:03:33.680> single<00:03:34.810> not<00:03:35.810> hum

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
should be single single single not hum

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.830 
should be single single single not hum
single<00:03:37.220> single<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.760> there's<00:03:38.420> some<00:03:38.630> type<00:03:38.810> of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
single single so there's some type of

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.570 
single single so there's some type of
discrepancy<00:03:39.680> there's<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.980> problem

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
discrepancy there's a problem

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.640 
discrepancy there's a problem
this<00:03:41.090> guitar<00:03:41.300> though<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.960> wired<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.590> way

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
this guitar though is wired that way

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.140 
this guitar though is wired that way
basically<00:03:43.580> with<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.030> tap<00:03:44.510> up<00:03:45.190> it's<00:03:46.190> it's

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
basically with that tap up it's it's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.020 
basically with that tap up it's it's
humbuckers<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.900> one<00:03:48.590> single<00:03:48.980> coil<00:03:49.250> with<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
humbuckers and one single coil with the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.300 
humbuckers and one single coil with the
tap<00:03:50.240> down<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:51.080> backwards<00:03:51.380> for<00:03:51.830> some<00:03:52.010> reason

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
tap down it's backwards for some reason

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.830 
tap down it's backwards for some reason
I'm<00:03:52.400> not<00:03:52.430> sure<00:03:52.730> why<00:03:52.910> probably<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.450> factory

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
I'm not sure why probably a factory

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.780 
I'm not sure why probably a factory
thing<00:03:54.110> with<00:03:54.710> the<00:03:54.860> tap<00:03:55.070> down

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
thing with the tap down

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.720 
thing with the tap down
it's<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:57.560> Stratocaster<00:03:58.480> basically<00:04:00.160> now<00:04:01.160> you

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
it's a Stratocaster basically now you

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.810 
it's a Stratocaster basically now you
might<00:04:01.910> also<00:04:01.940> notice<00:04:02.540> that<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:03.050> on<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.800> x6<00:04:04.640> is

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
might also notice that the on the x6 is

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.580
