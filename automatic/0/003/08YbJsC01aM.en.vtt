and my honest opinions this book is a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040 
and my honest opinions this book is a
little<00:00:25.590> complicated<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.640> explain<00:00:27.119> but

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
little complicated to explain but

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
little complicated to explain but
essentially<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.920> dystopian<00:00:29.400> futuristic

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
essentially it's a dystopian futuristic

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.250 
essentially it's a dystopian futuristic
world<00:00:30.800> in<00:00:31.800> Florida<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> area<00:00:33.870> order

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
world in Florida and in this area order

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
world in Florida and in this area order
rate<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.710> higher<00:00:35.070> than<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.610> birth<00:00:35.760> rate<00:00:36.059> which

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
rate is higher than the birth rate which

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.490 
rate is higher than the birth rate which
is<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:36.989> interesting

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is very interesting

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
is very interesting
our<00:00:37.860> main<00:00:38.040> character<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.910> never<00:00:39.180> seen<00:00:39.629> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
very vulnerable or emotional but then we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.930 
very vulnerable or emotional but then we
have<00:03:35.709> Zef<00:03:36.070> who<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:37.860> kind<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.950> emotional<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.850> I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940

said<00:03:40.150> he<00:03:40.239> feels<00:03:40.420> really<00:03:40.630> guilty<00:03:40.840> about

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
said he feels really guilty about

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.509 
said he feels really guilty about
killing<00:03:41.620> all<00:03:41.680> these<00:03:41.920> people<00:03:42.250> he<00:03:42.370> doesn't

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
killing all these people he doesn't

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.860 
killing all these people he doesn't
really<00:03:42.670> know<00:03:42.850> why<00:03:43.030> he's<00:03:43.269> killing<00:03:43.480> all<00:03:43.660> these

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
really know why he's killing all these

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.710 
really know why he's killing all these
people<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.280> he<00:03:45.670> definitely<00:03:46.209> shows<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> lot

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
people and so he definitely shows a lot

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.300 
people and so he definitely shows a lot
of<00:03:46.810> emotions<00:03:47.290> when<00:03:47.590> him<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:47.920> meadow<00:03:48.070> are

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
of emotions when him and meadow are

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.500 
of emotions when him and meadow are
together<00:03:48.580> it's<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.300> interesting

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
together it's a really interesting

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.110 
together it's a really interesting
dynamic<00:03:49.900> between<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.620> both<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.860> them<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.550> I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
dynamic between the both of them and I

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.520 
dynamic between the both of them and I
think<00:03:52.360> he<00:03:52.510> kind<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.780> brings<00:03:53.080> out<00:03:53.230> some

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
think he kind of brings out some

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.500 
think he kind of brings out some
vulnerability<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.519> meadow<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.269> one<00:03:55.420> of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
vulnerability and meadow this is one of

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.030 
vulnerability and meadow this is one of
those<00:03:55.630> books<00:03:55.870> where<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.170> start<00:03:56.530> out<00:03:56.709> not

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
really knowing much you kind of get

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.150 
really knowing much you kind of get
thrown<00:03:58.750> into<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.110> world<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.470> little<00:03:59.709> bit<00:03:59.860> and

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
engaging and tense at times and just a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.970

really easy book to get through however

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.460 
really easy book to get through however
I<00:04:12.340> will<00:04:12.730> say<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.780> couldn't<00:04:14.110> give<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.290> five

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
I will say that I couldn't give it five

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.430 
I will say that I couldn't give it five
stars<00:04:14.500> because<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.610> felt<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.959> world<00:04:17.260> in

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
stars because I felt that the world in

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.640 
stars because I felt that the world in
the<00:04:17.530> plot<00:04:17.769> at<00:04:18.010> times<00:04:18.310> was<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:18.669> little<00:04:19.209> too

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
the plot at times was a little too

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.610 
the plot at times was a little too
complicated<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.760> was<00:04:22.450> just<00:04:22.630> confused<00:04:23.140> at

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
complicated and I was just confused at

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.420 
complicated and I was just confused at
multiple

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
multiple

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.250 
multiple
I<00:04:24.699> don't<00:04:25.210> know<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.330> mean<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.780> Lindsay's

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
overwhelmed and confused and I was just

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.930

sequels I think this this book
definitely<00:05:09.400> left<00:05:10.000> off<00:05:10.210> on<00:05:10.539> a<00:05:10.570> major

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
definitely left off on a major

definitely left off on a major
cliffhanger<00:05:11.979> like<00:05:12.340> almost<00:05:13.270> ending<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:13.840> the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900
