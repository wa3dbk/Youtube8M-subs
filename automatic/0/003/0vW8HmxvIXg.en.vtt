before<00:01:05.309> which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.030> bizarre<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> me

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
before which is just bizarre to me

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.640 
before which is just bizarre to me
because<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:06.990> that'd<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.470> an

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
because you would think that'd be an

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
because you would think that'd be an
irritant<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> skin<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.210> doesn't

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
irritant to the skin but this doesn't

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
irritant to the skin but this doesn't
this<00:01:09.990> has<00:01:10.140> no<00:01:10.290> fragrance<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this has no fragrance so the thing that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.010 
this has no fragrance so the thing that
I<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.960> most<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.960> before<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
I like most about this is I before I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
I like most about this is I before I
even<00:01:16.200> tried<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.830> read<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
even tried it and I read that it was you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
even tried it and I read that it was you
know<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> gel<00:01:18.390> cream<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.049> kinda<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
know it's a gel cream I kinda have the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
know it's a gel cream I kinda have the
perception<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.490> put<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
perception that I was gonna put it on it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.210 
perception that I was gonna put it on it
was<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.450> soak<00:01:21.689> into<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:21.960> face<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.950> was

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
was gonna soak into my face and that was

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
was gonna soak into my face and that was
gonna<00:01:23.310> begin<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> wasn't<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.030> gonna<00:01:24.119> do

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
gonna begin it wasn't really gonna do

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
gonna begin it wasn't really gonna do
much<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.990> pleasantly<00:01:25.350> surprised<00:01:25.650> because

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
much it was pleasantly surprised because

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.810 
much it was pleasantly surprised because
I<00:01:26.430> put<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.720> although<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> had<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.340> had

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I put this on and although I had I had

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
I put this on and although I had I had
it<00:01:29.970> soak<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.780> saturate<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.200> face<00:01:31.470> there

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it soak in and saturate my face there

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.600 
it soak in and saturate my face there
was<00:01:32.280> enough<00:01:32.700> left<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.689> top<00:01:33.900> layer<00:01:34.170> that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
was enough left on the top layer that

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
was enough left on the top layer that
kept<00:01:35.610> moisturizing<00:01:36.299> without<00:01:36.570> being<00:01:36.840> greasy

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
kept moisturizing without being greasy

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
kept moisturizing without being greasy
and<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:37.979> hard

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and I think that's a really hard

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.550 
and I think that's a really hard
combination<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.000> by<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> skincare<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
combination to come by and skincare and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
combination to come by and skincare and
