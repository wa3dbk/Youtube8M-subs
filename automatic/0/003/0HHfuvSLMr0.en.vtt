actually really liked this hairstyle

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.460 
actually really liked this hairstyle
because<00:00:16.500> um<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.550> was<00:00:17.880> able<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.539> wear<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
because um I was able to wear it for a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
because um I was able to wear it for a
really<00:00:19.710> long<00:00:19.890> time<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.060> still<00:00:21.270> looks

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
really long time and it still looks

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.730 
really long time and it still looks
pretty<00:00:21.900> decent

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
pretty decent

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.269 
pretty decent
until<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:23.430> about<00:00:23.670> two<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:25.260> side<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.859> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
until now about two on this side and it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.189 
until now about two on this side and it
was<00:00:26.430> actually<00:00:26.609> pretty<00:00:26.789> difficult<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.869> take<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
was actually pretty difficult to take it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
was actually pretty difficult to take it
out<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.859> hair<00:00:29.099> still<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.760> same<00:00:29.970> length

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
out with the hair still the same length

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.580 
out with the hair still the same length

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that should make it a lot easier to take

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.590 
that should make it a lot easier to take
out<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> hair<00:00:49.110> cuz<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:50.309> tree<00:00:50.969> braids<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
out the hair cuz it tree braids I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260 
out the hair cuz it tree braids I
actually<00:00:51.870> found<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.730> singles<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> do

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
actually found like singles when you do

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
actually found like singles when you do
tree<00:00:54.930> braids<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> singles<00:00:55.770> they're<00:00:55.949> really

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
tree braids and singles they're really

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.720 
tree braids and singles they're really
really<00:00:56.550> hard<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> take<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.730> remember

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really hard to take out like I remember

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
really hard to take out like I remember
putting<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:01.050> years<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> years<00:01:01.739> ago

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
putting them in like years and years ago

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520 
putting them in like years and years ago
and<00:01:02.250> hating<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.930> basically

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and hating them because I basically

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
and hating them because I basically
could<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> damn<00:01:06.840> things<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> my

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
could not get the damn things out of my

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.350 
could not get the damn things out of my
head

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
head

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.140 
head
so<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:10.290> easier<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.580> but

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so these they're easier to take out but

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
so these they're easier to take out but
they're<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.140> easy<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.740> crochet<00:01:14.280> braids

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
they're not as easy as crochet braids

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600 
they're not as easy as crochet braids
are<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.290> crochet<00:01:17.070> braids<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
piece in here will slip right out with

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.940 
piece in here will slip right out with
the<00:01:21.360> braids<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.710> these<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.950> go

the braids but with these you have to go
through<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> braid

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

pull my hair out strand by strand once I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
pull my hair out strand by strand once I

got closer to the front of the braid I'm
doing<00:02:29.260> these<00:02:29.380> videos<00:02:29.500> just<00:02:30.190> simply<00:02:30.640> document

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
doing these videos just simply document

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660

different hairstyles techniques and so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.690 
different hairstyles techniques and so
takedowns<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.420> each<00:02:34.720> um<00:02:35.410> after<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:36.010> took<00:02:36.370> this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
takedowns of each um after I took this
