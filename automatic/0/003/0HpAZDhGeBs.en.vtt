00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.140
 hello with you again I tssn carp 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.080
 today we will talk about how 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 correct our proportions if you already 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.320
 tried on and went the easy way 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 have tried 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.029
 narrow your waistline with 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.550
 high intensity workouts with 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.540
 cardio with a diet but this is not for you 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.820
 helped a lot 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.590
 Today I will tell you how to do it. 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.890
 all the same to cope with our 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.559
 problems of this type of figure and taken 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.199
 call in the people 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:53.239
 rectangle well or boy figure 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.309
 how i fixed my products i can 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.620
 show you 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.900
 I corrected my proportions with 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.850
 the fact that I increased my broadest 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.930
 muscle deal a lot of workouts on 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.100
 a place 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.400
 and also I had ears chunks walking i 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.740
 did a lot of exercises on the middle 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.360
 gluteus muscle but not naturally 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.210
 forgetting about basic exercises 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.840
 go to the simulator beak throne if you do not 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.910
 know yourself even yourself 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.160
 pull up then this is his simulator in 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.640
 help to swing the broadest 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.510
 back muscles need almost 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.250
 all exercises take wide grip 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.380
 hi, aren't you surprised that we are 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.240
 picture stuck in the role all over again 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.000
 us just now reality shows and for us 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.430
 important and small ad regards 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.860
 Thursday we did not lead a little wrong 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.250
 you corrected us thank you very much for 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.290
 Well, on Thursday gr4 will be separate 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.030
 video actually about reality TV 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.740
 our future plans therefore 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.690
 be sure to go on thursday to our 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 channel and see at home what we want 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.350
 make it together with you is important to us 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.240
 what do you think about it see all 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.320
 I don't like my genetics 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.250
 is always 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.100
 the water around the abdomen 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.989
 problem area I like as I said 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.080
 I go forever with a life preserver 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.280
 like that the legs dry quickly at all 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.980
 I have them very quickly swinging I do not 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 on the effort put them so that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.190
 they came to me in good shape 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.650
 average gluteus muscles are good for 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.180
 Girls who have a narrow pelvis of 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.410
 there are a lot of girls 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.630
 we swing it for what when we stand and have 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.640
 us pumped these again 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 I repeat and even then I do not know that we do not 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.650
 should do the big exercise 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.010
 gluteus or other groups 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.930
 leg muscles we have to do all the exercises 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.690
 and basic insulating 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.750
 but if we want to correct the proportions 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.550
 must necessarily be in each probably in 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
 your training every day include 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.890
 it is their exercise data for what it is 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.040
 need more expressions 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 medium 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.019
 gluteus muscles and due to this when we 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.130
 we stand especially when we are straining them 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.530
 we have become 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.610
 visually also begins to seem already 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.730
 Now we want just our average 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.280
 pounds but I can't right now 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.870
 put back this simulator because 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.510
 that unfortunately there is no such 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.580
 opportunities usually in the hall I have her completely 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 I recline my back and lie down straight because 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.370
 what it gives exactly the greater load on 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.370
 our muscles 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.170
 very effective exercise I am very 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.650
 love this simulator because not only 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.500
 that we swing our favorite muscles on it and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.510
 plus you can always relax here 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.320
 because 30 leg training is always 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.580
 difficult training and she 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.530
 high intensity as well as training 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.850
 backs in principle because as we know 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.610
 these are the most for our large muscle groups 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.100
 I keep a diary of my weight and each 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.140
 I weigh myself every morning and keep a diary 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.080
 but I'm not doing this to 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.590
 get upset when I get up 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.450
 per kilogram I just control 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.820
 fermentation of water in my body because as 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.340
 I already told me this problem I am 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.530
 I can get up in the morning dry dry at me 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.480
 all cut resemble half an hour and I have everything 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.100
 poured water now start 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.710
 to train more 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.560
 high intensity training at this 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.710
 moment we eliminated cardio so how how 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.560
 nor strange but floods me after cardio 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.090
 I always increase my weight 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.670
 the body perceives it as stress and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.960
 accordingly immediately deposits water 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.750
 and 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.440
 and at the moment I try not to do 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.810
 cardio 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.130
 and the workouts themselves are something like 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.440
 circuit training 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.750
 that is, a lot of rest between approaches and 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.090
 I repeat with some frequency 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.220
 did exercise 5 and went round 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.110
 repeat now show exercises 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.949
 which can be used very well 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.800
 as warming up before say the same 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.840
 workout but it's better to do it with 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.849
 weighting at this time next 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.280
 no weighting so no losing 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.610
 time let me show you just what 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.569
 what to do 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.500
 we all know it is nothing new to you 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.990
 now don't show but if done with 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.969
 weights just we will cry 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:51.070
 or our 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:54.100
 muscle weighting is insulated verb 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.820
 we catch the more the better and do 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:01.090
 This exercise but here naturally on 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.510
 this danger also other types of this 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.600
 Exercise you probably saw something like that 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.870
 Hall do girls I personally I am part 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.140
 I often see how they do it when 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.500
 clings to the bottom grog u put weight he 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.280
 cuff cling button 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.280
 pull the wire lips 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.900
 as follows 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.620
 as the gluteus medius muscle is with us 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:35.840
 responsible for leg breeding 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.000
 accordingly, if you catch the logic 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.400
 all exercises are done with 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.860
 breeding legs secondary many 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.870
 I care about the question of time for what time I 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.520
 I will achieve the result as much as I 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.800
 will need to pump some 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.199
 muscle group i want you urgently 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.969
 advise not to think about it 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.669
 concentrate on the main thing 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:58.159
 and the main thing is that the main thing is to go to the gym 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.560
 motivated motivate your 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.509
 achievements if you motivate with 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.060
 a photo of another girl 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:07.370
 Well, maybe you have enough for one to 5 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.120
 workouts and if you motivate your 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.279
 achievements then this is to the eternal first 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.029
 the results in the hall they go enough 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:19.279
 fast you go to the gym during the first 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:22.129
 2 months together you see how your body 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:24.409
 begins to change further it goes into 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:27.529
 habit results are already going more 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.750
 with less speed but your body 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:33.710
 will require you to go to 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.169
 hall and continue to engage in custody 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.300
 I want to say to 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.120
 all subscribed to the yougifted channel 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:44.169
 to always put huskies 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:48.120
 especially I was connected with you 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:48.120
 hang on happy 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.120
 hi all swami rum sergey
