00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
and saying they like I'm so part of the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.570 
and saying they like I'm so part of the
team<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.690> still<00:04:25.900> mean<00:04:26.080> me<00:04:26.290> just<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:27.310> really

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
team and still mean me just it really

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.400 
team and still mean me just it really
helped<00:04:27.880> but<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.570> was<00:04:28.750> not<00:04:28.900> an<00:04:29.080> easy<00:04:29.229> experience

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
helped but it was not an easy experience

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.610 
helped but it was not an easy experience
at<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.370> our<00:04:30.940> best<00:04:31.240> player<00:04:31.540> got<00:04:31.810> hurt<00:04:32.020> our<00:04:32.290> best

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
at all our best player got hurt our best

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.980 
at all our best player got hurt our best
defensive<00:04:33.130> player<00:04:33.310> got<00:04:33.580> hurt<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.660> think

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
defensive player got hurt and I think

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.439 
defensive player got hurt and I think
that<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.710> tee<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.280> benefited<00:04:37.060> our<00:04:37.180> team

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
that to the tee it benefited our team

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.760 
that to the tee it benefited our team
because<00:04:37.810> they<00:04:37.930> were<00:04:37.990> able<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.350> pull<00:04:38.650> together

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
because they were able to pull together

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.469 
because they were able to pull together
and<00:04:39.340> further<00:04:40.560> unify<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.889> solidified<00:04:42.550> just

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
and further unify and solidified just

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.540 
and further unify and solidified just
like<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.840> passing<00:04:44.289> of<00:04:44.560> my<00:04:44.740> father<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.340> was

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
like the passing of my father it was

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.430 
like the passing of my father it was
only<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.880> tip<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.330> iceberg<00:04:46.389> with<00:04:47.050> my<00:04:47.199> father

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
only a tip of the iceberg with my father

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.620 
only a tip of the iceberg with my father
passing<00:04:47.770> away<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.370> for<00:04:48.550> them<00:04:48.729> you<00:04:49.419> know<00:04:49.570> to

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630

for Sam to be hurt it had the same kind
of<00:04:54.520> impact
