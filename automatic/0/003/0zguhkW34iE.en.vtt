00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.220
 attention without exception of the whole world to these 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.960
 minutes are chained to Minsk here 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.400
 negotiations have ended presidents of countries 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.740
 Customs Union with the participation of the head 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.959
 Ukraine and politicians from Brussels they 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 lasted more than 4 hours I will note the main 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.509
 The topic of the meeting is devoted to the situation on 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 Ukraine 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.100
 President Peter Poroshenko whose visit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.050
 to the last has been in doubt already 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.580
 Said that depends on the meeting in Minsk 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.580
 not much is not enough the fate of Europe and the world 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.530
 now something 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.020
 the main theme of the meeting military action 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.360
 in the south-east of Ukraine meeting 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.309
 began with the appeal of Lukashenko in which 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.390
 he urged to drop ambitions to think about 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.629
 the fate of ordinary people is paramount 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.980
 the task to stop at any cost 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.320
 bloodshed 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.100
 to achieve peace and war is the path to nowhere 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.280
 this is a dead end to get out of which 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.040
 extremely difficult to unwind she is a 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.650
 spiral mutual charges ultimatum 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.630
 sanctions are fraught with the fact that the new 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.229
 dividing line will be no longer on 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.659
 paper 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.020
 and will become real deep wounds on 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.090
 Europe's body from Ukraine Petro Poroshenko 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.950
 urged the assembled presidents 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.409
 support his peace plan to resolve 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.890
 crisis head of Kazakhstan Nursultan 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.600
 Nazarbayev 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.130
 already proposed to create a foundation 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.590
 restoration of Donbass 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.780
 damage from warfare estimated 8 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.750
 billion dollars poroshenko idea 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.010
 supported and I am grateful 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.020
 most of those sitting here for what 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.170
 President’s peace plan was decidedly 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.760
 also supported by the majority 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.280
 Member States 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.610
 united nations i'm convinced that this 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.660
 plan and today is relevant 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.470
 the only possible tool 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.620
 ending bloodshed and ensuring 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.600
 post-conflict reconstruction of Donbass 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.400
 another topic for discussion is the implications 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.610
 for the economy of the customs union from 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.959
 Ukraine’s accession to the EU damage 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.700
 from this according to the Russian 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.420
 President will be 100 billion 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 rubles 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.800
 only by conservative estimate but because 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.660
 drew Putin of Russia and the rest 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.640
 union members will be forced to take 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.640
 retaliate we are of course attentive 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.290
 in the most way we will have to look at 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.060
 the use of our Ukrainian friends in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.830
 in accordance with agreements 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.850
 osiris associations are sanitary norms and 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.739
 we will introduce 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.750
 mirror norms today we have very 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.610
 flexible regulation in this area we 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.180
 we see the same exact norms regarding 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.470
 of Ukraine 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.540
 and as for the industry it 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.180
 one of the most important components here 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.390
 is unconditionally as I said on 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.530
 method of determining the country of origin 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.720
 commodity and we have great suspicions i 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.930
 already talked about this and the big threat that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.209
 through the territory of Ukraine will go 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.100
 European goods are now at the delegates 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.840
 break is expected that the meeting 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.840
 there will be a briefing of leaders
