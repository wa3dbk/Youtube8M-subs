I<00:02:03.820> do<00:02:04.120> use<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.480> dock<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.020> really<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.590> use<00:02:05.800> this

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
I do use the dock I really just use this

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.980 
I do use the dock I really just use this
as<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.250> kind<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.760> resting<00:02:07.240> spot<00:02:07.540> for<00:02:07.750> my<00:02:07.810> iPhone

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
as a kind of resting spot for my iPhone

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.589 
as a kind of resting spot for my iPhone
but<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.069> could<00:02:09.280> take<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.119> know<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:10.479> that

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
but you could take it you know so that

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.750 
but you could take it you know so that
it<00:02:10.660> was<00:02:10.780> all<00:02:10.929> ready<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.200> go<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:12.640> would

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
it was all ready to go and you would

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.220 
it was all ready to go and you would
always<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.450> cable<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:13.959> when<00:02:14.140> you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
always have the cable there when you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.330 
always have the cable there when you
wanted<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.530> do<00:02:14.620> your<00:02:14.739> charging<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.310> syncing

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
power support I stumbled across these

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.420 
power support I stumbled across these
things<00:02:50.120> I'm<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> big<00:02:50.750> fan<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.250> anti<00:02:52.250> glare

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
things I'm a big fan of anti glare

things I'm a big fan of anti glare
screen<00:02:52.970> protectors<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.900> guess<00:02:54.350> what<00:02:54.530> guys

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
screen protectors and guess what guys

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.830 
screen protectors and guess what guys
these<00:02:55.010> are<00:02:55.250> under<00:02:55.700> five<00:02:56.060> dollars

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
these are under five dollars

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.920 
these are under five dollars
they<00:02:57.380> sell<00:02:57.680> for<00:02:57.710> four<00:02:58.160> dollars<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.820> 89<00:02:59.180> cents

they sell for four dollars and 89 cents

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.490 
they sell for four dollars and 89 cents
each<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:01.250> can<00:03:01.430> see<00:03:01.670> they're<00:03:02.000> almost

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
each and you can see they're almost

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.350 
each and you can see they're almost
identical<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:04.160> power<00:03:04.370> support<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.150> mean

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
identical to the power support I mean

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.110 
identical to the power support I mean
III<00:03:05.810> think<00:03:06.050> if<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.740> know<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.160> put<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.520> on<00:03:07.580> I

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
III think if you know you put these on I

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.460 
III think if you know you put these on I
don't<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.050> could<00:03:09.260> tell<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
don't know that I could tell the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.170 
don't know that I could tell the
difference<00:03:09.500> between<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.280> power<00:03:10.460> support<00:03:11.000> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
difference between the power support and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.810 
difference between the power support and
I'm<00:03:11.480> almost<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.170> go<00:03:12.320> as<00:03:12.590> far<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.340> SGP

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
I'm almost going to go as far as the SGP

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.240 
I'm almost going to go as far as the SGP
I<00:03:14.360> mean<00:03:14.750> they're<00:03:14.930> thin<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.620> SGP

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
I mean they're thin like the SGP

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.370 
I mean they're thin like the SGP
they're<00:03:16.730> narrow<00:03:17.030> like<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.480> SGP<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.260> they

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
they're narrow like the SGP so they

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.900 
they're narrow like the SGP so they
won't<00:03:18.530> bubble<00:03:18.950> with<00:03:19.100> your<00:03:19.250> slider<00:03:19.550> style

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
won't bubble with your slider style

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.990 
won't bubble with your slider style
cases<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:21.050> like<00:03:21.230> anti<00:03:21.980> glare<00:03:22.160> you've<00:03:22.790> got

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
cases if you like anti glare you've got

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.880 
cases if you like anti glare you've got
to<00:03:23.180> try<00:03:23.360> these<00:03:23.420> out<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:24.140> definitely<00:03:24.470> worth

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
to try these out it's definitely worth

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.820 
to try these out it's definitely worth
you<00:03:25.460> know<00:03:25.490> ordering<00:03:26.030> up<00:03:26.210> one<00:03:26.630> film<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.680> and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
you know ordering up one film and and
