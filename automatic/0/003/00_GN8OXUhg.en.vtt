magic<00:02:59.870> regenerates<00:03:00.560> faster<00:03:00.980> than<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> spell

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
magic regenerates faster than the spell

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.410 
magic regenerates faster than the spell
drains<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.049> can<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.440> use<00:03:04.069> it<00:03:04.420> quite

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
drains it and you can just use it quite

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.270 
drains it and you can just use it quite
rapidly<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:08.480> won't<00:03:08.660> need<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.810> bedroll<00:03:12.280> so

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
rapidly and you won't need a bedroll so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640 
rapidly and you won't need a bedroll so
just<00:03:13.579> keep<00:03:13.760> that's<00:03:14.750> all<00:03:14.930> there<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.350> this

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
just keep that's all there is to this

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.080 
just keep that's all there is to this
really<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:18.130> raise<00:03:19.130> your<00:03:19.310> intelligence<00:03:19.910> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
really and raise your intelligence and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.670 
really and raise your intelligence and
that<00:03:20.239> will<00:03:20.359> help<00:03:20.510> your<00:03:20.660> magic<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.079> regenerate
