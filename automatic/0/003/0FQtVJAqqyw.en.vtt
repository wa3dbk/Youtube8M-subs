00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.910
 my name is Raniero Ballion and I'm a technician 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:13.299
 in preventive conservation and I take care of 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.370
 what is the arrival and departure of 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.189
 works of art from the Andalusian institute 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.630
 handling history equity 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.640
 normally one of the most operations 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 dangerous in quotes because you can 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.750
 cause damage if it is not correctly 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.440
 executed for that normally 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 We have manipulators with 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.620
 restorers with conservatives who 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.350
 together we all prepare these 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.900
 operations that are fundamental to 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.620
 the life of the work at the time 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.370
 we have it ready that's over 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.270
 the intervention operation 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.030
 the preparation process so that the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.420
 work return to the origin site is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 prepare it by wrapping it in a paper of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.000
 silk normally so that the surface 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.210
 of the polychromy does not suffer damages 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.450
 comes wrapped a second time with another 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.060
 slightly thicker paper type with a 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.910
 system of perforations that allow a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 exchange of the work with the environment 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.479
 where will it be and once prepared 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 then it is placed in the box 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.170
 the box are usually prepared are 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 pine wood boxes of flanders 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.890
 They have a thickness between 20 and 30 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 millimeters varnished with varnishes and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.660
 juices and waterproofed the interior 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.490
 It is lined with different foams 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.160
 densities to cushion the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.640
 vibrations and the possible blows that 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.119
 can receive the packaging once the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.580
 work is adjusted in the interior 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.190
 of the box is closed with a lid that goes 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.850
 no pressure but in such a way 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.590
 so that the work does not move 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.819
 blocked with different types of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.359
 closures 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.790
 and we move it to the media 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.579
 of transports and inside comes 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.099
 blocked so that the box does not have 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.340
 Rare movements or that may suffer the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.750
 work a few shock that are not the most 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.360
 suitable 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.450
 once we arrive at your location 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.210
 Original box does not open so 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.600
 immediate normally we wait between 1 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.200
 and 2 days for the boxes to go 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.330
 acclimating to the new situation that 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.120
 it's been a long time since 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.040
 they were at the time of returning there 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 leave it 1 a day or two so that 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.689
 return to a climate 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.689
 to the climate to which they were accustomed
