passwords access protected files and do

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
passwords access protected files and do
just<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:42.720> anything<00:01:43.049> else<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> leave

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
just about anything else and leave

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
just about anything else and leave
without<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> trace<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:46.079> only<00:01:46.409> fairly<00:01:46.860> big

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
without a trace the only fairly big

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.639 
without a trace the only fairly big
drawback<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:50.729> says<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> only<00:01:52.020> fairly

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
drawback is that says the only fairly

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.469 
drawback is that says the only fairly
big<00:01:52.829> drawback<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> hack<00:01:53.670> however<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
big drawback to the hack however and the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.209 
big drawback to the hack however and the
upside<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.020> most<00:01:55.229> users<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> can't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
upside for most users is that it can't

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.219 
upside for most users is that it can't
be<00:01:56.340> performed<00:01:56.700> remotely<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> be

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
be performed remotely so you have to be

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.170 
be performed remotely so you have to be
sitting<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.770> front<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> computer<00:01:59.280> but

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
sitting in front of the computer but

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020 
sitting in front of the computer but
that<00:02:00.450> has<00:02:00.719> nothing<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> point

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that has nothing to do with the point

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.320 
that has nothing to do with the point
