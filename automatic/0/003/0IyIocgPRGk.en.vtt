this<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.780> Liana<00:00:01.110> computer<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.010> that's<00:00:02.190> been

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
this is Liana computer and that's been

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.269 
this is Liana computer and that's been
working<00:00:02.520> since<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.449> quite<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> big<00:00:04.529> parcel<00:00:04.770> here

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
working since a quite a big parcel here

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.589 
working since a quite a big parcel here
will<00:00:06.270> open<00:00:06.540> up<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.080> I'll<00:00:07.770> see<00:00:07.980> what's<00:00:08.160> inside

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.370 

remember<00:00:12.599> II<00:00:13.519> think<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.000> obsessed

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.220 

American<00:00:19.380> accent<00:00:19.800> comes<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.550> box

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
American accent comes in up here box

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.990 
American accent comes in up here box
there<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.350> go

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
there we go

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.429 
there we go
nice<00:00:24.000> hat<00:00:24.300> TomTom<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> symbol<00:00:26.849> huh

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.520 

so<00:00:33.400> TomTom<00:00:34.030> sat-nav<00:00:34.450> system<00:00:34.989> yeah<00:00:35.260> you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
so TomTom sat-nav system yeah you

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.890 
so TomTom sat-nav system yeah you
connected<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.310> there<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.970> know<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:37.630> might<00:00:37.870> not

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
connected in there I know you might not

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.770 
connected in there I know you might not
be<00:00:38.140> able<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.350> see<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.620> over<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.910> movie<00:00:40.480> but<00:00:40.720> the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
be able to see it over the movie but the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.799 
be able to see it over the movie but the
pins<00:00:41.700> inside<00:00:42.700> that<00:00:42.970> connect<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.390> little<00:00:43.690> bit

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
pins inside that connect a little bit

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.260 
pins inside that connect a little bit
sort<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.050> banding<00:00:44.410> damaged<00:00:44.830> so<00:00:45.760> why<00:00:46.059> think

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
sort of banding damaged so why think

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.380 
sort of banding damaged so why think
we're<00:00:46.360> going<00:00:46.450> to<00:00:46.510> take<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:48.360> connector<00:00:49.360> out

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
we're going to take this connector out

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.119 
we're going to take this connector out
and<00:00:49.690> put<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.989> new<00:00:50.019> one<00:00:50.320> in<00:00:50.350> right<00:00:50.860> so<00:00:51.040> this

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
and put the new one in right so this

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.340 
and put the new one in right so this
Sutton<00:00:51.519> I'm<00:00:51.610> system<00:00:52.030> I'm<00:00:52.120> just<00:00:52.300> going<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.600> try

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
Sutton I'm system I'm just going to try

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.850 
Sutton I'm system I'm just going to try
to<00:00:53.739> switch<00:00:54.070> your<00:00:54.280> turn<00:00:55.080> sequel<00:00:56.080> Gary<00:00:56.260> action

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
to switch your turn sequel Gary action

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.710 
to switch your turn sequel Gary action
doesn't<00:00:57.790> look<00:00:58.090> like<00:00:58.300> it<00:01:00.300> okay<00:01:01.300> I<00:01:01.330> guess<00:01:01.540> that's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
doesn't look like it okay I guess that's

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.210 
doesn't look like it okay I guess that's
because<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.080> battery's<00:01:02.410> going<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.650> be<00:01:02.739> flat

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
because the battery's going to be flat

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.340 
because the battery's going to be flat
so<00:01:04.089> what<00:01:04.509> we're<00:01:04.600> going<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.750> do<00:01:04.839> we're<00:01:05.020> going<00:01:05.050> to

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
so what we're going to do we're going to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
so what we're going to do we're going to
open<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.740> up<00:01:05.920> now<00:01:07.140> hopefully<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.229> can<00:01:08.380> see<00:01:08.649> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
open it up now hopefully you can see I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
open it up now hopefully you can see I
connect<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.210> bit<00:01:10.600> clearer<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.780> pins

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
connect a bit clearer but so the pins

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.980 
connect a bit clearer but so the pins
there<00:01:14.320> should<00:01:14.560> all<00:01:14.680> be<00:01:14.890> level<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.990> instead

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
there should all be level and instead

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.460 
there should all be level and instead
they're<00:01:17.410> a<00:01:17.590> bit<00:01:18.160> up<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.430> down<00:01:18.550> so<00:01:19.470> what's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
they're a bit up and down so what's

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.380 
they're a bit up and down so what's
going<00:01:20.710> on<00:01:20.740> there<00:01:20.979> obviously<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.970> just<00:01:22.060> wear

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
going on there obviously it's just wear

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.749 
going on there obviously it's just wear
and<00:01:22.570> tear<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.840> think<00:01:23.310> there's<00:01:24.310> got<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
and tear I think there's got to the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.630 
and tear I think there's got to the
connections<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.660> pins<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:27.190> it's<00:01:27.399> time

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
connections and the pins and it's time

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.570 
connections and the pins and it's time
to<00:01:27.910> replace<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:29.160> connector<00:01:30.160> so<00:01:30.190> I'm<00:01:30.369> going<00:01:30.550> to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
to replace the connector so I'm going to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.279 
to replace the connector so I'm going to
get<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.729> buck<00:01:30.940> off<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:31.780> we'll<00:01:31.930> see<00:01:32.080> what<00:01:32.200> we

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
get a buck off and we'll see what we

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.990 
get a buck off and we'll see what we
need<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:32.619> right<00:01:32.649> over<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.039> first<00:01:33.220> part<00:01:33.490> of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
need to do right over the first part of

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.529 
need to do right over the first part of
their<00:01:34.330> disassembly<00:01:35.110> here<00:01:35.320> it's<00:01:35.590> pretty<00:01:36.369> much

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
their disassembly here it's pretty much

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.809 
their disassembly here it's pretty much
taking<00:01:37.539> out<00:01:37.660> two<00:01:38.050> screws<00:01:38.920> from<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.250> top<00:01:39.369> of

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
taking out two screws from the top of

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.889 
taking out two screws from the top of
the<00:01:39.910> back<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.929> all<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:43.179> sort<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.569> gently

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
the back and all this is sort of gently

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.279 
the back and all this is sort of gently
lifted<00:01:44.590> out<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.390> cable<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:49.289> screen

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
lifted out and the cable for the screen

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.779 
lifted out and the cable for the screen
the<00:01:50.440> white<00:01:50.590> cable<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.789> here<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:53.789> unclipped

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
the white cable just here is unclipped

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.120 
the white cable just here is unclipped
from<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.300> mainboard<00:01:55.840> here<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:56.679> this<00:01:56.890> is

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
from the mainboard here now this is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.650 
from the mainboard here now this is
screwed<00:01:57.729> in<00:01:58.289> with<00:01:59.289> how<00:02:00.099> many<00:02:00.280> four<00:02:00.610> screws<00:02:01.030> I'm

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
screwed in with how many four screws I'm

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.790 
screwed in with how many four screws I'm
just<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:01.959> to<00:02:02.020> take<00:02:02.140> all<00:02:02.289> those<00:02:02.440> four<00:02:02.679> screws

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
just going to take all those four screws

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.229 
just going to take all those four screws
out<00:02:03.190> then<00:02:03.399> I'll<00:02:03.550> be<00:02:03.700> able<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.910> get<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
out then I'll be able to get the

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.809 
out then I'll be able to get the
mainboard<00:02:04.840> out<00:02:05.190> then<00:02:06.190> I'll<00:02:06.310> be<00:02:06.459> able<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.700> look

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
mainboard out then I'll be able to look

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.010 
mainboard out then I'll be able to look
at<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.060> connector<00:02:07.450> that's<00:02:07.569> on<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.869> other

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
at the connector that's on the other

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.350 
at the connector that's on the other
side<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:09.099> see<00:02:09.729> how<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.239> go

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
side of it to see how to get that go

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.830 
side of it to see how to get that go
here's<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:11.459> main<00:02:12.459> board<00:02:12.790> itself<00:02:13.270> with<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
here's the main board itself with the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.210 
here's the main board itself with the
connector<00:02:14.349> that<00:02:14.380> we're<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:14.860> taking

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
connector that we're going to be taking

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.699 
connector that we're going to be taking
up<00:02:15.340> now<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.209> soldered<00:02:16.690> down<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:17.140> these<00:02:17.380> four

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
up now I soldered down just these four

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.650 
up now I soldered down just these four
sided<00:02:18.010> joints<00:02:18.459> there<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.030> then<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.420> five

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
sided joints there and then the five

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.350 
sided joints there and then the five
pins<00:02:20.020> at<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> back<00:02:21.130> will<00:02:21.370> d<00:02:21.520> solder<00:02:21.940> those<00:02:22.090> not

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
pins at the back will d solder those not

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
pins at the back will d solder those not
come<00:02:22.540> off<00:02:22.630> nice<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:22.900> easy<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:24.010> all<00:02:24.250> that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
come off nice and easy that's all that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.970 
come off nice and easy that's all that
needs<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.700> done<00:02:24.940> too

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
needs to be done too

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.280 
needs to be done too
get<00:02:26.250> rid<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.550> damage<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> inside<00:02:27.840> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
get rid of the damage on the inside of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.140 
get rid of the damage on the inside of
that<00:02:28.319> we'll<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> new<00:02:29.220> connector<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
that we'll put a new connector on and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
that we'll put a new connector on and
then<00:02:31.050> I'll<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.349> about<00:02:31.530> two<00:02:31.709> rather<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.220> we

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
then I'll be about two rather here we

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.309 
then I'll be about two rather here we
are<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.209> new<00:02:33.360> connector<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.170> can

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
are with the new connector as you can

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.080 
are with the new connector as you can
see<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.640> shape<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.020> can<00:02:37.230> see<00:02:37.470> that

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
see the shape of it you can see that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.320 
see the shape of it you can see that
hopefully<00:02:39.090> account<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.540> exactly<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> same

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
hopefully account is exactly the same

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.620 
hopefully account is exactly the same
there<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.450> go<00:02:43.100> okay<00:02:44.100> as<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.270> that's<00:02:45.480> on

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
there we go okay as the one that's on

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.030 
there we go okay as the one that's on
now<00:02:47.690> now<00:02:48.690> really<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.730> important<00:02:50.730> thing<00:02:51.060> on

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
now now really the important thing on

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.220 
now now really the important thing on
this<00:02:53.040> series<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.330> TomTom<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> go<00:02:54.959> five

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this series of the TomTom the go five

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.840 
this series of the TomTom the go five
20s<00:02:56.120> 7<00:02:57.120> 20s<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:58.019> 920's<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.250> as<00:02:59.370> well<00:02:59.580> is

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
20s 7 20s in 920's I think as well is

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.440 
20s 7 20s in 920's I think as well is
the<00:03:00.720> connectors<00:03:01.140> are<00:03:01.290> quite<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> bit<00:03:01.680> smaller

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the connectors are quite a bit smaller

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.870 
the connectors are quite a bit smaller
then<00:03:03.450> others<00:03:04.290> remember<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.620> later<00:03:04.880> series

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
then others remember the later series

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.210 
then others remember the later series
and<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> space<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.989> between<00:03:07.110> these<00:03:07.530> feet<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and the space in between these feet is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.910 
and the space in between these feet is
what's<00:03:08.970> more<00:03:09.180> important<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.769> see

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
what's more important as you can see

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.000 
what's more important as you can see
it's<00:03:11.100> exactly<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.670> same<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.390> each<00:03:13.380> connector

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
it's exactly the same on each connector

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.809 
it's exactly the same on each connector
a<00:03:14.910> different<00:03:15.540> series<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.549> TomTom<00:03:17.549> sat-nav

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
a different series of TomTom sat-nav

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.380 
a different series of TomTom sat-nav
system<00:03:18.980> different<00:03:19.980> connectors<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.850> more

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
system different connectors on the more

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.140 
system different connectors on the more
modern<00:03:21.780> ones<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:22.650> as<00:03:23.370> far<00:03:23.640> as<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
modern ones I think as far as I know the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.340 
modern ones I think as far as I know the
space<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.690> between<00:03:24.840> these<00:03:25.290> feet<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.959> bigger<00:03:27.959> so

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
space in between these feet is bigger so

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.240 
space in between these feet is bigger so
it<00:03:28.950> makes<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> overall<00:03:29.700> length<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
it makes the overall length of the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.550 
it makes the overall length of the
connector<00:03:32.250> longer<00:03:32.609> but<00:03:33.420> yeah<00:03:34.079> these<00:03:34.260> are

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
connector longer but yeah these are

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.460 
connector longer but yeah these are
quite<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.609> bit<00:03:35.700> more<00:03:36.000> rare<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.200> actual

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
quite a bit more rare the actual

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.319 
quite a bit more rare the actual
connections<00:03:37.950> myself<00:03:38.310> for<00:03:38.519> thought<00:03:38.880> unit<00:03:39.180> to

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
connections myself for thought unit to

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.509 
connections myself for thought unit to
be<00:03:40.019> able<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.410> hold<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.709> them<00:03:40.859> so<00:03:41.070> we<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.340> do

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
be able to get hold of them so we can do

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.690 
be able to get hold of them so we can do
this<00:03:41.700> repairs<00:03:42.090> but<00:03:42.840> anyway<00:03:43.590> those<00:03:44.040> five<00:03:44.400> pins

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
this repairs but anyway those five pins

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.210 
this repairs but anyway those five pins
on<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.910> back<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.920> turn<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.070> around

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
on the back of this turn that around

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.560 
on the back of this turn that around
like<00:03:48.350> over<00:03:49.350> got<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.530> five<00:03:49.709> pins<00:03:49.980> there

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
like over got the five pins there

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.170 
like over got the five pins there
there's<00:03:51.570> five<00:03:51.780> pins<00:03:52.109> there<00:03:52.620> as<00:03:52.769> well<00:03:53.180> it's

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
there's five pins there as well it's

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.640 
there's five pins there as well it's
what<00:03:54.329> we're<00:03:54.420> going<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.570> do<00:03:54.690> now<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:54.959> D<00:03:55.140> solder

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
what we're going to do now is D solder

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.770 
what we're going to do now is D solder
this<00:03:55.799> connector<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.579> solve<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.359> okay<00:03:57.540> we've

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
this connector and solve this okay we've

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.410 
this connector and solve this okay we've
got<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.170> new<00:03:58.769> connector<00:03:59.310> sold<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.820> into<00:04:00.060> place

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
got the new connector sold it into place

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.140 
got the new connector sold it into place
with<00:04:00.780> its<00:04:01.680> four<00:04:01.980> feet<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.459> got<00:04:02.670> two<00:04:02.820> on<00:04:02.970> this

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
with its four feet so I got two on this

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.940 
with its four feet so I got two on this
side<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.380> side<00:04:04.680> oh<00:04:05.000> good<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.030> can

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
side and so on this side oh good I can

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.330 
side and so on this side oh good I can
pick<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.610> whole<00:04:07.760> thing<00:04:07.790> up<00:04:09.220> from<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
pick the whole thing up from the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.870 
pick the whole thing up from the
connector<00:04:10.840> next<00:04:11.840> we<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.709> get<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.459> five

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
connector next we will get the five

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.760 
connector next we will get the five
electrical<00:04:14.540> contacts<00:04:14.959> on<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.230> boat<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.590> here

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
electrical contacts on the boat and here

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.610 
electrical contacts on the boat and here
we<00:04:15.920> are<00:04:15.950> with<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.970> old<00:04:17.420> connector<00:04:18.260> removed

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
we are with the old connector removed

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.890 
we are with the old connector removed
and<00:04:21.620> here<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:21.980> is<00:04:22.100> like<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:22.610> we<00:04:22.730> just<00:04:22.880> had<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.060> ID

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and here it is like so we just had to ID

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.659 
and here it is like so we just had to ID
solder<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:26.030> then<00:04:26.480> sort<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.350> came<00:04:27.560> off<00:04:27.669> one

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
solder it and then sort of came off one

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.980 
solder it and then sort of came off one
leg<00:04:28.910> by<00:04:29.419> one<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.610> then<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:32.000> contacts<00:04:32.840> on
