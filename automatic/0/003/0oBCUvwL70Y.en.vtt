it<00:02:47.370> got<00:02:48.370> one<00:02:48.549> other<00:02:48.700> thing<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.840> if<00:02:49.930> we

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
it got one other thing to do but if we

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.920 
it got one other thing to do but if we
look<00:02:50.049> in<00:02:50.290> our<00:02:50.410> alpha<00:02:50.769> channel<00:02:51.930> getting

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
look in our alpha channel getting

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.789 
look in our alpha channel getting
something<00:02:53.170> there<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.120> go<00:02:55.120> back<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.390> RGB<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:56.650> go

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
something there and go back to RGB we go

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.670 
something there and go back to RGB we go
