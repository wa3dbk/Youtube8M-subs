but no seriously the hitbox is when
you're<00:01:51.670> sniping<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.500> large<00:01:53.860> because<00:01:54.820> of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
you're sniping are so large because of

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
you're sniping are so large because of
lag<00:01:55.360> or<00:01:55.600> no<00:01:55.780> lag<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.840> just<00:01:59.050> don't

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
lag or no lag like you just don't

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.820 
lag or no lag like you just don't
understand<00:01:59.800> how<00:02:00.250> much<00:02:00.700> lag<00:02:01.300> affects<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.440> sniper

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
understand how much lag affects a sniper

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.860 
understand how much lag affects a sniper
because<00:02:03.159> it's<00:02:03.310> virtually<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> one-shot<00:02:04.540> kill

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
because it's virtually a one-shot kill

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.960 
because it's virtually a one-shot kill
so<00:02:05.470> when<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.250> connection<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:06.909> your

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
so when you have the connection on your

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.779 
so when you have the connection on your
side<00:02:07.510> you<00:02:07.840> are<00:02:08.440> seeing<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:09.009> enemy<00:02:09.399> before

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
side you are seeing the enemy before

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.030 
side you are seeing the enemy before
they<00:02:09.970> see<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.569> even<00:02:10.810> if<00:02:11.019> your<00:02:11.200> rush<00:02:11.530> sniping

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
they see you even if your rush sniping

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.130 
they see you even if your rush sniping
which<00:02:12.700> I've<00:02:12.879> deemed<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.330> another<00:02:13.599> video<00:02:13.780> of
