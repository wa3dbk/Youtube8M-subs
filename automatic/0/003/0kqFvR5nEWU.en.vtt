00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello friends Tijuana weekend we 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.160
 we found to one side of the auditorium 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
 municipal gutierrez 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 this time we will visit the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.870
 Pedro box gym facilities 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.870
 mor치n come with us 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 for 21 years this place has been the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.500
 second house of many recognized 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.719
 Boxers from the region the coach 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 Pedro Mor치n has dedicated his life to forging 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.100
 talented young people like liborio romero 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 who participated in the Olympic Games of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.519
 sydney-2000 in addition to having the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 presence of professional boxers 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.390
 as crist칩bal cruz luis arceo and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.850
 fernando several 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.850
 discipline boxing is pretty tough 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.470
 because a young man can start 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.449
 learn very well from 10 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.210
 years because he is already a young man who decides in 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.120
 as to what he wants in the second 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.610
 his training is mature fast because 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.799
 Here is a responsibility 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.060
 apart from being a taste then it starts 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.700
 to take a seriousness in sports and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.130
 loses his childhood begins to be mature 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.380
 fast you have to get up all the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.049
 days to run they have to look for the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.509
 fashion and parent support 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.300
 if they are very young every day half 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.950
 hour later they have to go to school 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.870
 then they have to go to school to 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.210
 eat something overtake tasks and come to 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.620
 train after training they have to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.920
 go on with homework and sleep 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.980
 that is a routine that will be from the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.560
 10 years at 18 then it is not 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.490
 easy to live they live a very different life 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.000
 not a normal life a very hard life in 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.800
 where 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.120
 from age 15 and started a 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.530
 very difficult stage for us as 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.600
 coaches because many talents are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.140
 they go because they start to know what is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.909
 a girlfriend 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.320
 maybe sometimes the greatest intention of 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.729
 parents as to tell them how 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.130
 they must bear those 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.720
 relationships then very few is a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.820
 lattice boxing valid for 15 years 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.460
 because with very few last and those that 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.220
 they stay if they do something in this gym 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.380
 train a total of 50 people between 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.860
 which 2 percent belong to the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.080
 female and the remaining male 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.480
 however only 30 percent are 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 competitors and the rest take it for 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.790
 learn defense techniques people 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.000
 nowadays it is proven that the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.210
 women also enjoy this discipline 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.770
 worldwide, however, not all 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.660
 encourage to practice it because of the fear of 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.210
 suffer changes in the body since the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.250
 training is very rigorous there are many 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.100
 women do not call them attention because 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.720
 you do a sport as very for 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.600
 men and I really say that it does not matter 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.670
 the sport that one can grasp is 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.490
 simply that he likes it because the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.840
 truth and people that women do not 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.810
 they like it because they say that they are going to be 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.920
 the body like as fighters that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.080
 not really 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.610
 depends on the person while 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.430
 Fernando Vargas tells us about 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.010
 sacrifice that makes a boxer and his 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.250
 first experience in boxing this is 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.600
 very difficult this everything to let out 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.620
 with friends this 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.500
 in food this is very tedious very 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.970
 jealous is all this this sport the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.900
 the first time I voted I was very afraid 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.840
 She was shaky and she did not know what 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.300
 it was that and one day I got there they got me 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.490
 going to go up will flip and come up with 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.380
 fear and they serve hit the truth 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.890
 They did hit me because I'm not like 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.140
 many what I already knew and this one hit me 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.990
 but jay from those blows I'm 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.000
 learning and so the coach tells me 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.569
 of box Pedro Mor치n said goodbye with this 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.730
 message addressed to all young people 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.579
 and I've always said youth is 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.489
 to work youth is a cycle 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.989
 very small you have to take advantage of it 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.199
 old age is to enjoy and for the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.639
 I remember then, if they are going to do 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:32.270
 something that they do well and that they leave behind 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.130
 what are drugs what are excesses 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.490
 so they can have a long life 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.570
 and can develop something nice 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.479
 currently the state of baja california 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.370
 is number one in terms of boxing without 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.870
 However, it is necessary that the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.180
 support from the Municipal Institute 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.910
 sport to improve 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:56.270
 facilities and buy sports equipment 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.270
 and thus boost Tijuana talent
