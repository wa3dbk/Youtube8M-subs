not all of them have a zip code but up

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.340 
not all of them have a zip code but up
here<00:01:43.830> there<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.039> zip<00:01:45.310> code<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.229> what

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
here there is a zip code for it so what

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.440 
here there is a zip code for it so what
we're<00:01:47.530> going<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:48.070> do<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.580> we<00:01:48.880> are<00:01:48.909> going<00:01:49.060> to

we're going to do is we are going to
give<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.780> zip<00:01:49.960> code<00:01:50.140> by<00:01:50.380> selecting<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.659> it'll

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
give it a zip code by selecting it it'll

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.800 
give it a zip code by selecting it it'll
bring<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.990> together<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.850> other<00:01:55.000> side<00:01:55.539> you

down here is where we're going to type
in<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.399> zip<00:02:00.429> code<00:02:00.610> which<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:03.390> 1523<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:06.420> with

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
in the zip code which is 1523 and with

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.250 
in the zip code which is 1523 and with
that<00:02:07.630> done<00:02:07.869> we<00:02:08.080> are<00:02:08.110> going<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:10.950> hit<00:02:11.950> tab<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
that done we are going to hit tab and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.590 
that done we are going to hit tab and
over<00:02:14.739> here<00:02:14.950> they<00:02:15.130> tell<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.579> a<00:02:15.610> score<00:02:16.209> which<00:02:16.480> is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
over here they tell you a score which is

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.150 
over here they tell you a score which is
pretty<00:02:16.750> much<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.989> percentage<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.980> it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
pretty much a percentage that it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.479 
pretty much a percentage that it's
correct<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:20.260> want<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.709> that's<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.980> hundred

correct we want the one that's a hundred

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.620 
correct we want the one that's a hundred
so<00:02:21.940> once<00:02:22.510> that's<00:02:22.720> done<00:02:23.280> make<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> note<00:02:24.549> up<00:02:24.790> here

u2 anem you is unmatched and just to
make<00:02:55.600> things<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:56.020> little<00:02:56.110> easier<00:02:56.320> we're<00:02:57.220> going

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
make things a little easier we're going

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.040 
make things a little easier we're going
to<00:02:57.370> go<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.580> all<00:02:57.880> addresses<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.690> we're<00:02:58.810> just

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
to go to all addresses and we're just

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.430 
to go to all addresses and we're just
going<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.350> dealing<00:02:59.470> with<00:03:00.870> unmatched<00:03:01.870> it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
going to be dealing with unmatched it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.730 
going to be dealing with unmatched it
got<00:03:02.620> rid<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.800> all<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.100> ones<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.430> are<00:03:03.640> matched

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
got rid of all the ones that are matched

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.330 
got rid of all the ones that are matched
so<00:03:07.020> there's<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.110> your<00:03:08.530> turn<00:03:08.800> where<00:03:09.070> they<00:03:09.160> want

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
so there's a your turn where they want

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.520 
so there's a your turn where they want
you<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.550> find<00:03:09.790> another<00:03:10.150> through<00:03:10.870> another

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
you to find another through another

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.130 
you to find another through another
address<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:13.030> has<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.240> hyphen<00:03:13.840> when<00:03:14.020> it

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
address that has a hyphen when it

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.670 
address that has a hyphen when it
shouldn't<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:15.130> just<00:03:15.400> go<00:03:15.520> ahead<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.820> do<00:03:16.090> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.380 

okay<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.520> what<00:03:24.820> we're<00:03:24.970> going<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.270> do

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.860 
is we're going to right click on object
ID<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.600> we're<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.110> use<00:03:29.410> ascending<00:03:33.870> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
ID and we're going to use ascending and

can see there is no street or
intersection<00:03:59.190> for<00:03:59.340> it<00:04:02.090> but<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.150> does<00:04:03.300> give<00:04:03.510> us

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
intersection for it but it does give us

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.610 
intersection for it but it does give us
the<00:04:03.720> zip<00:04:03.900> code<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:08.690> what<00:04:09.690> they<00:04:09.840> want<00:04:09.990> us<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.260> do

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the zip code and what they want us to do

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.090 
the zip code and what they want us to do
is<00:04:12.380> they<00:04:13.380> tell<00:04:13.650> us<00:04:13.830> that<00:04:15.709> there<00:04:16.709> was<00:04:16.890> something

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
is they tell us that there was something

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.530 
is they tell us that there was something
attached<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.420> or<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> survey<00:04:19.470> that

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
attached to this or a survey that

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
attached to this or a survey that
mentioned<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.810> attendee<00:04:22.200> lived<00:04:22.410> on

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
mentioned that the attendee lived on

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.210 
mentioned that the attendee lived on
candid<00:04:23.130> away<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:25.110> what<00:04:25.380> we're<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.920> do<00:04:26.070> is

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
candid away so what we're going to do is

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.810 
candid away so what we're going to do is
we're<00:04:26.400> going<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.580> minimize<00:04:27.000> this<00:04:28.520> this<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.670> if

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
we're going to minimize this this is if

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.550 
we're going to minimize this this is if
you<00:04:29.940> have<00:04:29.970> outside<00:04:30.510> information<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.560> what

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
you have outside information and what

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.230 
you have outside information and what
we're<00:04:34.680> going<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.980> do<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.340> they<00:04:35.850> want<00:04:36.060> us<00:04:36.120> to

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
we're going to do is they want us to

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.500 
we're going to do is they want us to
zoom<00:04:36.390> into<00:04:36.570> this<00:04:36.750> area<00:04:36.960> right<00:04:37.230> here<00:04:37.290> and

and then they have em nap it went from
you<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.900> an<00:05:36.990> M<00:05:37.140> so<00:05:37.470> it's<00:05:37.800> matched<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:39.500> that's

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
you to an M so it's matched and that's

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.650 
you to an M so it's matched and that's
it<00:05:40.800> for<00:05:41.040> this<00:05:41.130> tutorial<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.970> as<00:05:42.450> you<00:05:42.540> can<00:05:42.630> see

it for this tutorial and as you can see

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.870 
it for this tutorial and as you can see
the<00:05:42.870> match<00:05:43.020> number<00:05:43.470> up<00:05:43.590> here<00:05:43.620> went<00:05:43.950> up<00:05:44.070> one<00:05:44.700> as

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
the match number up here went up one as

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.770 
the match number up here went up one as
well<00:05:45.260> that's<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.380> for<00:05:46.530> this<00:05:46.620> tutorial
