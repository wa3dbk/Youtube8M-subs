metal<00:00:33.829> if<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.010> look<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.910> pedal<00:00:37.460> it's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
metal if we look at the the pedal it's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.819 
metal if we look at the the pedal it's
pretty<00:00:38.910> straightforward<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.320> have

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
pretty straightforward actually you have

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.100 
pretty straightforward actually you have
a<00:00:40.890> shared<00:00:41.190> tone<00:00:41.520> control<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
a shared tone control so that's like a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.610 
a shared tone control so that's like a
basement<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> treble<00:00:44.360> for<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.690> find

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
basement and a treble for you to find

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.450 
basement and a treble for you to find
you<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:46.890> own<00:00:47.100> sound<00:00:47.960> clean<00:00:48.960> volume

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
overdrive gain control and an overdrive

clean<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> overdrive<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
clean to overdrive and then you have a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.820 
clean to overdrive and then you have a
boost<00:01:00.840> function<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:03.439> that's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
boost function on there that's not it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.190 
boost function on there that's not it
because<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.330> smart<00:01:06.630> features

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
because there are some smart features

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.640 
because there are some smart features
built<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.619> these<00:01:07.830> pedals<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:09.150> well<00:01:09.650> for

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
built in these pedals as well for

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
built in these pedals as well for
instance<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.100> look<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.119> side<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
instance if we look at this side of the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.710 
instance if we look at this side of the
panel<00:01:12.990> del<00:01:13.979> you'll<00:01:14.159> find<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> bunch<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
panel del you'll find all a bunch of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.980 
panel del you'll find all a bunch of
connectors<00:01:16.909> if<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:18.689> they

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
connectors if you look at them then they

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.210 
connectors if you look at them then they
will<00:01:19.110> make<00:01:19.259> sense<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
will make sense to you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
will make sense to you
there's<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> -<00:01:21.869> effect<00:01:22.229> loops<00:01:22.439> built<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.950> a

pre effect open opposed to peg loop and
it<00:01:25.920> allows<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it allows you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.840 
it allows you

on this preamp in a pre loop we used

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.010 
on this preamp in a pre loop we used
more<00:01:40.530> boost<00:01:41.190> pedals<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.570> there<00:01:42.870> were

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
more boost pedals like and there were

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010 
more boost pedals like and there were
our<00:01:43.229> pedals<00:01:43.590> volume<00:01:44.040> pedals<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> stuff<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:45.900> a

this is the main deny volt input on the
other<00:02:06.479> side<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:06.990> find<00:02:07.140> guitar<00:02:08.009> inputs

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
other side you will find guitar inputs

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.780 
other side you will find guitar inputs
and<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.270> outputs<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> pedal<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.459> go

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and the outputs of the pedal you can go

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.650 
and the outputs of the pedal you can go
balanced<00:02:12.239> directly<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> mixer

use<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:17.140> recording<00:02:18.140> stuff<00:02:18.830> which<00:02:19.460> really

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
use it for recording stuff which really

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.660 
use it for recording stuff which really
works<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.180> well<00:02:20.950> monitor<00:02:21.950> output<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.520> an

works really well monitor output is an
unfiltered<00:02:23.180> signal<00:02:23.630> outputs<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.740> can

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
unfiltered signal outputs and you can

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.010 
unfiltered signal outputs and you can
set<00:02:25.930> actually<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.590> 3-way<00:02:28.130> switch<00:02:29.020> for
