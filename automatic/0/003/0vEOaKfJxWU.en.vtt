if you put in a memory card or a USB it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.999 
if you put in a memory card or a USB it
will<00:01:50.660> connect<00:01:51.170> straight<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.739> the<00:01:51.830> computer

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
will connect straight to the computer

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.740 
will connect straight to the computer
and<00:01:52.429> you'll<00:01:52.580> see<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.090> files<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.630> your

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
computer also for scanning you can scan

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.040 
computer also for scanning you can scan
to<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> memory<00:02:00.860> card<00:02:01.130> or<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:02.360> back<00:02:02.599> again<00:02:02.929> to

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
to a memory card or just back again to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.490 
to a memory card or just back again to
the<00:02:03.140> computer<00:02:06.130> also<00:02:07.130> what<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.429> like<00:02:07.640> about<00:02:07.759> this

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the computer also what I like about this

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:20.070 
the computer also what I like about this
is<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.950> go<00:02:10.160> over<00:02:10.190> here<00:02:10.399> back<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.000> Mac<00:02:16.480> and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.600 

it<00:02:21.080> comes<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.530> disc<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.250> works<00:02:22.400> for

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
it comes with a disc and it works for

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.300 
it comes with a disc and it works for
Mac<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.300> PC<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:26.200> over<00:02:27.200> here<00:02:27.500> check

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
Mac and or PC so that over here check

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.450 
Mac and or PC so that over here check
out<00:02:28.520> your<00:02:28.730> ink<00:02:28.940> with<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.870> utility<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:31.250> this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
out your ink with the utility then this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.950 
out your ink with the utility then this
is<00:02:31.550> probably<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.940> best<00:02:32.180> thing<00:02:32.360> ever

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
is probably the best thing ever

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.380 
is probably the best thing ever
here<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.830> center<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.370> lexmark<00:02:35.000> series

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
here at the center it's lexmark series

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.770 
here at the center it's lexmark series
center<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.640> cannot<00:02:43.970> scan<00:02:44.540> it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
center and with this you cannot scan it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.290 
center and with this you cannot scan it
like<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.460> probably<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> best<00:02:47.060> thing

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
like this is probably the best thing

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.320 
like this is probably the best thing
like<00:02:47.480> if<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.720> want<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.960> scan<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> black

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
like if you want to scan like a black

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:01.990 
like if you want to scan like a black
text<00:02:51.010> then<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.160> want<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:56.890> edit<00:02:57.890> it<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:01.820> could

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
text then you want to edit it you could

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.190 
text then you want to edit it you could
scan<00:03:02.300> whatever's<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.840> there<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.110> then
