00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.899
 and how are friends of creation your 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.029
 point with a welcome to this 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.520
 new tutorial this little tips of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.830
 4d cinema to laminate channel bonilla 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.140
 of graphs 4 and 3 of this small 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.849
 tips that I'll be talking about how 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.949
 create different districts this effect of 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.320
 text what is the cinema 4d we have 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.490
 here if we get a little closer what is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.560
 the text of very serious the text of nur 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.560
 west of extrusion and here we have 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.230
 also a text is enough 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.810
 different and new'm not really used to be 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.190
 called the text lining that later 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.470
 we will be talking here in what is the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.290
 tutorial on how to create what is the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.410
 text of linings giving the instruction and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.240
 a little modeling here in the program 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.370
 to appear as the two 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.620
 earlier than here and in this 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.330
 previous prize that says everything looks 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.310
 totally equal but each one has been 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.320
 created a different way and each one 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.690
 has a different function than what it is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.600
 the program so look here what 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.659
 new file 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.939
 to create what is this here this 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.400
 little effect I'll start with the 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.830
 dirt look at that move and here we see here 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.240
 what is the subject of text is this 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.600
 lack that is quite difficult because 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.149
 we will lose quite easy because already 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.090
 has what is the created text and is 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.850
 destroyed et cetera that only that 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 change here in an object I will be here 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.360
 we simply put the name that 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.440
 we want here also in tapas 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.060
 we can give what is here a bit of 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.110
 bevel to what is our job 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.600
 we can give it without caps step 5 and here 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.000
 this 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.130
 in the radio you can put more or less 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.829
 335 and 3 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.750
 in this way to make it quite 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.670
 well also with the object we can 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.890
 customize what is the source here if 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.510
 you have the version this 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.890
 r 11 or earlier then when takeoff 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.530
 this other part of here will open a 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.479
 window part but if you have the r3 it has 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.250
 prepared in the sign this I'm 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.680
 riding on screen 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.410
 here find a source that I like 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.660
 ours is called coulvert and here is more 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.209
 or less we already have the I would not see 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.580
 wrong here a little extrusion what is 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.370
 here in depth here we're going to see that 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.110
 in what is the very serious text we see 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.709
 that sees where the depth what 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.180
 is here arribita in each one is a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.530
 different part where we're going will be giving 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.200
 what is extrusion to what is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.300
 our our text that here already 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.019
 we have more or less created what is the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.260
 first it looks pretty good it's a style 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.060
 pretty simple as we do with what 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.350
 which is the second one we're going to put here in 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.980
 name 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.980
 reuters 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.829
 we do not do it here to what is this 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.560
 small window here and we're going to open 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.870
 what is the word that that text the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.489
 text tool let's learn to 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.379
 see that we see an explayan that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.689
 says text that we can edit it here 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.239
 says the text word we can 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:12.750
 write the name that we want 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.400
 and write this default here and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.439
 also for who says source we can 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.180
 customize what is the source to the 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.030
 that we have in Canada in this 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.230
 program will search here again for the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.230
 vertical cv 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.860
 more or less around here is 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.920
 let's say that the text was created but not 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.510
 It is extruded to the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.280
 destruction can not we here this 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.709
 small window and let's go to the one that is 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.640
 double extrusion which means we're going 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.110
 to be extruding a path that 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.599
 we can do but what is the text and 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.480
 let's take him to do it son of the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.790
 what is the light destruction I am like now 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.000
 has been created what is a path that 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.290
 lose me in an instruction what 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.430
 also as I said earlier in hbo 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.969
 text of this one 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.030
 to create what is this extrusion are 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.500
 different ways here we see that in the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.260
 mount ex shows up here 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.230
 depth here in extrusion appears 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.239
 here in motion in 20 centimeters 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.599
 place the 50 also 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.099
 we have to destroy it a bit 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.990
 also who is not doing it is not 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.870
 the same is with so much that little charm 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.610
 tied place the 5 in radio place the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.610
 3 and the same here below 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.040
 d 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.710
 in this way and we see that also 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.570
 we have created what is that text that 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.050
 also quite similar what is very 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.840
 serious because he does not know that a prior 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.690
 I think this text is also seen 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.180
 pretty good and quite similar the 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.940
 I remember that this also everyone has 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.669
 a specific function and as well 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.830
 I can use it for what you want ok can 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.110
 be already for this to simply create the 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.840
 effect also to give some effects 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.990
 specials here in what is the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.240
 text is flat does not have it and finished 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.460
 pleasing me has now let's 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.289
 create the third and the plus and minus 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.930
 lose me less used what is the 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.220
 program shows that what is the effect of 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.590
 spline 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.090
 pass through here and what good here 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.830
 let's do I'm going to write here what 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.320
 is the word write the report 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.780
 and what I will do here will be to change the 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.420
 source again to what is soccer 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.560
 ethics 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.750
 it's not only here 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.960
 and now what I will do is duplicate what 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.630
 is this this text that I will give control to 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.750
 control and look I want it is the faces 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.590
 and look here and what is superior and why 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.840
 here this text that duplicate that 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.830
 retarded is not taking a little towards 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.300
 back I'll take it back as much as 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.370
 I want it to be the extrusion more 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.860
 forward we are seeing how it is but 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.570
 is taking more or less here and there 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.060
 look what is in sight of 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.060
 perspective if we look here what 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.389
 our 3d environment we see that we have 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.250
 docs plane already created with what is of the 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.770
 word now let's go here what 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.680
 is this the lining light we are going to 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.479
 select those two spline texts 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.770
 and we are going to be the children of what is 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.810
 where it went beyond see what happens 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.000
 we see that that has created us what is 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.790
 this 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.960
 the layout of the instruction but you see 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:42.820
 a little bit this is a bit pixilated what 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.260
 is the extrusion and at the beginning you see that 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.820
 It's not very good but if we go here to 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.610
 the pagan properties of what is 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.070
 this the light of form was clarified to us that 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.520
 is object and here in mesh subdivision 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:58.190
 we are going to place more or less 300 ounces 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.030
 lens and let's see how it is changing what 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.100
 what is that source that lining light ok 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.140
 let's do the breasts again 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:11.169
 here to tapas cap with both lid with 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.169
 I sing and place the 5 already here 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.170
 this is part of creating the text with 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.570
 which is forum light is not well known 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.800
 why maybe in what is the tip we go 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.890
 to see here what is a render 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.170
 we quickly see that they are very similar 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.750
 each of the sources for each and 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:33.560
 created with a different tool ok 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:38.120
 let's give a little bit of color here 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:41.220
 what is font styles happens from 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.030
 here a bit of speculating 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.030
 more or less 

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:49.889
 what are the three of them and what do you put of that 

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:53.099
 way and forest look totally 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:55.739
 same but each one is created from a 

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:57.659
 different way ok many times when 

00:07:55.739 --> 00:08:01.409
 we simply do what the world is 

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:04.349
 text and what is of light destruction 

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:05.939
 for game and what is this light of 

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:08.129
 lining that I hope I liked this 

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.409
 type of cinema 4d table nor a ball 

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:12.449
 do not forget to visit creation your dotcom 

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:15.359
 and subscribe to what is this channel or 

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:17.779
 that we can not have next tip 19 4 of 

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:17.779
 r3
