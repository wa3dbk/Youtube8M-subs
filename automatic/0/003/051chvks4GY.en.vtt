now<00:03:13.600> looks<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:14.750> there's<00:03:14.960> already<00:03:15.770> break-in

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
now looks like there's already break-in

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.910 
now looks like there's already break-in
it<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.990> like<00:03:18.200> there's<00:03:18.440> some<00:03:18.590> bottom

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
it it's like there's some bottom

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.410 
it it's like there's some bottom
protection<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.520> deal<00:03:19.850> with<00:03:20.060> too<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:22.210> let's<00:03:23.210> see

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
protection to deal with too so let's see

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.190 
protection to deal with too so let's see
how<00:03:23.450> I'm<00:03:23.630> going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.810> do<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:26.709> there<00:03:27.709> we<00:03:27.890> go<00:03:29.200> so

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
how I'm going to do this there we go so

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.410 
how I'm going to do this there we go so
they're<00:03:30.580> already<00:03:31.580> got<00:03:31.760> fingerprints<00:03:32.209> on<00:03:32.300> the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
they're already got fingerprints on the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.900 
they're already got fingerprints on the
screen<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:32.840> we're<00:03:32.990> doing<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.910> probably

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910
