00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.509 
theta and the argument of Z is given by

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
theta so this is the key idea behind

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:04.740 
theta so this is the key idea behind
this<00:00:57.000> question

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.390 

let's<00:01:05.410> now<00:01:05.680> solve<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.310> problem

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.310 

Z<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.710> equal<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.740> minus<00:01:12.720> root<00:01:13.720> 3<00:01:14.110> plus<00:01:15.100> iota

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Z is equal to minus root 3 plus iota

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.410 
Z is equal to minus root 3 plus iota
let's<00:01:17.320> now<00:01:17.530> identify<00:01:18.340> what<00:01:18.550> is<00:01:18.700> X<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.090> what<00:01:19.270> is

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
let's now identify what is X and what is

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:30.120 
let's now identify what is X and what is
y<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.430> X<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:23.730> minus<00:01:24.730> root<00:01:25.000> 3<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:26.070> Y<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:28.050> 1<00:01:29.130> right

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
y now X is minus root 3 and Y is 1 right

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.180 
y now X is minus root 3 and Y is 1 right
so<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:31.480> modulus<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:32.230> Z<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.190> equal<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:35.190> under

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
so the modulus of Z is equal to under

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.550 
so the modulus of Z is equal to under
root<00:01:36.220> of<00:01:37.200> minus<00:01:38.200> root<00:01:38.500> 3<00:01:38.860> square<00:01:39.450> plus<00:01:40.560> 1

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
root of minus root 3 square plus 1

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.450 
root of minus root 3 square plus 1
square<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:43.180> is<00:01:43.390> equal<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.010> root<00:01:45.010> 4<00:01:45.430> which

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
square and it is equal to root 4 which

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.160 
square and it is equal to root 4 which
is<00:01:46.210> equal<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.810> 2<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.369> this<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.170> modulus

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
is equal to 2 so this is the modulus

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.660 
is equal to 2 so this is the modulus
offset<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:56.020> we<00:01:56.080> have<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.770> obtain<00:01:57.010> the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
offset now we have to obtain the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.060 
offset now we have to obtain the
argument<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.660> Z<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.320> we<00:01:59.650> have<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.950> obtain

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
argument of Z that is we have to obtain

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.880 
argument of Z that is we have to obtain
theta<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.420> let<00:02:01.570> us<00:02:01.600> first<00:02:01.900> plot<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.380> point

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
theta so let us first plot the point

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.800 
theta so let us first plot the point
minus<00:02:03.520> root<00:02:03.790> 3<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.360> 1<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.380> Ogden<00:02:05.800> plane<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
minus root 3 and 1 on the Ogden plane so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.960 
minus root 3 and 1 on the Ogden plane so
this<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> argan<00:02:08.679> plane<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.700> x

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
this is the argan plane and this is x

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.590 
this is the argan plane and this is x
axis<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.440> y<00:02:12.010> X<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.610> now<00:02:13.090> X<00:02:13.120> is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
axis and this one is y X is now X is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.290 
axis and this one is y X is now X is
equal<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.170> minus<00:02:14.590> root<00:02:14.800> 3<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.250> Y<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.610> equal<00:02:15.760> to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
equal to minus root 3 and Y is equal to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.680 
equal to minus root 3 and Y is equal to
1<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.260> point<00:02:17.680> lies<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.850> second

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
1 so this point lies in the second

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.710 
1 so this point lies in the second
quadrant<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.820> its<00:02:21.820> distance<00:02:22.330> from<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
quadrant and its distance from the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.890 
quadrant and its distance from the
origin<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.650> 2<00:02:24.190> because<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.940> modulus<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.600> 2

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.650 

so<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.190> need<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.730> obtain<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.450> value<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.280> theta

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so we need to obtain the value of theta

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.619 
so we need to obtain the value of theta
right<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.319> let<00:02:37.470> us<00:02:37.500> write<00:02:37.950> Z<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.300> polar

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
right so let us write Z in the polar

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.600 
right so let us write Z in the polar
form<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.860> R<00:02:41.069> cos<00:02:42.030> theta<00:02:42.260> plus<00:02:43.260> R<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.280> top

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
form and this R cos theta plus R you top

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.699 
form and this R cos theta plus R you top
R<00:02:44.849> sine<00:02:45.420> theta<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.879> r<00:02:47.879> is<00:02:48.480> 2<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.260> equal

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
R sine theta and r is 2 so this is equal

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.979 
R sine theta and r is 2 so this is equal
to<00:02:49.890> 2<00:02:50.220> cos<00:02:50.549> theta<00:02:51.239> plus<00:02:52.160> iota<00:02:53.330> 2<00:02:54.330> sine<00:02:54.750> theta

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
to 2 cos theta plus iota 2 sine theta

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.650 
to 2 cos theta plus iota 2 sine theta
and<00:02:56.780> Z<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:58.049> equal<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.799> minus<00:02:59.569> root<00:03:00.569> 3<00:03:00.959> plus<00:03:01.769> iota

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
and Z is equal to minus root 3 plus iota

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:12.710 
and Z is equal to minus root 3 plus iota
so<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.900> comparing<00:03:08.989> we<00:03:09.989> get<00:03:10.640> minus<00:03:11.640> root<00:03:12.030> 3<00:03:12.420> is

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so on comparing we get minus root 3 is

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.530 
so on comparing we get minus root 3 is
equal<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> 2<00:03:14.220> cos<00:03:14.579> theta<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.980> 1<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.280> equal<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.030> 2

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
equal to 2 cos theta and 1 is equal to 2

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.420 
equal to 2 cos theta and 1 is equal to 2
sine<00:03:18.900> theta<00:03:21.560> now<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.620> first<00:03:23.099> equation

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
sine theta now the first equation

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.390 
sine theta now the first equation
implies<00:03:24.200> cos<00:03:25.200> theta<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.220> equal<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:27.410> minus<00:03:28.410> root

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
implies cos theta is equal to minus root

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.690 
implies cos theta is equal to minus root
3<00:03:29.790> by<00:03:29.819> 2<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:31.790> sine<00:03:32.790> theta<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.930> equal<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:35.730> 1<00:03:36.389> by<00:03:36.660> 2

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.809 
3 by 2 and sine theta is equal to 1 by 2
now<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:39.120> know<00:03:39.359> that

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:55.229

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
sine PI by 6 is equal to 1 by 2 + cos PI

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:04.229 
sine PI by 6 is equal to 1 by 2 + cos PI
by<00:03:55.540> 6<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.290> equal<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.480> root<00:03:58.480> 3<00:03:58.900> by<00:03:59.109> 2<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:03.239> so

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
by 6 is equal to root 3 by 2 right so

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.520 
by 6 is equal to root 3 by 2 right so
cos<00:04:04.510> PI<00:04:04.810> by<00:04:05.019> 6<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.620> root<00:04:06.370> 3<00:04:06.670> by<00:04:06.879> 2<00:04:06.909> but<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:08.200> want

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
cos PI by 6 is root 3 by 2 but we want

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.119 
cos PI by 6 is root 3 by 2 but we want
to<00:04:08.769> have<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.250> value<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.790> theta<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.629> which<00:04:11.129> cos

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
to have the value of theta for which cos

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.750

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
theta is equal to minus root 3 by 2

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.860 
theta is equal to minus root 3 by 2
right<00:04:16.750> now<00:04:17.380> since<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.310> point<00:04:18.669> is<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.239> second

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
right now since this point is in second

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.540 
right now since this point is in second
quadrant<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.039> we<00:04:21.250> have<00:04:21.930> sine<00:04:24.660> PI<00:04:26.190> minus<00:04:27.190> PI<00:04:27.520> by

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
quadrant so we have sine PI minus PI by

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:37.050 
quadrant so we have sine PI minus PI by
6<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.539> equal<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:29.680> 1<00:04:29.919> by<00:04:30.160> 2<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:32.190> cos<00:04:34.080> PI<00:04:35.669> minus<00:04:36.669> PI

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
6 is equal to 1 by 2 and cos PI minus PI

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.480 
6 is equal to 1 by 2 and cos PI minus PI
by<00:04:37.090> 6<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:38.050> equal<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.630> minus<00:04:40.630> root<00:04:41.080> 3<00:04:41.500> by<00:04:41.530> 2<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
first equation implies sine 5 PI by 6 is

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.529 
first equation implies sine 5 PI by 6 is
equal<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:52.330> 1<00:04:52.690> by<00:04:52.930> 2<00:04:53.729> and<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:55.090> second<00:04:55.479> equation

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
equal to 1 by 2 and the second equation

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:03.120 
equal to 1 by 2 and the second equation
implies<00:04:56.789> cos<00:04:57.900> 5<00:04:58.900> PI<00:04:59.349> by<00:04:59.650> 6<00:05:00.130> is<00:05:00.430> equal<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:02.130> minus

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
implies cos 5 PI by 6 is equal to minus

implies cos 5 PI by 6 is equal to minus
root<00:05:03.520> 3<00:05:03.909> by<00:05:03.940> 2<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:05.020> means<00:05:05.320> theta<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:06.190> minus<00:05:06.699> 5

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
hence the modulus is 2 and the argument

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.770 
hence the modulus is 2 and the argument
