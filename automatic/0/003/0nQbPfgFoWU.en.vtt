00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 - no no no no it's ok 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 so 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.569
 if not 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:11.220
 Why 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.870
 replacing an innovation with another means of locomotion he must 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.270
 rest incredible secondary placement 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.199
 it's michel who told us michel 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.539
 I leave you this microphone what is this trash 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.519
 that you use dog it's a tricycle 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.349
 check because the year 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.350
 so to the giant and comfortable 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.630
 and fairy sayegh ochoa defeat the resistance of the air to what he likes 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.370
 so that's the main driver speed this 15 km we're in a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.000
 city ​​where there are bike paths not necessarily bike I enjoy it I am 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.900
 regularly 3000 km a year by bike 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.860
 professional field on a regular bike 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.530
 and there I said to myself that it will be interesting this machine 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.020
 and I confirm it's very interesting it's the foot so the principle is 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.980
 what do we do 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.900
 you have it in front of me and a pedalboard is pretty classic with three 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.570
 uplands 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.410
 but there is a chain so the ump so lespignan behind it's all to 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.660
 makes a bike equipment% 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.400
 the big point is that thanks to the sponsorship we are really going much 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.150
 quick to equal effort with a bike a facility to make a 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
 comparison between bike and goal hospitals 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.910
 alexandre gady people i can ride at 40 per hour 100% of his time at 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.130
 his little winger 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.790
 I you know I think the maximum speed reached on 200 meters 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 with a bike type tour de France it is about 80 kilometers 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.840
 they never see the same man these losses according to you put it 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.079
 in a gear like coal a little bit smaller at boty niger in your opinion 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.150
 how much commented 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.820
 I spent four years Texan 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.100
 again 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 so go quickly 130 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.249
 yeah okay carole it does not say it is it is not done these same 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.070
 with just the strength of the legs a human being so obviously conditions 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.930
 daddy are not in front of them 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.650
 in the fields your place without cheating without a car in front of him to make 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.750
 screen that kind of meters 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.240
 so I give you the keys to life-span performance related to a 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.050
 aerodynamic design for obviously the price paid what is 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.380
 makes a hundred forty pounds so if I want to ride there it goes bad 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.610
 Or are you going to find this man this machine I made 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.369
 by our Dutch friends 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.510
 so far we find ourselves on a site specializing in recumbent 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.549
 mobile bicycles 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.069
 So I am 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.419
 ecological approach you read 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.309
 and yes I'm sure anyway the bike I was I'm for 100% 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.279
 but 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.169
 for the pleasure I also have to say well and so how are you 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.069
 perceived by motorists drove with steinhoff 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.909
 first on earth the next days it was awesome elsewhere a 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.379
 police car that is the one that has been useful to the amateurs 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.779
 and who made me sign that 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.379
 Well, it's not every day that it happens so it left me a memory 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.599
 moved and nice then you obviously use I imagine that soon in 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.279
 little what we do not see the turmoil 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.879
 e departure either as much breaking rubbish as it is at its 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.899
 sixteenth no motorists friends 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.419
 I roll on joy the road 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.849
 here is linked to the super friendly capital 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.139
 that we see in there these little gifts and cyclists now 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.029
 it's true there are a lot of people who are waving me 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.029
 the quine for the chauriens the plates tomorrow it will be assured 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.009
 it's amazing so in fact I see only one default michel 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.240
 the vine appear as full we do how 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.310
 and well in case of rain in fact like usa mikhail acquired what 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.639
 the room in an area of ​​turmoil with lots of taboos on France 2 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.169
 françois j 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.889
 more than ever there 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.669
 patatra 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.329
 thanks to an excellent I do not agree 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.329
 you evoke strong development support 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.040
 that's all skirting set by the deed believe we're not going to do it because we 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.059
 you will hear more 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.259
 The absence of too much to go the bari can rain I have only lattaquié 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.889
 so in my opinion it's really a very well crafted craft 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.309
 many Irish people use it so 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.549
 the regulator to go to work for landis is not very very good and 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.429
 in convalescence so I can they get to work without being 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.259
 completely soaked adjourned no no he's delusional michel professor at 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.969
 the university of strasbourg 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.449
 I propose it's a midfielder
