with<00:02:26.489> retro<00:02:26.849> 8-bit<00:02:27.290> graphic<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> highly

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
with retro 8-bit graphic is highly

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.360 
with retro 8-bit graphic is highly
evaluated<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.569> think<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.080> bad

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
evaluated and I think that's this bad

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.190 
evaluated and I think that's this bad
translation<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.569> pretty<00:02:33.780> cool<00:02:34.019> game

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
translation but it's a pretty cool game

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.300 
translation but it's a pretty cool game
anyway<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.310> definitely<00:02:36.060> worth<00:02:36.209> checking<00:02:36.629> out

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
anyway so definitely worth checking out

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.640 
anyway so definitely worth checking out
slightly<00:02:38.310> retro<00:02:38.730> risk<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.450> think<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.319> hugely

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
slightly retro risk I think it's hugely

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.729 
slightly retro risk I think it's hugely
long<00:02:40.950> maybe<00:02:41.400> more<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> couple<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> hours<00:02:43.590> or

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
long maybe more not a couple of hours or

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.070 
long maybe more not a couple of hours or
something<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:45.090> I'll<00:02:45.420> definitely<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.930> trying

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
something so I'll definitely be trying

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.490 
something so I'll definitely be trying
to<00:02:46.260> check<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.739> out<00:02:46.769> for<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.459> well
