I<00:00:00.299> guess<00:00:00.659> in<00:00:00.810> terms<00:00:00.989> of<00:00:01.110> evidence-based

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
I guess in terms of evidence-based

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.260 
I guess in terms of evidence-based
medicine<00:00:01.740> I've<00:00:02.250> had<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> sort<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.850> interest

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
medicine I've had a sort of interest

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.120 
medicine I've had a sort of interest
right<00:00:03.780> from<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.110> start<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.440> medical<00:00:04.830> school

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
right from the start of medical school

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.099 
right from the start of medical school
actually<00:00:05.609> within<00:00:06.330> about<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> first<00:00:06.690> few

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
actually within about the first few

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.810 
actually within about the first few
weeks<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.440> arriving<00:00:07.919> here<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.280> Oxford<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.700> was

evidence-based medicine is is the

evidence-based medicine is is the

a washing machine

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
a washing machine
they've<00:00:45.719> put<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> lot<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> energy<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
they've put a lot of energy in it and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
they've put a lot of energy in it and
sort<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> time<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.899> know<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.500> at

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
sort of time look you know they look at

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
sort of time look you know they look at
the<00:00:49.710> energy<00:00:50.070> rating<00:00:50.280> they<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> cost

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the energy rating they look at the cost

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
the energy rating they look at the cost
they<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.930> about<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.680> brand<00:00:53.010> recognition

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they think about the brand recognition

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
they think about the brand recognition
they<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.270> may<00:00:54.390> ask<00:00:54.570> their<00:00:54.780> friends<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
they like they may ask their friends and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.330 
they like they may ask their friends and
then<00:00:55.410> suddenly<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:55.890> come<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
then suddenly they come to take a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
then suddenly they come to take a
treatment<00:00:56.789> onboard<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.930> think

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
treatment onboard and you can think

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.299 
treatment onboard and you can think
about<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.469> yourself<00:00:58.859> you'll<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
about this yourself you'll have a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.680 
about this yourself you'll have a
treatment<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.390> ask<00:01:00.510> any

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
treatment and you don't ask any

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
treatment and you don't ask any
questions<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.649> evidence<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:02.730> much

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
questions about the evidence how much

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600 
questions about the evidence how much
benefit<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.409> were<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> harms<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
benefit I get what were the harms and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
benefit I get what were the harms and
often<00:01:06.000> will<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.540> treatments<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.260> we've<00:01:07.409> done

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
often will use treatments and we've done

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.960 
often will use treatments and we've done
this<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> past<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.700> aren't

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
this a lot in the past that aren't

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
this a lot in the past that aren't
evidence-based<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.530> there

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
evidence-based actually I think there

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
evidence-based actually I think there
are<00:01:10.799> three<00:01:11.040> things<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.580> wanted<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> do

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
are three things I do wanted to do

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.010 
are three things I do wanted to do
research<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.310> second<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> teach<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.450> then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
research the second is a teach and then

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
research the second is a teach and then
the<00:01:16.110> third<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.710> often<00:01:17.159> people<00:01:17.340> are

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the third thing which often people are

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.910 
the third thing which often people are
totally<00:01:17.939> ignore<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.290> job<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
totally ignore is my job is to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.490 
totally ignore is my job is to
communicate<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> wider<00:01:21.030> audience<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> I'm

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
communicate to a wider audience so I'm

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
communicate to a wider audience so I'm
very<00:01:22.740> aware<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.310> whatever<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.360> doing<00:01:24.540> in

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
very aware that whatever I'm doing in

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.390 
very aware that whatever I'm doing in
them<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> its<00:01:25.170> fears<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.560> should<00:01:25.740> meet<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.159> work

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
them to its fears I should meet my work

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
them to its fears I should meet my work
publicly<00:01:26.939> available<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.140> yes<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.770> an

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
active Twitter account we have a blog
that<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.350> run<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.040> try<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.549> work<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> media

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
that I run I try and work with the media

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.690 
that I run I try and work with the media
quite<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.829> interesting<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
quite a lot and that's interesting and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
quite a lot and that's interesting and
with<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> newspapers<00:01:36.360> sometimes<00:01:37.110> they've

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
with the newspapers sometimes they've

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
with the newspapers sometimes they've
got<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.680> active<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.090> he's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
morning I've just looked at another 11

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.310 
morning I've just looked at another 11
application<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.479> increasing<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
application so it's increasing all the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.670 
application so it's increasing all the
time<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.399> active<00:02:02.729> DPhil<00:02:03.210> program<00:02:03.750> PhD

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
time and an active DPhil program PhD

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
time and an active DPhil program PhD
which<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> full<00:02:05.369> final<00:02:05.790> end<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> like

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
which is the full final end if you like

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.600 
which is the full final end if you like
and<00:02:07.439> that's<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.649> pretty<00:02:07.829> big<00:02:08.009> program<00:02:08.489> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and that's a pretty big program of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
and that's a pretty big program of
trying<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> train<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> teach<00:02:09.599> people<00:02:09.770> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
trying to train and teach people the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.930 
trying to train and teach people the
second<00:02:11.160> thing<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.760> really

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
second thing is then we're really

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
second thing is then we're really
interested<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> methods

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
interested in the methods

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.250 
interested in the methods
how<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:13.829> apply<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> research<00:02:14.909> particular<00:02:15.629> so

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
how you apply the research particular so

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.509 
how you apply the research particular so
it's<00:02:16.409> okay<00:02:16.650> saying<00:02:16.950> you've<00:02:17.129> got<00:02:17.189> all<00:02:17.370> this

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
it's okay saying you've got all this

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.550 
it's okay saying you've got all this
research<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.719> I<00:02:18.749> don't<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.959> actually<00:02:19.260> apply

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
research but I don't you actually apply

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
research but I don't you actually apply
it<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.829> patient<00:02:20.219> care<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.609> then<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.299> can

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
it to patient care and then you can

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
it to patient care and then you can
think<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.659> all<00:02:21.840> sorts<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.319> factors<00:02:22.739> for

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
think of all sorts of factors for

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.369 
think of all sorts of factors for
instance<00:02:23.280> very<00:02:23.780> simply<00:02:24.780> communication

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
instance very simply communication

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.470 
instance very simply communication
there's<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.159> great<00:02:26.430> area<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.239> alright

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
there's a great area so it's alright

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.879 
there's a great area so it's alright
having<00:02:27.719> all<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> research<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.469> the<00:02:28.530> evidence

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
having all the research all the evidence

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.410 
having all the research all the evidence
but<00:02:29.040> how<00:02:29.159> do<00:02:29.219> you<00:02:29.310> communicate<00:02:29.519> in<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.150> way<00:02:30.180> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
but how do you communicate in a way to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.530 
but how do you communicate in a way to
patient<00:02:30.989> that's<00:02:31.829> understandable<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:33.329> makes

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
patient that's understandable that makes

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
patient that's understandable that makes
sense<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.200> I'll<00:02:34.560> actually<00:02:34.680> change<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.549> way

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
sense and I'll actually change the way

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.900 
sense and I'll actually change the way
they<00:02:35.849> think<00:02:35.879> about<00:02:36.299> their<00:02:36.599> healthcare
