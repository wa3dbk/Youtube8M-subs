identity crisis and stuff like that and
it's<00:00:42.030> very<00:00:42.770> hard<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.129> someone<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:44.760> they

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it's very hard on someone when they

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.569 
it's very hard on someone when they
can't<00:00:45.180> express<00:00:45.690> who<00:00:46.230> who<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.550> feel

and<00:00:49.160> for<00:00:50.160> theory<00:00:50.370> ins<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> time

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and for theory ins a lot of the time

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510 
and for theory ins a lot of the time
expressing<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.079> wearing<00:00:52.649> collars<00:00:53.219> and

and contacts and stuff like that to make

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.240

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
us feel more at home in our own bodies

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.270 
us feel more at home in our own bodies
and<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:03.719> guess<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.290> topic<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.100> want

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and I guess the topic that I really want

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
and I guess the topic that I really want
to<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:06.119> after<00:01:06.299> today<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.680> bit

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to go after today is just a little bit

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.600 
to go after today is just a little bit
of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> rant<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:09.110> public<00:01:10.110> schools<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:11.100> allowing

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
of a rant is public schools not allowing

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
of a rant is public schools not allowing
Syrian<00:01:12.150> students<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> wear<00:01:13.020> their<00:01:13.170> tales<00:01:13.409> in

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
class and this was never a problem for

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
class and this was never a problem for
me<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> school<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.930> didn't<00:01:19.710> have

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
me in school because I didn't have

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.700 
me in school because I didn't have
enough<00:01:20.009> money<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.400> own<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> tail<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.810> did<00:01:22.350> wear<00:01:22.530> my

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.410 
just adds to the turmoil of being in
school<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.239> lot<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> times<00:02:12.840> it's

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
school like a lot of the times it's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.670 
school like a lot of the times it's
either<00:02:13.599> middle<00:02:14.020> school<00:02:14.230> or<00:02:14.319> high<00:02:14.349> school

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
either middle school or high school

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
either middle school or high school
students<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.520> problem<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:17.700> it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
students that have this problem and it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.870 
students that have this problem and it's
a<00:02:19.209> little<00:02:19.569> annoying<00:02:19.959> because<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:21.250> me<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
a little annoying because for me the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.580 
a little annoying because for me the
entropy<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.569> more<00:02:23.080> than<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:26.560> I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
entropy is more than just like what I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.990 
entropy is more than just like what I
wear<00:02:26.950> or<00:02:27.959> who<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:28.989> hang<00:02:29.410> out<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.130> part<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
wear or who I hang out with it's part of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.710 
wear or who I hang out with it's part of
me<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.600> part<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.959> my<00:02:32.170> belief<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.450> part<00:02:34.450> of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
me it is part of my belief and a part of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.650 
me it is part of my belief and a part of
who<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.989> am<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> person<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.660> taking

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
who I am as a person and taking

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.420 
who I am as a person and taking
something<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.380> away<00:02:38.620> from<00:02:38.890> someone<00:02:39.130> is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
something like that away from someone is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.600 
something like that away from someone is
in<00:02:40.410> much<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.650> same<00:02:41.830> way<00:02:41.980> taking<00:02:42.280> away

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
in much of the same way taking away

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.240 
in much of the same way taking away
across<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.450> necklace<00:02:44.019> or<00:02:44.260> across<00:02:44.560> from<00:02:45.160> a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
across a necklace or across from a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.440 
across a necklace or across from a
student<00:02:45.610> who<00:02:45.700> wears<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.730> not

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
student who wears it and that's just not

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.420 
student who wears it and that's just not
right<00:02:49.810> that's<00:02:50.110> religious<00:02:51.069> discrimination

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
right that's religious discrimination

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
right that's religious discrimination
and<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.480> think<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> should<00:02:53.080> be<00:02:53.140> stopped<00:02:54.450> public

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
and I think it should be stopped public

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.750 
and I think it should be stopped public
schools<00:02:55.750> who<00:02:56.080> say<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.130> tales<00:02:57.370> aren't

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
schools who say that tales aren't

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940 
schools who say that tales aren't
allowed<00:02:58.030> because<00:02:58.269> their<00:02:58.750> distractions<00:02:59.290> are

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
allowed because their distractions are

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.370 
allowed because their distractions are
just<00:03:00.340> being<00:03:01.090> ridiculous<00:03:01.630> because<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.140> think

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
just being ridiculous because I think

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.680 
just being ridiculous because I think
one<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.769> all<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.220> behind<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.150> can't<00:03:04.480> pay

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
one of all it's behind you you can't pay

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.809 
one of all it's behind you you can't pay
attention<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.819> if<00:03:07.769> sorry<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:09.010> lost<00:03:09.670> my

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
attention to it and if sorry I lost my

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.070 
attention to it and if sorry I lost my
train<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.090> thought<00:03:10.209> there<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.690> second<00:03:10.959> what

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
train of thought there for a second what

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.370 
train of thought there for a second what
was<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.290> talking<00:03:11.410> about<00:03:12.330> right<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.630> other

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
was I talking about right and other

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.410

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
students who complain about it being a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.050 
students who complain about it being a
distraction<00:03:17.280> they<00:03:18.280> have<00:03:18.459> their<00:03:18.609> own<00:03:18.760> issues
