00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
saying earlier it's because there's

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.680 
saying earlier it's because there's
always<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.230> make<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.420> professional<00:02:21.420> and

what you can do in this studio and what

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470 
what you can do in this studio and what
you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.320> do<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.130> stand<00:02:35.400> at<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> sky<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
you can do you can stand at the sky and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.140 
you can do you can stand at the sky and
everything<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.140> completely<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.790> changes

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
everything is completely it changes

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.490 
everything is completely it changes
everything<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.660> they<00:02:39.780> purchase<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.350> hard

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
everything so they purchase really hard

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
everything so they purchase really hard
into<00:02:40.650> Versalles<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.519> guess<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.760> can't

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
