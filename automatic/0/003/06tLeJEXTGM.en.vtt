guys<00:00:03.159> we<00:00:03.370> get<00:00:03.490> a<00:00:03.520> brand<00:00:03.850> new<00:00:04.030> processors

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.810 
guys we get a brand new processors

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.720 
guys we get a brand new processors
specifically<00:00:05.470> for<00:00:05.680> the<00:00:05.770> new<00:00:06.160> sandybridge

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
specifically for the new sandybridge

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.200 
specifically for the new sandybridge
line<00:00:07.150> of<00:00:07.300> processors<00:00:07.480> I<00:00:08.580> personally<00:00:09.580> decided

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
line of processors I personally decided

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.410 
line of processors I personally decided
to<00:00:10.390> go<00:00:10.480> to<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.630> i7<00:00:11.110> 2670<00:00:14.430> plier<00:00:15.430> but<00:00:15.849> enough

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
to go to the i7 2670 plier but enough

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.480 
to go to the i7 2670 plier but enough
with<00:00:16.690> talking<00:00:17.140> about<00:00:17.350> it<00:00:17.500> let's<00:00:17.740> get<00:00:17.950> it<00:00:18.070> open

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
with talking about it let's get it open

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:29.010 
with talking about it let's get it open
Oh<00:00:25.830> busted<00:00:26.830> until<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.940> cheap<00:00:28.210> now<00:00:28.449> cuz<00:00:28.840> this

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
Oh busted until it cheap now cuz this

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.719 
Oh busted until it cheap now cuz this
used<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.289> be<00:00:29.380> plastic<00:00:29.859> around<00:00:31.469> heatsink<00:00:32.469> um<00:00:33.429> if

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:33.729 
used to be plastic around heatsink um if

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.250 
used to be plastic around heatsink um if
you're<00:00:34.300> watching<00:00:34.449> this<00:00:34.690> video<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.109> probably

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
you're watching this video you probably

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.469 
you're watching this video you probably
will<00:00:36.039> not<00:00:36.190> be<00:00:36.399> using<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:36.819> heat<00:00:37.030> sink<00:00:37.329> because

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.479 
will not be using this heat sink because

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.500 
will not be using this heat sink because
it<00:00:37.659> is<00:00:37.780> utter<00:00:38.019> and<00:00:38.319> complete<00:00:38.379> garbage<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:40.329> an

comes with one of these nice little

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:52.910 
comes with one of these nice little
processor<00:00:50.710> caddies<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.339> that's<00:00:51.609> always<00:00:51.909> nice

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
processor caddies so that's always nice

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.329 
processor caddies so that's always nice
very<00:00:53.920> cool<00:00:54.249> very<00:00:54.519> cool<00:00:55.499> like<00:00:56.499> that<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.709> lot<00:00:56.920> it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
very cool very cool like that a lot it

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.419 
very cool very cool like that a lot it
shows<00:00:57.670> which<00:00:57.969> processor<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:58.719> is<00:00:59.129> I'll<00:01:00.129> said

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
shows which processor it is I'll said

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.250 
shows which processor it is I'll said
show<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:01.329> thought<00:01:01.659> it<00:01:01.749> showed<00:01:01.899> when<00:01:02.079> it<00:01:02.170> was

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
show I thought it showed when it was

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.400 
show I thought it showed when it was
manufactured<00:01:02.709> you<00:01:03.039> know<00:01:03.100> but<00:01:03.369> 3.4<00:01:03.999> gigahertz

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
manufactured you know but 3.4 gigahertz

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.780 
manufactured you know but 3.4 gigahertz

may<00:01:10.270> have<00:01:10.300> noticed<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:10.780> do<00:01:10.870> not<00:01:10.990> have<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.200> sandy

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
may have noticed we do not have a sandy

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.170 
may have noticed we do not have a sandy
bridge<00:01:11.830> board<00:01:12.190> just<00:01:12.490> yet<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:12.970> we're<00:01:13.150> just

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
bridge board just yet so we're just

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.540 
bridge board just yet so we're just
going<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.420> do<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.660> unboxing<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:15.400> we'll

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
going to do the unboxing and then we'll

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.520 
going to do the unboxing and then we'll
get<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.700> motherboard<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.450> put<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:16.900> in<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.230> test

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
get a motherboard and put it in and test

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.100 
get a motherboard and put it in and test
it<00:01:17.680> see<00:01:17.800> how<00:01:17.860> go<00:01:17.980> so<00:01:18.160> wicked<00:01:18.370> genocide<00:01:19.110> alright

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
it see how go so wicked genocide alright

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.770 
it see how go so wicked genocide alright
guys<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.430> ran<00:01:21.790> sent<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.150> bench<00:01:22.330> on<00:01:22.720> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
guys we just ran sent a bench on the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.660 
guys we just ran sent a bench on the
xeon<00:01:23.530> x<00:01:24.400> 38<00:01:25.180> 430<00:01:25.930> 440<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:27.580> have

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
xeon x 38 430 440 and we have

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.880 
xeon x 38 430 440 and we have
overclocked<00:01:28.120> at<00:01:28.240> 3.41<00:01:28.930> gigahertz<00:01:29.440> this<00:01:29.770> is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
overclocked at 3.41 gigahertz this is

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.010 
overclocked at 3.41 gigahertz this is
closer<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.220> get<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.520> 3.4<00:01:31.210> which<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.750> stock

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
closer to get to 3.4 which is the stock

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.510 
closer to get to 3.4 which is the stock
speed<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.680> i7<00:01:33.400> 2670<00:01:36.810> score<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.930> 5.8<00:01:38.560> one<00:01:38.800> so

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
speed of the i7 2670 score of 5.8 one so

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.740 
speed of the i7 2670 score of 5.8 one so
we're<00:01:39.790> going<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.970> be<00:01:40.030> comparing<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.570> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
we're going to be comparing that to the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.350 
we're going to be comparing that to the
stock<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.260> seven<00:01:41.770> just<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.340> see<00:01:42.550> how<00:01:43.180> much

stock I seven just to see how much

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.950 
stock I seven just to see how much
better<00:01:43.659> this<00:01:43.930> sandy<00:01:44.680> bridge<00:01:44.830> technology<00:01:45.490> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
better this sandy bridge technology and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920 
better this sandy bridge technology and
how<00:01:46.960> awesome<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:48.720> we'll<00:01:49.720> go<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.870> that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
how awesome it is so we'll go to that

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.730 
how awesome it is so we'll go to that
score<00:01:50.260> next<00:01:50.760> alright<00:01:51.760> guys<00:01:51.940> we're<00:01:52.210> back<00:01:52.740> get

against an i7 950 as you can see it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.559 
against an i7 950 as you can see it
smashed<00:02:07.990> an<00:02:08.259> i7<00:02:08.499> 960<00:02:09.340> scorch<00:02:09.819> so<00:02:10.239> there's

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
smashed an i7 960 scorch so there's

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
yeah these new sandy bridge processors

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.390 
yeah these new sandy bridge processors
are<00:02:15.940> in<00:02:16.240> fact<00:02:16.450> extremely<00:02:17.110> beast<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:19.920> uh<00:02:20.920> no
