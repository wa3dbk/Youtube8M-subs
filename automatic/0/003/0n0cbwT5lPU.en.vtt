00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 Hi everyone this time will continue to talk about major scale 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:22.200
 I really though I think some people think I major scale 6 cun so 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:28.160
 It is such an easy thing and use the word "major scale" 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:33.110
 If you look at the various 7 years old it is very difficult to write 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.470
 That's right, so here it's a bit flat 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.739
 I will explain gently and briefly 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.010
 For example, we were to do the scale of the do, re, mi, fa Sorashido 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 For example 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.480
 me 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.290
 This is Doremifasolaid 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 [musics] 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.010
 me 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.910
 This is to say major scale of the I c refers to that of the Do-Re-Mi file Sorashido 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.910
 I will 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.670
 How about this 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.110
 Uu 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.180
 But by going voice so to hear I think that sounds I do, re, mi, fa Sorashido 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 Because this is good 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.200
 It has started from 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 [musics] 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.790
 here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.520
 I think you remember the sound of this time etc. Curran 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:25.130
 boots 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.640
 Since this has started from Maggie from major scale here is the root of ac 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.640
 Hmmm 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:36.320
 It will be referred to as the d major scale of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.480
 It's easy, so if you have a good major scale, it will only start from there 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.230
 pandan 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:49.430
 That's to say, so before that, I played Doremi's scale over and over again 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:55.070
 O two of the here Let's Dad here is what sounds like this Fu 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.480
 It's because of this I said that even if I can't play that terrifying guitar, that guitar is 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.020
 Though certainly play to play 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.520
 You know various public offering, for example, that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.930
 Your behavior I think you even something code 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.500
 By suppressing the action 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:16.210
 Even if it is rare and cheap, if it is an older brother from this 6 string 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:21.940
 I made to the specifications but I think that some people that say that the reason you do not know well 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.819
 Know the knowledge that what strings will hold what fret and what will sound what 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.130
 By 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.750
 These scale notes 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.920
 then 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:38.870
 For example, is it that this time, or does it mean that the code rase booth is 8 times? 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.460
 It will come to be understood gradually with such words, but the story was slightly derailed 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.460
 But let's remember like this 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.140
 Story of this Doremi phasoraid 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.739
 If you have subscribed a little , I think you 're probably looking at it 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 so 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:59.090
 Written in short, the city Daikoe whole tone the number fret is a fit if and I do I think it has been found 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.340
 But we have you 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.870
 It's also entangled before and after 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.470
 But 3 3 from Calafa city. How ' 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:17.450
 Last time won 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:22.280
 Two ponponponpe Iibobo sama will have three pom poms and also last 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:27.920
 This configuration is called major scale 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.840
 I was playing major scale it from that record by replacing the earlier Mr. Then this 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.150
 If we apply the law 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:40.120
 Seeing from the top is a roar, right? 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.190
 Because far from 3 is a half-tone move, naturally I have to raise the leaf soar 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.440
 If you go major scale 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.220
 Because 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.740
 8 marked with Phang Nga Sharp 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.830
 From Tifa there is a move from that spot if you follow the law there from the sharp of Pa 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.950
 It's gently Howe sound 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:02.310
 I am in Kyoto and I make an error 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.310
 Although this is as it is this time, it is all right 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.580
 c or not 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:15.490
 Because this is also up on the move 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:21.610
 It's catching and I'm a semitone Handai movement as it is for me the way also scolded I'd go this way 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:24.870
 So when it comes to medical care before that it will be 2 fret colors and overworked will be sharpened 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:28.020
 # Means that high 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.120
 It's called the color flat that pulls the plate 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:38.800
 So in the end the woman from that Les 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:42.550
 Which sharp is the half color to move the cat 's octave 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.889
 It will be said that this is the theory 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:54.939
 Even if this law is remembered firmly, or that guitar of that Dremifasorashid said with the guitar 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:57.460
 The first part is after if we remember even the form of the movement of the finger 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.860
 What if the scene's major scale? 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.590
 I try to pull from Udo 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.490
 If it is a major scale of d 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.360
 I try to pull from the back 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.090
 Just move 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.100
 In this sense I think I'm such This went so 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.070
 Guitar chords and together code also by shifting the 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.900
 The code name changes 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.420
 It will be that kind of thing 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:28.300
 If this is remembered that mechanism 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:30.540
 It the key of the c is said to Hama Sushi become incarnated be many times that code change 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.150
 Sheet a minor 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.230
 dmi N Dah 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.380
 Day 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.449
 Let's say you have an advertisement, for example g 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:45.310
 If you want to go higher 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:49.720
 Use the pace or patter to capo on the 2nd fret and just listen in the same court 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.610
 I can sing at that one high and high place though 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.080
 Even if you don't do that 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:06:02.629
 For that action, for example, if it is c it is because it is one tone up 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.900
 Let's try playing with d a minor If that position is up, that position is Konosuke code 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:10.120
 So be my 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.810
 I think some people are looking for a conversion table or something like that, but yes 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.000
 If you write it out without saying 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:23.450
 It can be seen also if you know this theory 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:28.700
 The only thing that you can convert yourself is that the music is about you 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:34.430
 That initially only Toka conversion table but it might take wing because it is chocolate that 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:37.020
 It also stands up to time and those who do not rely not said so Na is good will rely on the table 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.710
 I will not be able to wear such things 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.639
 Also when you make elevation yourself 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.030
 That 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:49.640
 I will be back again 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:53.330
 So let's remember these basic theories well 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:58.540
 This law was about the major scale this time 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.540
 Please remember well Negotiation Thank you for watching 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.280
 I forgot to explain that 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.540
 Just before that major scale of d 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.729
 I did it, so it's fur 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:19.529
 At the place and soil 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:22.740
 It is I'm at the dot fan has said to Fu say Datte sharp music of the d 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:27.590
 Two sides of the key written 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:33.770
 What is written like this comes from that kind of thing 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:39.260
 If I remember this together, I could just get the number of the number flat of that sharp in the two years 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.950
 Oh this what code I think it is seen that the Tteyuu what's the key also to remember together 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.360
 Let's get up 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:48.980
 In addition, since such a surface homepage is always made, please have a look by all means 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.980
 Thank you for watching
