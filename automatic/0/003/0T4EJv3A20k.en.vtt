 Most graves along at home, especially that of the city of Seoul city at the time of the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:17.550
 There were a lot of unemployed people with a lot of poor people flowing in . 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:22.560
 These unemployed people are unlimited and also have this

 1 to control the number of grooves by removing all the soil from Cheonggye Stream 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 Depending equipped to ensure the function of the attachments open agency five years 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 So this Cheonggyecheon total project 2 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.980
 There are two types of rabbits, the absence of the unemployed and the prevention of damage after home. 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.520
 It was therefore the policy can be viewed 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:47.489
 You guys, we look like 4 hours in the world. 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 In the United States, the ud 1 policy is that during the Great Depression of the United States, President Roosevelt 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.270
 By establishing the civil engineering project at that time 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.350
 The unemployed are also relieved and some of the nation's finances are based on these things. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.730
 Expand 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.820
 There are some students who know that they have taken such steps . 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.030
 That's right. 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.070
 This form of prevention and relief of the unemployed beolyeoseo Home bark of Public Works project 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.930
 Mach 2 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:23.270
 Far ahead of time even if the US New Deal for our spirit with these books 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.990
 By establishing a policy I finished it successfully is something that yireongeo yet 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.670
 That's the kind of thing we have to look at . 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.300
 And after using the service, 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.759
 I emphasized that this should continue in later generations . 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:47.450
 I sold this class in my day and completed the construction, but after that 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:49.070
 The later kings to continue its integral multiples of one thousand shares at any floor business now 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.970
 Degree 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:02:01.100
 I believed that the Cheonggyecheon bridge and the four letters of Kyungjin Jipyeong 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.600
 So I marked it on the bridge, so the four letters 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.880
 On this bridge 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.650
 If I put three of those stones, I know the four letters are always in crisis. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:19.150
 When stacked with the involvement of even one letter in the first character again jeongjae 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:24.079
 There was this one means it completed by the construction also contained the later kings 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.780
 I have continued to make a considerable effort to do these 1000 Incheon Chuncheon projects 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:33.320
 Therefore , 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:38.840
 4 But he still retained that function of the city while preventing the flood damage 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:41.480
 So you can see and fairly In the 2000 Office Service 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.670
