00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
start doing the thing it's light it's

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.340 
start doing the thing it's light it's
good<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.670> loads<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.200> then

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
good because it loads to do but then

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
good because it loads to do but then
once<00:01:55.619> you've<00:01:55.829> built<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> stacks

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
once you've built all like the stacks

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.020 
once you've built all like the stacks
and<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> breaches<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.049> rooms<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.040> the

and the breaches and rooms and that the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
and the breaches and rooms and that the
 part<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> basically<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.320> putting<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
 part is basically like putting in a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.580 
 part is basically like putting in a
detail<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.880> putting<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.960> hell<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
detail like putting these hell in the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.240 
detail like putting these hell in the
rooms<00:02:04.890> putting<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.700> chest<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.900 
i think it's what gave up hope on
up<00:02:13.370> towards<00:02:13.790> like<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> detail<00:02:14.690> part<00:02:14.990> so<00:02:15.910> we

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
up towards like the detail part so we
