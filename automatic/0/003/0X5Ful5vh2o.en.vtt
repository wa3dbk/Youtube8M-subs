supply<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.360> get<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> spawning<00:00:12.900> pool<00:00:13.230> which

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
supply you get a spawning pool which

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.870 
supply you get a spawning pool which
means<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.009> get<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.250> before<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.610> make

base<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.369> quickly<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.850> possible<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> right<00:00:23.100> now

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
base as quickly as possible so right now

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.609 
base as quickly as possible so right now
I'm<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.670> having<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.269> drones<00:00:24.990> mind

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
I'm just having all my drones mind

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
I'm just having all my drones mind
that's<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.460> need<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.880> until<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> get

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that's all you need to do until you get

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.810 
that's all you need to do until you get
200<00:00:27.660> minerals<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.980> immediately<00:00:29.429> make<00:00:29.640> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
200 minerals then immediately make that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
200 minerals then immediately make that
spawning<00:00:30.179> pool<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> third<00:00:31.619> one

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
spawning pool so you get the third one

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.209 
spawning pool so you get the third one
side<00:00:32.719> then<00:00:33.719> once<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.070> up

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
side then once you have that you know up

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
side then once you have that you know up
and<00:00:35.370> running<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.820> build<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.780> more

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and running you can build two more

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.650 
and running you can build two more
drones<00:00:37.649> once<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> minerals<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
drones once you get the minerals for it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
drones once you get the minerals for it
because<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.770> only<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.969> only

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
because you only need like you're only

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.590 
because you only need like you're only
going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.390> able<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:42.780> three

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
going to be able to make three

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.049 
going to be able to make three
zergling<00:00:43.840> sets<00:00:44.350> at<00:00:44.590> once<00:00:44.800> when<00:00:45.609> these<00:00:45.789> drones

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
zergling sets at once when these drones

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.049 
zergling sets at once when these drones
can<00:00:46.300> help<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:46.539> mind<00:00:47.519> so<00:00:48.519> to<00:00:48.579> make<00:00:48.670> your<00:00:48.910> two

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
can help you mind so to make your two

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.439 
can help you mind so to make your two
drones<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.839> at<00:00:50.019> a<00:00:50.050> red<00:00:50.769> seven<00:00:51.309> supplies<00:00:52.089> so

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
drones and is at a red seven supplies so

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.450 
drones and is at a red seven supplies so
we<00:00:52.480> just<00:00:52.690> chill<00:00:52.960> now<00:00:53.170> until<00:00:53.589> this<00:00:53.800> spawning

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
we just chill now until this spawning

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.790 
we just chill now until this spawning
cool<00:00:54.850> stuff<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.359> then<00:00:55.750> we're<00:00:55.870> going<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.019> you

cool stuff and then we're going to you
know<00:00:56.890> just<00:00:57.070> set<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.370> way<00:00:57.489> point<00:00:57.789> for<00:00:58.089> the

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
know just set the way point for the

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.780 
know just set the way point for the
hatchery<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.739> enemy<00:01:00.010> base<00:01:00.159> and<00:01:00.579> as<00:01:00.640> soon

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
hatchery into the enemy base and as soon

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.040 
hatchery into the enemy base and as soon
as<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.089> is

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
as this is

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.439 
as this is
make<00:01:02.290> three<00:01:02.530> sets<00:01:02.770> of<00:01:02.890> zerglings<00:01:03.360> that<00:01:04.360> will

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
make three sets of zerglings that will

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.790 
make three sets of zerglings that will
hopefully<00:01:04.570> catch<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> enemy<00:01:05.229> off<00:01:05.500> guard

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
hopefully catch the enemy off guard

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.950 
hopefully catch the enemy off guard
before<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.280> has<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.400> chance<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:07.210> react<00:01:07.720> stop

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
F&amp;C spawning pools on the stun

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.880 
F&amp;C spawning pools on the stun
everyone's<00:01:16.500> come<00:01:16.740> up

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
everyone's come up

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.340 
everyone's come up
once<00:01:18.280> they're<00:01:18.490> built

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
once they're built

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.929 
once they're built
well<00:01:20.950> you're<00:01:21.070> going<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.220> want<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.430> try<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.670> once

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
well you're going to want to try to once

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.040 
well you're going to want to try to once
you<00:01:22.030> at<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> 100<00:01:22.900> minerals

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
you at a 100 minerals

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.470 
you at a 100 minerals
so<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:24.740> can<00:01:24.920> expand<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.640> supply<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.300> keep

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
so you can expand that supply and keep

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.100 
so you can expand that supply and keep
building<00:01:27.730> they're<00:01:28.730> going<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:29.000> keep<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
building they're going to keep the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.710 
building they're going to keep the
attack<00:01:30.950> on<00:01:31.190> his<00:01:31.280> face<00:01:31.520> card

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.660 

as<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.470> can<00:01:35.560> see<00:01:35.800> right<00:01:36.040> now

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
as you can see right now

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.630 
as you can see right now
they're<00:01:38.299> going<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.930> hopeful

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
they're going in and hopeful

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.500 
they're going in and hopeful
this<00:01:39.909> will<00:01:40.090> work<00:01:40.210> out

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.910 

the<00:01:43.930> same<00:01:44.140> time<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.650> overlords<00:01:45.160> almost<00:01:45.430> done

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the same time the overlords almost done

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.990 
the same time the overlords almost done
make<00:01:47.070> another<00:01:47.280> set<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.729> arrogance

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.090 

there's<00:01:52.630> really<00:01:52.780> no<00:01:52.990> point<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.440> do<00:01:53.800> center

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
there's really no point to do center

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.650 
there's really no point to do center
producing<00:01:54.640> any<00:01:54.760> drugs<00:01:55.120> because<00:01:55.450> at<00:01:55.540> this

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
producing any drugs because at this

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.380 
producing any drugs because at this
point<00:01:55.840> you're<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.350> far<00:01:56.590> behind<00:01:56.620> that<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:58.210> you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
point you're so far behind that if you

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.870 
point you're so far behind that if you
don't<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:59.710> them<00:01:59.920> out<00:02:00.040> with<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:00.760> know

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
don't take them out with this you know

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.090 
don't take them out with this you know
first<00:02:01.240> we're<00:02:01.720> not<00:02:01.870> first<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.380> put<00:02:02.620> this<00:02:02.740> attack

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
first we're not first we put this attack

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.630 
the Gateway so you can sell it out as
quickly<00:04:06.810> as<00:04:06.990> possible

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
quickly as possible

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.309 
quickly as possible
again<00:04:09.030> I'll<00:04:09.150> speed<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.420> up<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.990> then<00:04:10.080> at<00:04:10.200> this

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
again I'll speed it up and then at this

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.680 
again I'll speed it up and then at this
point<00:04:10.470> once<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.640> gateways<00:04:12.180> feel<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:12.600> you

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
point once the gateways feel then you

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.530 
point once the gateways feel then you
can<00:04:12.840> start<00:04:13.050> Crona<00:04:13.440> boosting<00:04:13.890> probes<00:04:14.550> out<00:04:14.790> just

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
can start Crona boosting probes out just

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.490 
can start Crona boosting probes out just
to<00:04:15.690> increase<00:04:15.870> your<00:04:16.140> economy<00:04:16.769> get<00:04:16.920> some

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
make sure you save some energy for the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.960 
make sure you save some energy for the
Gateway<00:04:22.150> though<00:04:22.389> once<00:04:23.139> it's<00:04:23.319> done
