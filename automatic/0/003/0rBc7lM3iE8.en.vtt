everybody<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:35.939> playing<00:01:36.540> field<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
everybody on the same playing field you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
everybody on the same playing field you
know<00:01:37.710> we're<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.009> musicians<00:01:38.159> we're<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:38.909> doing

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
know we're all musicians we're all doing

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.969 
know we're all musicians we're all doing
it<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> same<00:01:39.960> reasons<00:01:40.380> hopefully<00:01:40.770> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it for the same reasons hopefully just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
it for the same reasons hopefully just
pleasure<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.670> love<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.970> music<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.899> why

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pleasure and love of music and so why

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
pleasure and love of music and so why
shouldn't<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.680> play<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.909> also<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
shouldn't we play but I also think it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.700 
shouldn't we play but I also think it
has<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> philosophy<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
has to do with the philosophy of the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.870 
has to do with the philosophy of the
competition<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
competition which is that it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
competition which is that it's
competition<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> misnomer<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
competition is actually a misnomer it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
competition is actually a misnomer it's
more<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.549> violin<00:01:50.970> festival<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.869> really

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
more of a violin festival it's really

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.190 
more of a violin festival it's really
