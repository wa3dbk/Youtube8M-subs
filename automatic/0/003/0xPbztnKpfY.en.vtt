00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
my basement kind of yielded an

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
my basement kind of yielded an
interesting<00:00:27.840> solution<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:29.099> better<00:00:29.369> than

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
interesting solution that is better than

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.170 
interesting solution that is better than
nothing<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.109> cost<00:00:31.109> me<00:00:31.289> $0<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.579> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
nothing and cost me $0 so here we go so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.090 
nothing and cost me $0 so here we go so
if<00:00:33.300> you're<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.540> me<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.290> got<00:00:34.440> any<00:00:34.620> number<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
if you're like me you got any number of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.479 
if you're like me you got any number of
old<00:00:35.360> crappy<00:00:36.360> headphones<00:00:37.110> lying<00:00:37.380> around<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
old crappy headphones lying around and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.970 
old crappy headphones lying around and
when<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.270> call<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> look<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.710> wonder

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
when I call you look at that I wonder

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.229 
when I call you look at that I wonder
what<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> guy<00:00:41.309> could<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.790> something<00:00:41.969> like

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
what a guy could do with something like

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.459 
what a guy could do with something like
that<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> remove<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.539> foam

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that so as you can see I remove the foam

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.889 
that so as you can see I remove the foam
ear<00:00:47.190> cover<00:00:47.460> nice<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.120> soft<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.719> not

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
ear cover nice and soft it's not

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.029 
ear cover nice and soft it's not
particularly<00:00:50.420> light<00:00:51.420> proof<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.170> it's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
particularly light proof but it's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.720 
particularly light proof but it's
interesting<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:54.059> might<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.539> something<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> now

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
interesting it might do something so now

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
interesting it might do something so now
the<00:00:56.789> idea<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.300> somehow<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:59.989> on<00:01:00.989> there

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the idea is to somehow get this on there

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.889 
the idea is to somehow get this on there
like<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:01.980> okay<00:01:02.520> well<00:01:03.180> how<00:01:03.480> hard<00:01:03.660> could<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
like that okay well how hard could that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.649 
like that okay well how hard could that
be<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.379> reach<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> tore<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> hole<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
be I reach in there and I tore a hole in

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.359 
be I reach in there and I tore a hole in
the<00:01:06.900> center<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.409> ear<00:01:07.650> thing<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.310> with

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the center of that ear thing just with

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
the center of that ear thing just with
my<00:01:08.490> fingers<00:01:08.820> shredded<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.510> paper

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
my fingers shredded like paper

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
my fingers shredded like paper
Easy's<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.159> didn't<00:01:11.369> even<00:01:11.490> tear<00:01:12.330> hole<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
Easy's what I didn't even tear hole I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.340 
Easy's what I didn't even tear hole I
just<00:01:14.450> poked<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> hole<00:01:15.689> through<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.080> my

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
just poked a hole through with my

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
just poked a hole through with my
fingers<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.770> razor<00:01:17.430> blade<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fingers and razor blade and just get it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
fingers and razor blade and just get it
on<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> gh2<00:01:20.220> shooter

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
on there if you're a gh2 shooter

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.920 
on there if you're a gh2 shooter
you<00:01:21.000> already<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.600> an<00:01:21.689> improvement

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you already know this is an improvement

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.850 
you already know this is an improvement
in<00:01:22.400> order<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> getting<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:24.119> less<00:01:24.299> light

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
in order to getting a little less light

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
in order to getting a little less light
coming<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.950> from<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> side<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> little

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
coming in from the side it's a little

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.530 
coming in from the side it's a little
more<00:01:27.630> comfortable<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> period<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.540> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
more comfortable for a period of time I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
more comfortable for a period of time I
thought<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.470> got<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.710> some<00:01:31.890> more<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.280> we

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thought it's got to be some more that we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.890 
thought it's got to be some more that we
can<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> took<00:01:33.060> another<00:01:33.329> Sarah

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
can do with this so I took another Sarah

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620 
can do with this so I took another Sarah
headphones<00:01:34.290> similar<00:01:34.890> design<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.630> tried

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
headphones similar design and tried

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450 
headphones similar design and tried
something<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.460> thoughtful

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
something just a little more thoughtful

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
something just a little more thoughtful
and<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.750> basically<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.170> cut<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and what that was was basically to cut a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.030 
and what that was was basically to cut a
circle<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.270> no<00:01:42.270> tear<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> circle<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> then

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
circle out no tear a circle out and then

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.429 
circle out no tear a circle out and then
put<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.420> fit<00:01:45.630> better<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.320> was

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
put it on in that fit better and I was

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.749 
put it on in that fit better and I was
able<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.799> better<00:01:46.920> control<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
able to get better control but then I

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
able to get better control but then I
had<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> idea<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.780> happens<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> turn

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
had the idea what happens if you turn

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.429 
had the idea what happens if you turn
this<00:01:49.860> sucker<00:01:50.130> inside-out<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> end<00:01:52.290> up

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
this sucker inside-out and you end up

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.340 
this sucker inside-out and you end up
with<00:01:52.649> something<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.750> now<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.170> almost

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
with something like that now that almost

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.780 
with something like that now that almost
looks<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.329> shapes<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
looks like up the right shapes it's the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.289 
looks like up the right shapes it's the
right<00:01:59.939> depth

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
right depth

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.060 
right depth
put<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:01.930> there<00:02:02.170> see<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.530> looks<00:02:02.680> like

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
put that on there see what it looks like

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.990 
put that on there see what it looks like
so<00:02:03.280> check<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:06.180> pretty<00:02:07.180> effective<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
so check it out is pretty effective you

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.750 
so check it out is pretty effective you
can<00:02:10.209> see<00:02:10.450> how<00:02:10.630> it's<00:02:10.810> supposed<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.260> work<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
can see how it's supposed to work it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.559 
can see how it's supposed to work it
sticks<00:02:13.090> out<00:02:13.239> pretty<00:02:13.569> far<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:16.150> gives<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
sticks out pretty far and gives you a

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.500 
sticks out pretty far and gives you a
little<00:02:16.780> cushion<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.530> shadow<00:02:17.830> there

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
little cushion a little shadow there

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.940 
little cushion a little shadow there
don't<00:02:19.510> look<00:02:19.690> too<00:02:20.410> ready

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
don't look too ready

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.500 
don't look too ready
it's<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:21.310> even<00:02:21.550> taped<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.880> they're<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.030> set

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
it's not even taped on they're just set

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.020 
it's not even taped on they're just set
on<00:02:22.630> there<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:22.989> friction<00:02:24.000> obviously<00:02:25.000> I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
on there with friction obviously I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.380 
on there with friction obviously I
didn't<00:02:25.239> seem<00:02:25.360> last<00:02:25.630> about<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> day<00:02:26.849> maybe<00:02:27.849> do<00:02:28.150> if

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
didn't seem last about a day maybe do if

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.790 
didn't seem last about a day maybe do if
you're<00:02:28.540> careful<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.489> pinch
