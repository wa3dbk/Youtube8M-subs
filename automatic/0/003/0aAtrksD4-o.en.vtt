00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
mess around with Pegasus vehicles nail

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
mess around with Pegasus vehicles nail
despawn<00:01:28.500> faster<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> player<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.670> owns

because<00:02:59.850> then<00:03:00.690> obviously<00:03:00.900> people<00:03:01.290> know<00:03:01.560> if

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
because then obviously people know if

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.290 
because then obviously people know if

you went off the radar and the whole

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.840 
you went off the radar and the whole
point<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:04.140> let<00:03:04.950> people<00:03:05.010> know<00:03:05.430> but

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
point is to not let people know but

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.700 
point is to not let people know but
we'll<00:03:06.090> see<00:03:06.240> how<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.390> plays<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.110> then

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
we'll see how that plays out and then

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.020 
we'll see how that plays out and then
since<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.160> lasting<00:03:08.580> Stan<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.910> there's

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
since this is lasting Stan and there's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.360 
since this is lasting Stan and there's
been<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> bunch<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.870> last<00:03:10.440> team<00:03:10.710> standing<00:03:10.830> jobs

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
been a bunch of last team standing jobs

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.800 
been a bunch of last team standing jobs
that<00:03:11.610> have<00:03:11.700> been<00:03:11.730> rebalanced<00:03:12.120> with<00:03:12.510> cash<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that have been rebalanced with cash and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.770 
that have been rebalanced with cash and
RP<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> don't<00:03:14.550> know<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.850> they're<00:03:15.210> better<00:03:15.510> or

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
RP so I don't know if they're better or

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.400 
RP so I don't know if they're better or
worse<00:03:15.990> but<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.910> want<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.540> play<00:03:18.810> some<00:03:19.050> less

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
get a little bit more money and RP if

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.040 
get a little bit more money and RP if
you<00:03:23.490> do<00:03:23.610> better<00:03:23.790> now<00:03:24.330> getting<00:03:24.510> into<00:03:24.690> some<00:03:24.959> of

also fixed

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.610 
also fixed
you<00:04:27.060> where<00:04:27.420> players<00:04:27.750> could<00:04:28.080> freeze<00:04:28.410> when

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
you where players could freeze when

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.260 
you where players could freeze when
playing<00:04:28.860> GTA<00:04:29.310> online<00:04:29.340> hopefully<00:04:29.970> they

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
playing GTA online hopefully they

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.700 
playing GTA online hopefully they
actually<00:04:30.600> mean<00:04:30.750> at<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.020> times<00:04:31.290> another<00:04:31.620> they

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
actually mean at this times another they

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.160 
actually mean at this times another they
said<00:04:31.890> in<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> past<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.880> still<00:04:33.210> persists

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
said in the past but it still persists

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.080 
said in the past but it still persists
so<00:04:34.470> hopefully<00:04:34.800> no<00:04:34.950> more<00:04:35.100> freezing<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.790> it

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so hopefully no more freezing and it

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.880 
so hopefully no more freezing and it
seems<00:04:36.270> like<00:04:36.360> with<00:04:36.600> all<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.960> these<00:04:37.050> they<00:04:37.410> fixed

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
seems like with all of these they fixed

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.760 
seems like with all of these they fixed

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
your thoughts on this DLC as a whole

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.610 
your thoughts on this DLC as a whole
pink<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.720> definitely<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.169> better<00:05:04.350> than<00:05:04.500> the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
pink it definitely is better than the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.680 
pink it definitely is better than the
flight<00:05:04.890> school<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.460> mean<00:05:05.910> it's<00:05:06.060> not<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.510> the

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
flight school I mean it's not one of the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.440 
flight school I mean it's not one of the
best<00:05:06.930> but<00:05:07.200> it's<00:05:07.410> it's<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.919> good<00:05:08.190> DLC<00:05:08.700> I'm<00:05:09.150> really

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
best but it's it's a good DLC I'm really

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.670 
best but it's it's a good DLC I'm really
hoping<00:05:09.720> they<00:05:09.840> don't<00:05:09.960> count<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.380> as<00:05:10.560> the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
hoping they don't count this as the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.800 
hoping they don't count this as the
October<00:05:11.160> one<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.580> we<00:05:11.700> don't<00:05:11.910> get<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.210> Halloween

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
October one and we don't get a Halloween

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.390 
October one and we don't get a Halloween
one<00:05:13.020> because<00:05:13.230> I'd<00:05:13.320> be<00:05:13.440> disappointing<00:05:14.040> but<00:05:14.160> I

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
one because I'd be disappointing but I

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.500 
one because I'd be disappointing but I
guess<00:05:14.820> we'll<00:05:14.910> just<00:05:14.940> have<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.180> wait<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.390> see

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
guess we'll just have to wait and see

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.360 
guess we'll just have to wait and see
