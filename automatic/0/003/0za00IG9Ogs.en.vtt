00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
speeds in the winter time so I thought

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.979

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.100 
same taste to it it also has like no
shine<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.420> thought<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:30.750> kind<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:30.989> neat
