pneumatic<00:00:25.350> wheels<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> past<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.260> we

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
pneumatic wheels in the past that we

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
pneumatic wheels in the past that we
tried<00:00:28.830> using<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.849> inner<00:00:30.510> tube

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
tried using the little inner tube

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.920 
tried using the little inner tube
situation<00:00:31.769> over<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> those<00:00:33.149> hard<00:00:33.390> plastic

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
situation over the those hard plastic

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.799 
situation over the those hard plastic
wheels<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.190> seemed<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.420> any<00:00:36.600> kind

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
wheels that seemed to not get any kind

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.740 
wheels that seemed to not get any kind
of<00:00:36.989> grip<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:38.030> was<00:00:39.030> done<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.600> because

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
of grip so I was done with that because

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
of grip so I was done with that because
they<00:00:39.899> only<00:00:40.020> lasted<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.739> while<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.250> now

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
they only lasted a little while and now

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600 
they only lasted a little while and now
it<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.559> they're<00:00:43.559> actually<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.040> pneumatic

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it has they're actually not pneumatic

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.200 
it has they're actually not pneumatic
wheels<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:45.329> tires<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.079> they're<00:00:47.210> they're

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
wheels or tires but they're they're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
wheels or tires but they're they're
solid<00:00:48.750> rubber<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.980> meant<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.789> hand

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
solid rubber that are meant for a hand

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.280 
solid rubber that are meant for a hand
truck<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.730 

okay<00:00:56.290> so<00:00:56.350> for<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.830> front<00:00:57.190> wheel<00:00:57.760> setup<00:00:58.240> as<00:00:58.740> you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
okay so for the front wheel setup as you

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.340 
okay so for the front wheel setup as you
can<00:00:59.890> see<00:01:01.650> there<00:01:02.650> is<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.950> long<00:01:03.540> shaft<00:01:04.540> offset

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
can see there is a long shaft offset

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.160 
can see there is a long shaft offset
that<00:01:05.920> goes<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.400> inside<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.630> then<00:01:07.990> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
that goes to the inside and then the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.940 
that goes to the inside and then the
outside<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:09.010> a<00:01:09.580> flush<00:01:09.970> mount<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.410> existing

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
outside is a flush mount so the existing

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.340 
outside is a flush mount so the existing
spindle<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.670> ended<00:01:13.090> up<00:01:15.600> threading<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.780> outer

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
spindle I ended up threading the outer

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.980 
spindle I ended up threading the outer
spindle<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.190> putting<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.790> nylon<00:01:19.330> stainless

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
spindle and putting a nylon stainless

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.110 
spindle and putting a nylon stainless
nylon<00:01:20.410> locknut<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.580> end<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:21.880> with<00:01:22.090> a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
nylon locknut on the end of it with a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.270 
nylon locknut on the end of it with a
washer<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.320> what<00:01:23.470> you're<00:01:23.650> seeing<00:01:23.920> on<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
washer and what you're seeing on the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.950 
washer and what you're seeing on the
spindle<00:01:24.910> itself<00:01:25.420> is<00:01:26.910> one<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.060> these<00:01:28.180> sleeves<00:01:28.660> I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
spindle itself is one of these sleeves I

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.190 
spindle itself is one of these sleeves I
picked<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.860> up<00:01:29.950> out<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.810> suspension<00:01:31.810> kit

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
picked it up out of a suspension kit

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.990 
picked it up out of a suspension kit
that<00:01:32.380> we<00:01:32.470> did<00:01:32.650> for<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> Chevy<00:01:33.340> pickup<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.820> while

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
that we did for a Chevy pickup a while

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.230 
that we did for a Chevy pickup a while
back<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.200> anyways<00:01:35.530> this<00:01:35.680> was<00:01:35.740> cut<00:01:36.130> down<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
back so anyways this was cut down to the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.530 
back so anyways this was cut down to the
width<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.200> spindle<00:01:38.560> itself<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.540> it's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
width of the spindle itself and it's

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.749 
width of the spindle itself and it's
sleeved<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.560> there<00:01:41.830> so<00:01:42.070> what<00:01:42.430> you're<00:01:42.550> seeing

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
sleeved on there so what you're seeing

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.490 
sleeved on there so what you're seeing
is<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.090> original<00:01:43.509> outer<00:01:43.810> section<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.440> the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
is the original outer section of the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.910 
is the original outer section of the
spindle<00:01:44.950> from<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.390> Power<00:01:46.869> Wheels<00:01:47.110> car<00:01:47.470> and

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
spindle from the Power Wheels car and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.580 
spindle from the Power Wheels car and
then<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.060> inside<00:01:49.450> section<00:01:49.930> where<00:01:50.080> this

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
then the inside section where this

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.790 
then the inside section where this
actually<00:01:51.009> spins<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.520> has<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.509> cut-down<00:01:52.960> slid

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
actually spins on has this cut-down slid

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.520 
actually spins on has this cut-down slid
inside<00:01:54.220> there's<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.119> back<00:01:55.360> washer<00:01:55.810> here<00:01:56.050> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
inside there's a back washer here the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.840 
inside there's a back washer here the
neat<00:01:56.710> thing<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:56.950> adds<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.430> little<00:01:57.520> zerk

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.930 

spins<00:02:08.240> nice<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.690> smooth<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.440> anyway<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.910> that

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
spins nice and smooth so anyway so that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.130 
spins nice and smooth so anyway so that
was<00:02:11.150> done<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.450> both<00:02:11.600> sides<00:02:11.870> on<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:13.370> back

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
was done to both sides on the back

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.830 
was done to both sides on the back
this<00:02:15.140> section<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.310> what<00:02:16.850> slides<00:02:17.209> inside<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
this section is what slides inside the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.210 
this section is what slides inside the
electric<00:02:18.230> motor<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.830> got<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> flat

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
electric motor and it's got a flat

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.410 
electric motor and it's got a flat
flange<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.600> original<00:02:21.250> wheel<00:02:22.250> setup<00:02:22.580> had

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
flange the original wheel setup had

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.570 
flange the original wheel setup had
little<00:02:23.660> grooves<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.530> back<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> wheel

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
little grooves on the back of the wheel

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.800 
little grooves on the back of the wheel
the<00:02:25.790> plastic<00:02:26.319> molding<00:02:27.319> which<00:02:28.420> fits<00:02:29.420> inside

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the plastic molding which fits inside

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.500 
the plastic molding which fits inside
these<00:02:29.959> little<00:02:30.260> grooves<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> ended<00:02:32.390> up

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
these little grooves so what I ended up

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.400 
these little grooves so what I ended up
doing<00:02:32.569> is<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.230> took<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.770> same<00:02:34.160> wheel<00:02:35.020> all<00:02:36.020> four

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
doing is I took the same wheel all four

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.229 
doing is I took the same wheel all four
of<00:02:36.440> these<00:02:36.620> wheels<00:02:36.800> are<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.069> exact<00:02:37.370> same<00:02:37.459> but<00:02:38.209> I

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
of these wheels are the exact same but I

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.449 
of these wheels are the exact same but I
ended<00:02:38.510> up<00:02:38.600> welding<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.910> metal<00:02:40.910> flange<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:42.459> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
ended up welding a metal flange on the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.520 
ended up welding a metal flange on the
back<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.030> then<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.360> tapped<00:02:44.690> threads<00:02:45.110> inside

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
back and then I tapped threads inside

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.850 
back and then I tapped threads inside
the<00:02:45.680> flange<00:02:46.150> set<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> spacer<00:02:47.690> washer<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.320> washer

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
the flange set a spacer washer a washer

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.729 
the flange set a spacer washer a washer
on<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.160> side<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.610> bolted<00:02:50.209> them<00:02:50.300> on<00:02:50.739> so

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
on this side and bolted them on so

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.729 
on this side and bolted them on so
there's<00:02:51.950> four<00:02:52.250> bolts<00:02:52.489> on<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.380> also<00:02:54.380> has<00:02:54.709> a

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
there's four bolts on there also has a

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.770 
there's four bolts on there also has a
zerk<00:02:55.040> fitting<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:56.380> same<00:02:57.380> here<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.780> then

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
zerk fitting in it same here and then

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.810 
zerk fitting in it same here and then
again<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.590> essentially<00:03:01.190> what<00:03:01.550> would<00:03:01.730> be

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
again this is essentially what would be

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.030 
again this is essentially what would be
a<00:03:01.850> full<00:03:02.180> float<00:03:02.540> axle<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.560> same<00:03:03.769> original

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
a full float axle it's the same original

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.610 
a full float axle it's the same original
axle<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.790> was<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.120> there<00:03:05.300> again<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.260> tapped

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
axle that was in there again I tapped

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.580 
axle that was in there again I tapped
threads<00:03:06.980> on<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.280> end<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.690> as<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.989> same<00:03:09.230> metal

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
threads on the end and as the same metal

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.940 
threads on the end and as the same metal
sleeve<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.579> without<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.660> piece<00:03:12.049> here<00:03:12.410> this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
sleeve so without this piece here this

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.670 
sleeve so without this piece here this
spins<00:03:13.489> freely<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.420> with<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.110> puts<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.560> up

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
spins freely but with this it puts it up

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.840 
spins freely but with this it puts it up
to<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.890> motor<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.430> has<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.450> drivability

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
to the motor so it has the drivability

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.560 
to the motor so it has the drivability
so<00:03:19.850> anyway<00:03:20.180> mmm<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.730> stacked<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.850> couple<00:03:23.120> washers

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
so anyway mmm I stacked a couple washers

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.750 
so anyway mmm I stacked a couple washers
I<00:03:23.690> didn't<00:03:23.930> feel<00:03:24.110> like<00:03:24.140> cutting<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.799> spindle

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
I didn't feel like cutting the spindle

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.060 
I didn't feel like cutting the spindle
down<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.810> stacked<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.260> couple<00:03:27.530> washers<00:03:27.920> in

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
down so I stacked a couple washers in

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.960 
down so I stacked a couple washers in
there<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.700> works<00:03:28.910> fine<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:30.549> yeah<00:03:31.549> again

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
there but it works fine and yeah again

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.050 
there but it works fine and yeah again
the<00:03:32.120> long<00:03:32.329> side<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.660> on<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.560> inside<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:35.030> that

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the long side is on the inside so that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.900 
the long side is on the inside so that
your<00:03:35.329> offset<00:03:35.780> is<00:03:36.400> physicians<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.519> wheel<00:03:37.700> and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
your offset is physicians a wheel and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.550 
your offset is physicians a wheel and
tire<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.390> right<00:03:38.570> spot<00:03:38.900> as<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.350> would<00:03:39.530> be

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
tire in the right spot as it would be

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.860 
tire in the right spot as it would be
from<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.040> original<00:03:40.579> set<00:03:40.760> up<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.090> these<00:03:41.810> are

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
from the original set up and these are

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.190 
from the original set up and these are
nice<00:03:42.200> rubber<00:03:43.269> tires<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.750> will<00:03:44.870> get<00:03:44.959> plenty

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
nice rubber tires so it will get plenty

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.069 
nice rubber tires so it will get plenty
of<00:03:45.350> good<00:03:45.470> traction<00:03:46.280> on<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.489> ground<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.930> again

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
of good traction on the ground so again

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:54.009 
of good traction on the ground so again
they're<00:03:48.290> there<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:52.630> wheels<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.840> I

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
they're there it is the wheels that I

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.680 
they're there it is the wheels that I
use<00:03:54.260> just<00:03:54.590> for<00:03:54.739> reference<00:03:56.950> let's<00:03:57.950> see<00:03:58.690> yeah
