two paper towels it only took me two

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.810 
two paper towels it only took me two
minutes<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.840> grate<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.650> potatoes<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
minutes to grate all these potatoes it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.870 
minutes to grate all these potatoes it's
already<00:01:36.240> starting<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> drip<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
already starting to drip so we see it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
already starting to drip so we see it
oxidizing<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> little<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.229> turning<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
oxidizing a little bit it's turning a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.929 
oxidizing a little bit it's turning a
little<00:01:40.740> brown<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> doesn't<00:01:41.700> matter

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
little brown but it doesn't matter

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
little brown but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:43.200> gonna<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.530> fried<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
because it's gonna be fried up and it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
because it's gonna be fried up and it's
gonna<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.549> crispy<00:01:44.880> Brown<00:01:45.090> anyway<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.630> don't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
gonna be crispy Brown anyway so don't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.819 
gonna be crispy Brown anyway so don't
worry<00:01:46.290> about<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> start<00:01:47.909> our<00:01:47.970> oil

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
worry about that time to start our oil

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
worry about that time to start our oil
so<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> pour<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.399> oil<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.659> heat<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.020> at

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so I pour my oil in and I heat it at

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.069 
so I pour my oil in and I heat it at
medium<00:01:52.680> degree<00:01:53.250> heat<00:01:53.600> that's<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.869> bring

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
medium degree heat that's gonna bring

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620 
medium degree heat that's gonna bring
you<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> perfect<00:01:55.649> temperature<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:57.030> 1/2

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you the perfect temperature it's 1/2

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.499 
you the perfect temperature it's 1/2
inch<00:01:58.020> thick<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.890> oil<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.180> me<00:02:00.299> that's

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
inch thick of oil and so for me that's

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.350 
inch thick of oil and so for me that's
about<00:02:00.689> 1<00:02:01.140> cup<00:02:01.469> later<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.670> remove<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.240> I
