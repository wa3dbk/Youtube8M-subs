of<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.920> unicycle<00:03:02.250> okay<00:03:03.180> once<00:03:03.450> you're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
of a unicycle okay once you're

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.210 
of a unicycle okay once you're
comfortable<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.560> next<00:03:04.800> step<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.160> start

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
comfortable the next step is to start

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.430 
comfortable the next step is to start
riding<00:03:05.520> forward<00:03:05.880> step<00:03:06.270> two<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.720> riding

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
riding forward step two is riding

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.960 
riding forward step two is riding
forward<00:03:07.800> let's<00:03:08.010> try<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:10.460> and<00:03:11.460> when<00:03:11.850> you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
forward let's try this one and when you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.460 
forward let's try this one and when you
first<00:03:12.270> start<00:03:12.570> riding<00:03:12.750> forward<00:03:13.080> you're<00:03:13.260> not

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
first start riding forward you're not

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.990 
first start riding forward you're not
gonna<00:03:13.680> make<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.010> very<00:03:14.040> far<00:03:14.460> you're<00:03:14.910> probably

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
gonna make it very far you're probably

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.210 
gonna make it very far you're probably
gonna<00:03:15.240> make<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.690> about<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.200> half<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.680> revolution

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
gonna make it about a half a revolution

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.510 
gonna make it about a half a revolution
but<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.640> should<00:03:17.790> let<00:03:18.060> go<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.920> post<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
but you should let go of the post and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.720 
but you should let go of the post and
just<00:03:21.150> ride<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:22.280> you'll<00:03:23.280> probably<00:03:23.430> fall<00:03:23.670> off

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
just ride and you'll probably fall off

need to learn how to do is how to fall
off<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.850> unicycle<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:40.200> do<00:03:40.350> this<00:03:40.500> all<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
off a unicycle and we do this all the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.220 
off a unicycle and we do this all the
time<00:03:40.800> when<00:03:41.220> we<00:03:41.310> unicycle<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.930> learning

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
time when we unicycle and so learning

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.020 
time when we unicycle and so learning
how<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.500> fall<00:03:43.739> off<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.519> other<00:03:44.700> thing<00:03:44.880> is

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
how to fall off and the other thing is

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.490 
how to fall off and the other thing is
don't<00:03:45.239> worry<00:03:45.480> too<00:03:45.690> much<00:03:45.720> about<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.170> unicycle

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
don't worry too much about the unicycle

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.199 
don't worry too much about the unicycle
if<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.130> let<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.340> fall<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.640> drop<00:03:47.850> it's<00:03:48.060> got

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
if you let it fall and drop it's got

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.820 
if you let it fall and drop it's got
this<00:03:48.330> plastic<00:03:48.570> protection<00:03:49.050> here<00:03:49.350> it's<00:03:49.739> got

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
this plastic protection here it's got

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.530 
this plastic protection here it's got
the<00:03:49.920> plastic<00:03:50.190> protection<00:03:50.459> here<00:03:50.730> they<00:03:51.300> fall

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the plastic protection here they fall

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.120 
the plastic protection here they fall
all<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.690> time<00:03:51.989> they're<00:03:52.200> built<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.830> so

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
all the time they're built to do that so

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
all the time they're built to do that so
it's<00:03:53.670> gonna<00:03:53.790> happen<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.209> lot<00:03:54.390> that's<00:03:54.630> what's

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it's gonna happen a lot that's what's

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.500 
it's gonna happen a lot that's what's
built<00:03:54.989> for<00:03:55.760> scratch<00:03:56.760> up<00:03:56.910> units<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> little

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
built for scratch up units like a little

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.970 
built for scratch up units like a little
bit<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:57.720> alright<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.680> if<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.800> have<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
bit it's alright so if you have a

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.500 
bit it's alright so if you have a
partner<00:03:59.340> who<00:03:59.489> can<00:03:59.519> hold<00:03:59.790> your<00:03:59.970> hand<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.330> let

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
partner who can hold your hand and let

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.600 
partner who can hold your hand and let
you<00:04:00.630> walk<00:04:00.870> along<00:04:01.230> as<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.709> ride<00:04:01.950> that's

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
you walk along as you ride that's

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.160 
you walk along as you ride that's
helpful<00:04:02.940> but<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.420> really<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.780> best<00:04:03.959> way

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
helpful but I think really the best way

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.840 
helpful but I think really the best way
to<00:04:04.200> really<00:04:04.500> train<00:04:04.890> your<00:04:05.160> body<00:04:05.280> train<00:04:05.700> your

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
to really train your body train your

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.910 
to really train your body train your
muscles<00:04:05.940> how<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.269> ski<00:04:06.600> balanced<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.709> just

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
muscles how to ski balanced is to just

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.500 
muscles how to ski balanced is to just
grab<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.160> point<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.730> then<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.269> ride<00:04:09.480> off

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
grab a point and then just ride off

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.180 
grab a point and then just ride off
until<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.110> fall<00:04:10.320> don't<00:04:10.709> you've<00:04:10.860> gone<00:04:10.980> off

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
until you fall don't you've gone off

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.550 
until you fall don't you've gone off
into<00:04:11.370> space<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.820> just<00:04:11.850> fallen<00:04:12.360> you'll<00:04:13.260> start

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
into space and just fallen you'll start

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.620 
into space and just fallen you'll start
to<00:04:13.650> get<00:04:13.739> better<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.459> after<00:04:14.820> falling<00:04:15.060> initially

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
to get better so after falling initially

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.420 
to get better so after falling initially
next<00:04:16.169> thing<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.410> might<00:04:16.590> make<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.950> one

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
next thing you might make it one

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.469 
next thing you might make it one
revolution<00:04:18.230> one<00:04:19.230> there<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.220> one<00:04:20.479> revolution

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
revolution one there is one revolution

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.690 
revolution one there is one revolution
you<00:04:22.049> got<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.289> one<00:04:22.470> revolution

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
you got is one revolution

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.360 
you got is one revolution
and<00:04:25.090> then<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.420> make<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.660> two<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.050> three<00:04:26.370> there

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
and then you make it two and three there

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.400 
and then you make it two and three there
you<00:04:27.430> go<00:04:27.550> faster<00:04:27.970> faster<00:04:28.120> faster<00:04:28.390> faster<00:04:28.540> you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
you go faster faster faster faster you

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.010 
you go faster faster faster faster you
don't<00:04:29.560> want<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.770> go<00:04:29.860> too<00:04:29.920> slow<00:04:30.570> because<00:04:31.570> if<00:04:31.900> you

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
don't want to go too slow because if you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.870 
don't want to go too slow because if you
go<00:04:32.140> too<00:04:32.350> slow<00:04:32.380> it's<00:04:33.190> actually<00:04:33.520> really<00:04:33.700> hard

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
go too slow it's actually really hard

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.670 
go too slow it's actually really hard
even<00:04:34.060> for<00:04:34.210> me<00:04:34.420> as<00:04:34.540> an<00:04:34.660> experienced<00:04:35.050> rider<00:04:35.260> to

faster ready set go there you go yep so

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.050 
faster ready set go there you go yep so
a<00:04:47.260> lot<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.530> people<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:48.130> see<00:04:48.310> with<00:04:48.550> videos<00:04:48.880> they

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
a lot of people you see with videos they

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.000 
a lot of people you see with videos they
show<00:04:49.270> like<00:04:49.540> going<00:04:49.840> along<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.110> fence<00:04:50.350> roof<00:04:50.710> why

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
show like going along a fence roof why

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.010 
show like going along a fence roof why
just<00:04:51.280> prewriting<00:04:52.030> off<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.480> not<00:04:52.570> using<00:04:52.960> a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
just prewriting off and not using a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.780 
just prewriting off and not using a
fence<00:04:53.230> right<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.800> think<00:04:54.250> that<00:04:54.520> when<00:04:54.700> you're

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
fence right so I think that when you're

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.070 
fence right so I think that when you're
when<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.120> hang<00:04:55.300> on<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.660> fence<00:04:55.840> all<00:04:56.020> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
when you hang on to the fence all the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.420 
when you hang on to the fence all the
time<00:04:56.260> you're<00:04:56.470> not<00:04:56.590> really<00:04:56.830> training<00:04:57.310> your

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
time you're not really training your

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.950 
time you're not really training your
muscles<00:04:57.520> as<00:04:57.850> well<00:04:58.030> you're<00:04:58.240> cheating<00:04:58.510> too<00:04:58.780> much

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
muscles as well you're cheating too much

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.990 
muscles as well you're cheating too much
and<00:04:59.230> so<00:04:59.530> your<00:04:59.680> muscles<00:04:59.830> aren't<00:05:00.160> learning<00:05:00.610> how

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
and so your muscles aren't learning how

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.330 
and so your muscles aren't learning how
to<00:05:01.030> how<00:05:01.450> to<00:05:01.480> go<00:05:01.870> forward<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.740> fence<00:05:02.950> will<00:05:03.160> help

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
to how to go forward the fence will help

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.960 
to how to go forward the fence will help
you<00:05:03.490> get<00:05:04.000> up<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.480> it<00:05:04.960> will<00:05:05.110> help<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.790> sit<00:05:06.790> and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
you get up and it will help you sit and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.760 
you get up and it will help you sit and
get<00:05:07.180> comfortable<00:05:07.450> sitting<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.170> if<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:08.620> want

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
get comfortable sitting and if you want

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.960 
get comfortable sitting and if you want
to<00:05:08.860> ride<00:05:08.980> it<00:05:09.100> along<00:05:09.280> there<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.460> little<00:05:09.670> bit<00:05:09.850> to

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
to ride it along there a little bit to

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.010 
to ride it along there a little bit to
get<00:05:10.060> used<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.420> that's<00:05:10.600> fine<00:05:10.780> but<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:10.990> think

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
get used to that that's fine but I think

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.180 
get used to that that's fine but I think
if<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.290> really<00:05:11.560> want<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.770> train<00:05:11.950> your<00:05:12.070> muscles

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
if you really want to train your muscles

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.660 
if you really want to train your muscles
you're<00:05:12.760> better<00:05:12.970> off<00:05:13.180> trying<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.170> failing

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
you're better off trying and failing

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.340 
you're better off trying and failing
then<00:05:15.670> then<00:05:16.090> cheating<00:05:16.510> like<00:05:16.660> that<00:05:16.810> one<00:05:17.200> of<00:05:17.260> the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
then then cheating like that one of the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.570 
then then cheating like that one of the
sakes<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.590> people<00:05:17.890> make<00:05:18.010> a<00:05:18.040> lot<00:05:18.220> when

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
sakes that people make a lot when

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.910 
sakes that people make a lot when
they're<00:05:18.730> riding<00:05:18.910> is<00:05:19.270> they<00:05:19.960> look<00:05:20.140> down<00:05:20.320> when

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
they're riding is they look down when

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.890 
they're riding is they look down when
they're<00:05:21.070> riding<00:05:21.250> they're<00:05:21.640> looking<00:05:22.000> at<00:05:22.330> their

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
they're riding they're looking at their

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.450 
they're riding they're looking at their
feet<00:05:23.140> like<00:05:23.290> that's<00:05:23.590> somehow<00:05:23.800> going<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.070> help

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
feet like that's somehow going to help

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.190 
feet like that's somehow going to help
them<00:05:24.640> go<00:05:24.850> around<00:05:24.970> in<00:05:25.240> circles<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.840> doesn't

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200

that<00:05:43.970> is<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:44.450> annoying<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.320> obviously<00:05:46.250> have<00:05:47.030> a

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
that is so annoying I obviously have a

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.670 
that is so annoying I obviously have a
lot<00:05:47.450> more<00:05:47.480> practice<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.200> do<00:05:48.320> before<00:05:48.590> I<00:05:48.620> can

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
lot more practice to do before I can

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.950 
lot more practice to do before I can
even<00:05:49.430> get<00:05:49.670> close<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:49.970> what<00:05:50.330> these<00:05:50.390> guys<00:05:50.450> can<00:05:50.840> do

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
even get close to what these guys can do

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.810 
even get close to what these guys can do
but<00:05:51.170> if<00:05:51.590> you<00:05:51.740> want<00:05:51.890> to<00:05:51.980> learn<00:05:52.100> more<00:05:52.460> about<00:05:52.580> the

but if you want to learn more about the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.790 
but if you want to learn more about the
science<00:05:53.180> behind<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.570> cycling<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.260> even<00:05:54.500> why

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
science behind you cycling and even why

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.620 
science behind you cycling and even why
people<00:05:55.310> choose<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.580> unicycle<00:05:56.240> with<00:05:56.330> different

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
people choose to unicycle with different
