00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.529
 Brazil has this is our way of 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.330
 playing football is played for clear pleasure 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.300
 that it is clear from the competition that the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.369
 with stern, it's not much sport, but 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.940
 let yourself sport turned this is a 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.940
 celebration of life 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.950
 Miguel is 34 years old and I am 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.920
 completely in love with football 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.590
 I've always been since I can not even remember when 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.260
 started this, I'm not going to stop everything 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.790
 God ended in discussion since 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.680
 represents work and needed 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 working season had a team like 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.520
 business in my head so today I 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.950
 I said I can, I've been like this. 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.950
 fully sleep game knowing that the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.020
 so it's worth it, I'm going to be a very 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 important to me and he was the first 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.060
 person who connects me with football does not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.380
 I'm a fanatic fan and when I was born 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.170
 he was the person who brought the first 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.210
 soccer ball my grandfather during a game 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.430
 I played soccer in Brazil and saw an attack. 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.020
 and was very emotional 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.729
 but he ended up winning the game but that's okay 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.039
 then my uncle also has the same thing 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.479
 which for me has always been a risk because 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.300
 I was also talking about whether they had a 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.190
 heart attack this game is from the game of 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.410
 Brazil, I also have to have a little 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.479
 to keep tradition in the know the family 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.090
 one thing I want my theory to think 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.399
 When are you going to see Brazil? 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.880
 played in the selection the players they have 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.539
 the faces of Brazilians in these 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.009
 faces 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.009
 it was understood in this player 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.140
 no one has that only people we're and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:29.310
 in 'today you had stop this stop is 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:32.640
 the first time the future is 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.860
 property to see the play selection and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.380
 You enter this time for me, it's not 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.610
 superstition knows these things you do 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.310
 before the game 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.319
 taste of your life is what you do have 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.269
 people who call pension for me time 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.000
 You know the day-to-day of things. 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.370
 The Brazilian is pyre expired and the people 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.450
 It gets nights the energy of what can 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.450
 feel a mile away 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.390
 I get desperate I never get nervous 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.390
 was completely desperate 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 because no game is not people 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.300
 understand that the Brazilian sport a 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.040
 ecosport 1 and has nothing to do with it 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.050
 it is another thing a metaphysical question 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.160
 I do not know when Brazil plays from whom. 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.160
 have to give s time 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.250
 My grandmother called from Brazil when she rolled over. 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.829
 a goal has begun to change the brat but who 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.720
 should play yes they knew when the 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.220
 I was on the other side and I 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.110
 he knew that he would find a family of 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.900
 new to a quiet because it was this 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.849
 exaltation of brazilian innocence 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.980
 we know what we had 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.000
 even though something at that moment within the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.000
 brazil marco goals 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.450
 did not have 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.349
 but he did not die 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.269
 evidently neither me nor my uncle than 13 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.329
 the son the heart attack 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.650
 but it happened as it happened for 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.840
 cause of my party because of 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.120
 their emotional investment then part 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.530
 20 education points that will 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 do you explain to accept this is far away 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.680
 affects why you can not participate 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.150
 of great celebrations 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.669
 That's why the boat is here today. 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.800
 has full stadium knows is fundamental to 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.710
 I was a dream franz planted from here 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.419
 youth culture and it is 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.720
 fantastic is what it all means in 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.720
 all
