was<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:03.130> breeze<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.269> actually<00:03:04.480> use<00:03:04.930> when

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
was a breeze and I actually use when

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.930 
was a breeze and I actually use when
Shane<00:03:05.440> moistures<00:03:05.860> mask<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.730> on

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
anti-breakage mask and I think that

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.699
