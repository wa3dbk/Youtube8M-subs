00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:11.599 
hardcore adventure now the only reason I

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.359 
hardcore adventure now the only reason I
can<00:01:11.660> think<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:12.229> how<00:01:12.410> clever<00:01:12.800> not<00:01:13.069> being

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
can think of how clever not being

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.279 
can think of how clever not being
introduced<00:01:14.179> is<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.630> do<00:01:14.810> with<00:01:14.929> the<00:01:15.080> host

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
introduced is to do with the host

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.440 
introduced is to do with the host
options<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:16.399> when<00:01:16.550> someone<00:01:16.759> creates<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.209> world

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
options now when someone creates a world

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.359 
options now when someone creates a world
it's<00:01:17.810> all<00:01:18.050> down<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.560> host<00:01:18.800> if<00:01:19.069> the<00:01:19.190> host

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
it's all down to the host if the host

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.190 
it's all down to the host if the host
leaves<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.759> game<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.420> other<00:01:20.450> players<00:01:20.899> can't

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
leaves the game the other players can't

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.499 
leaves the game the other players can't
continue<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.860> which<00:01:22.399> means<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.060> host<00:01:23.240> did

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
continue it which means if the host did

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.540 
continue it which means if the host did
die<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:23.929> hardcore<00:01:24.349> mode<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:25.039> world<00:01:25.310> would<00:01:25.520> be

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
die in hardcore mode the world would be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.699 
die in hardcore mode the world would be
completely<00:01:26.149> over<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.780> think<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:27.289> is<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.530> only

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 
completely over I think this is the only

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.980 
completely over I think this is the only
reason<00:01:28.190> why<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.369> was<00:01:28.520> never<00:01:28.670> introduced<00:01:29.390> which

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
reason why it was never introduced which

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.809 
reason why it was never introduced which
again<00:01:30.319> leads<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.679> adding<00:01:31.069> servers<00:01:31.459> or

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
again leads to adding servers or

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.550 
again leads to adding servers or
actually<00:01:32.270> having<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.630> option<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.170> keep<00:01:33.349> your

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
actually having the option to keep your

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.010 
actually having the option to keep your
world<00:01:33.739> continued<00:01:34.429> while<00:01:35.000> other<00:01:35.209> players<00:01:35.569> can

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
world continued while other players can

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.630 
world continued while other players can
still<00:01:36.140> enjoy<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.619> even<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> host<00:01:37.310> isn't

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
still enjoy it even if the host isn't

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.729 
still enjoy it even if the host isn't
online<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:38.420> that's<00:01:38.599> number<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:38.959> hardcore

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:39.739 
online so that's number one hardcore

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.070 
online so that's number one hardcore

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.290 
mode and I believe hardcore mode on PC
was<00:01:42.319> introduced<00:01:43.069> when<00:01:43.429> adventure<00:01:43.880> mode<00:01:44.060> was

you go to the nether the mob spawning

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.249 
you go to the nether the mob spawning
rate<00:05:54.460> in<00:05:54.639> the<00:05:54.729> nether<00:05:54.969> is<00:05:55.300> ten<00:05:55.659> times<00:05:55.960> better

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
in the nether than it is in the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.330 
in the nether than it is in the
overworld<00:05:59.289> I<00:05:59.560> don't<00:05:59.800> know<00:05:59.919> if<00:06:00.039> the<00:06:00.159> nether

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.740 
overworld I don't know if the nether
does<00:06:00.580> affect<00:06:00.880> the<00:06:01.000> overworld<00:06:01.389> but

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
does affect the overworld but

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.020 
does affect the overworld but
specifically<00:06:02.289> on<00:06:02.409> Minecraft<00:06:03.039> Xbox<00:06:03.190> one<00:06:03.849> and

PlayStation<00:06:04.090> 4<00:06:04.599> I<00:06:05.050> definitely<00:06:05.500> think<00:06:05.740> it's

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
PlayStation 4 I definitely think it's

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.820 
PlayStation 4 I definitely think it's
able<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.969> cope<00:06:07.210> with<00:06:07.449> infinite<00:06:08.110> spawning<00:06:08.500> if

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
able to cope with infinite spawning if

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.830 
able to cope with infinite spawning if
not<00:06:09.069> definitely<00:06:09.400> triple<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.180> amount<00:06:10.270> of<00:06:10.569> mobs

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
not definitely triple the amount of mobs

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.809 
not definitely triple the amount of mobs
that<00:06:11.080> we<00:06:11.169> are<00:06:11.380> able<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.770> spawn<00:06:12.159> so<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.430> for<00:06:12.669> this

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
that we are able to spawn so I for this

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:14.399 
that we are able to spawn so I for this
video<00:06:13.060> would<00:06:13.659> be<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.840> little<00:06:14.050> bit<00:06:14.169> interesting
