00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.510
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 if you live in asturias it is very very 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.280
 easy that you dedicate yourself to fishing 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 salmon because it's all over 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 the other day I've been with some 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.860
 companions fishing in a preserve 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.360
 wonderful from asturias and I have given 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:31.290
 fishermen realize that a lot of people 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.250
 who are starting do not know how 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.660
 prepare a salmon rig then 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.970
 let's start for now simpler 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.390
 tie a lead 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.420
 for salmon fishing that everything 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.810
 has its secret the lead is a part 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.060
 very important to fish salmon 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.950
 depending on the current you make 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.530
 choose the right lead that will be gone 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.580
 learning with time for now 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 let's put the lead observe that this 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.460
 It is the best way 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 of a lead let's do it with a thread 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.750
 fat for you to see but generally 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:27.080
 a thread is put on 0 18 10 16 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.360
 in case you hit the bottom that breaks and 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.300
 do not lose the rigging but well this is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 just so you can see how it's done 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.210
 truth is to attend is very easy to lead 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.680
 pointing up 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.680
 get the thread here 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.200
 he is removed 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.289
 you give it a spin like that 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.950
 and that lap has returned work to put 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.950
 for the lead 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.780
 another turn 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.810
 you put it back 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.150
 and the little bit that you have left you go back to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.150
 put in here look here 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.100
 strips 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.069
 and it's perfect not those robberies that come 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.079
 working 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.079
 perfect this you cut it 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 you cut it and that in the lead 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.840
 perfectly tied as after seeing
