sketches of earlier and at this process
at<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:13.980> point

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
at this point

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.230 
at this point
in<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.000> mural<00:00:15.240> design<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.520> lay<00:00:17.520> down<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
in the mural design I lay down all the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380 
in the mural design I lay down all the
black<00:00:18.480> paint<00:00:18.779> marker<00:00:19.199> effect<00:00:19.710> there<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.390> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
black paint marker effect there and so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
black paint marker effect there and so
it's<00:00:21.570> pretty<00:00:21.930> much<00:00:22.080> final<00:00:22.439> we'd<00:00:22.800> also<00:00:23.130> final

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it's pretty much final we'd also final

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.640 
it's pretty much final we'd also final
as<00:00:24.180> far<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.660> black<00:00:25.199> part<00:00:25.529> is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
as far as the the black part is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.189 
as far as the the black part is
concerned<00:00:26.099> you'll<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> nice<00:00:27.570> foggy

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
concerned you'll see like a nice foggy

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.650 
concerned you'll see like a nice foggy
hazy<00:00:28.619> effect<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.090> sealer<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.480> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
hazy effect that is the sealer that I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.659 
hazy effect that is the sealer that I
used<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> workable<00:00:32.430> fixative

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
used and it's a workable fixative

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.630 
used and it's a workable fixative
basically<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:34.710> paint<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.340> top<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
basically so I can still paint on top of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.830 
basically so I can still paint on top of
the<00:00:36.360> fixative<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.829> will<00:00:37.980> keep<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.520> black

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
the fixative but it will keep the black

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.990 
the fixative but it will keep the black
where<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> isn't<00:00:40.110> permanent<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
where it isn't permanent so at this

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.470 
where it isn't permanent so at this
point<00:00:42.270> we're<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.989> ready<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.590> lay<00:00:44.100> in

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
point we're just it's ready to lay in

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.569 
point we're just it's ready to lay in

detail it'll be it's almost close to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
detail it'll be it's almost close to
done<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.180> point<00:00:52.430> what<00:00:53.430> depending<00:00:54.000> on

coating on top of that and sometimes

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
coating on top of that and sometimes
we'll<00:01:08.760> also<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.420> take<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:10.020> household<00:01:10.830> regular

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so when you're on the other side of the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.289 
so when you're on the other side of the
window<00:01:15.890> it'll<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> solid<00:01:17.670> color<00:01:17.880> but

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
window it'll just be a solid color but

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.570 
window it'll just be a solid color but
when<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> come<00:01:18.689> outside<00:01:18.900> it'll<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.220> mural

so<00:01:22.130> when<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.369> piece<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.850> completed<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
so when the piece is all completed and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
so when the piece is all completed and
say<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.770> advertisement<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> sale

say it's for an advertisement or a sale
that<00:01:27.630> they're<00:01:27.960> promoting<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> it'll<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that they're promoting so it'll be a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
that they're promoting so it'll be a
temporary<00:01:30.329> design<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.409> said<00:01:31.560> earlier

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
temporary design like I said earlier

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.330 
temporary design like I said earlier
when<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.549> add<00:01:32.790> soap<00:01:33.270> regular<00:01:34.170> dish<00:01:34.770> soap<00:01:34.799> into

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
when you add soap regular dish soap into

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.539 
when you add soap regular dish soap into
the<00:01:35.579> paint<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.540> allows<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.500> remove<00:01:38.070> very

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the paint it allows it to remove very

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
the paint it allows it to remove very
easily<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> razor<00:01:39.780> blade<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.770> they're

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
easily with a razor blade when they're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.389 
easily with a razor blade when they're
ready<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.250> take<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.939> mural<00:01:42.360> down<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.250> with

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
ready to take the mural down so but with

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
ready to take the mural down so but with
this<00:01:44.520> particular<00:01:44.810> mural<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.960> I'm<00:01:46.049> doing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
this particular mural that I'm doing

this particular mural that I'm doing
this<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:47.100> permanent<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:48.060> using

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
this is to be permanent so we're using

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
this is to be permanent so we're using
regular<00:01:49.470> household<00:01:49.890> acrylics<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.579> also

I have that I've been using with this
design<00:01:57.630> we're<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> take<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> off

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
design we're going to take it off
