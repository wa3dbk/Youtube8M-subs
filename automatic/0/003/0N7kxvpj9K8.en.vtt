00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
like it's only did really difference is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719 
like it's only did really difference is
that<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> wired<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.250> better<00:01:08.460> night

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that this is wired as a better night

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.350 
that this is wired as a better night
that's<00:01:09.270> wireless<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> chef's<00:01:10.290> why<00:01:10.799> um

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
that's wireless and the chef's why um

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.320 
that's wireless and the chef's why um
big<00:01:12.360> thing<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> batteries<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.729> right

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
big thing is the batteries in the right

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.429 
big thing is the batteries in the right
ear<00:01:15.509> cuff<00:01:15.780> wait<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.650> bad<00:01:16.860> boys<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:17.369> so

ear cuff wait these bad boys down so

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.109 
ear cuff wait these bad boys down so
another<00:01:19.439> reason<00:01:19.799> why<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.369> headsets<00:01:20.850> are

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
another reason why most headsets are

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.350 
another reason why most headsets are
definitely<00:01:21.960> later<00:01:22.770> than<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> edge<00:01:23.340> labs<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
definitely later than the edge labs but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
definitely later than the edge labs but
uh<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:25.110> quick<00:01:25.259> sound<00:01:25.439> qualities<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
uh really quick sound qualities this is

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.789 
uh really quick sound qualities this is
5.1<00:01:27.030> digital<00:01:27.210> surround<00:01:27.570> home<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.110> 7.10

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
5.1 digital surround home that is 7.10

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
5.1 digital surround home that is 7.10
surround<00:01:29.310> soon<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> big<00:01:30.390> difference<00:01:30.750> but

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
surround soon not a big difference but

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.710

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
here footsteps in front of you or in

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.190 
here footsteps in front of you or in
vacuum<00:03:44.209> louder<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.630> can<00:03:44.750> switch<00:03:44.990> that<00:03:45.140> up

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
vacuum louder you can switch that up

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.730 
vacuum louder you can switch that up
which<00:03:45.890> is<00:03:46.070> kind<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.430> little<00:03:46.520> more<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:48.290> depth

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
which is kind of a little more in depth

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.490
