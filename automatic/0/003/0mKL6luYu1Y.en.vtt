to go for

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.520 
to go for
200<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:13.840> we're<00:02:13.960> going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.140> try<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.290> push<00:02:14.500> a

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
hit by a mortar which is good because

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.120 
hit by a mortar which is good because
they<00:02:55.870> spread<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.500> wipe<00:02:56.740> out<00:02:56.920> all<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
skeletons separately because normally

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.120 
skeletons separately because normally
they'd<00:02:59.050> all<00:02:59.140> attack<00:02:59.380> like<00:02:59.560> one<00:02:59.770> or<00:02:59.890> two<00:02:59.920> at<00:03:00.100> a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
they'd all attack like one or two at a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.920 
they'd all attack like one or two at a
time<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:00.910> when<00:03:01.030> they<00:03:01.150> get<00:03:01.270> hit<00:03:01.510> they<00:03:01.690> spread

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
time but when they get hit they spread

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.620 
time but when they get hit they spread
out<00:03:01.990> they<00:03:02.260> choose<00:03:03.070> new<00:03:03.370> targets<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.060> that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
out they choose new targets and that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.680 
out they choose new targets and that
really<00:03:04.990> helps<00:03:05.490> we<00:03:06.490> are<00:03:06.700> already<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.090> forty-four

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
really helps we are already a forty-four

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.720 
really helps we are already a forty-four
percent<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.380> we're<00:03:08.920> going<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.250> 50<00:03:09.580> here

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
percent and we're going to this 50 here

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.490 
percent and we're going to this 50 here
in<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.880> second<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.480> hopefully<00:03:10.870> as<00:03:11.110> Queen<00:03:11.320> there
