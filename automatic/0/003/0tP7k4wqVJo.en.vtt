00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What if I told you I want to be a writer.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Oh here we go !

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.100
Vera that's no way to find a husband !

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm not getting married.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.480
Not now. Not ever !

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.220
Well that's clear then.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.360
Wordsworth, Shelley

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.980
All these romantics aren't good for you, you know.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720
don't worry. They have very little influence.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500
You must write. Really.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.740
No one has ever said that to me before.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.780
We belong together.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360
My three musketeers and I.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.600
I just heard I got a place at Oxford

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.520
We were born to make a mark on the world

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.480
Edward, my little brother

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.520
suddenly so grown up.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040
He's only eighteen.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300
There are boys from the town, who've already signed up.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.460
How would I look if I'm not among them ?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.580
You've signed up too ?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.800
How many generations get the chance to be involved in something like this.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.100
I am coming back.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.440
There's a call for volunteers.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200
It's as close to him as I can get. I need to be there.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Our generation will never be new again.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.360
Our youth has been stolen from us.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760
this heart

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.520
don't destroy it.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.460
It might be gone already.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.440
Life, love and you.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340
Think what they have meant to me.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520
I won't abandon you.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960
This is my promise to you.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.980
All of you.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440
Let's agree, no more fear.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.508
No more fear.
