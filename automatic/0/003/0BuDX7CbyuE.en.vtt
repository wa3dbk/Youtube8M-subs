00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 one more little tip not to shoot with 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.359
 two opponents you understand that you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.870
 this one is two opponents this is 2 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.510
 whole 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.000
 they have exactly two times more likely to have 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.849
 you must try to kill 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.510
 adversary in an awkward position with 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.800
 shooting and that is when you go out 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.570
 he should be shot with him 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 the position is unprofitable for him 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 Well, for example, you are standing here when occupied 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.779
 plant is on point and you are standing 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 here for example if the opponent runs out 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.640
 on the parapet and he has a little situation 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 unfavorable in the first place it can fall 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 here he has a small platform for 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.570
 firing and especially here the steps you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.480
 standing here you can meet cleanly 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 and shoot at the enemy ie in this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520
 the situation he is out of a comfortable position 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.110
 but I can also tell my little one 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.109
 such a riddle of human psychology 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.840
 says to s that when one is visible 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 the enemy's head to kill the well, it is easier to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.909
 example when a man stands here he 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.610
 can sit up to get up 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.729
 sit down get up but see one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.820
 the head of the enemy that is when it comes out 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.549
 from the terf tunnel and he shoots it when 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 spotlight might just kill him for example the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.470
 when there is one visible opponent 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.600
 it is easier to kill the enemy somehow 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 take the parapet situation the same 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.170
 here you can put the enemy 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 behind these barrels you know what it is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.540
 banal the same situation that is quit 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.400
 going out on the parapet we look hot 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.299
 points of course and that is this one 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.979
 the thing and then comes here those barrels that is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.439
 when you can go out with headlights you can 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.259
 just go out and kill the barrels 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.570
 just knowing the shooting position is necessary 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.380
 understand what you need to look for profitability 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 situations for shooting with an opponent and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.360
 improve your name 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.360
 but as with the help to sdm and with the help 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.799
 firing in positions and practice 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.750
 competitive modes and of course not 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.750
 forget see haze of pro players
