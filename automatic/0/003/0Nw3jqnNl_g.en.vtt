00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.650 
what is he drain woods we'll talk time
players<00:00:59.640> he<00:01:00.500> defender<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.789> longest<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
players he defender the longest about of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.170 
players he defender the longest about of
my<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.589> athletic<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> guess<00:01:05.790> kind<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
my really athletic so I guess kind of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.310 
my really athletic so I guess kind of
oxidant<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.930> shoot<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> ball

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
oxidant me right you can shoot the ball

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190 
oxidant me right you can shoot the ball
knocks<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.070> open<00:01:11.340> shots<00:01:11.869> that's<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> ball

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
knocks down open shots that's the ball

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
knocks down open shots that's the ball
well<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.920> guess<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> does<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:14.939> bit

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
well so I guess it does a little bit

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
well so I guess it does a little bit
everything<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.470> he<00:01:16.530> does<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
everything but I think what he does and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
everything but I think what he does and
muscles<00:01:17.100> he<00:01:17.220> defends<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> did<00:01:19.110> your

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
muscles he defends with what so did your

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
muscles he defends with what so did your
lobbying<00:01:19.619> pay<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.759> lobby<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:23.330> praying
