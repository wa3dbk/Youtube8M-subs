00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.969
 I had only to finish the review of two 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.619
 small new cases from the mountain 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.840
 the biggest trio came to me 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.240
 plus case so you can appreciate 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 I will put the size here land raider 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.440
 well , somewhere a couple of raiders here and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.789
 actually actually fit 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:41.579
 case is about a half times longer than battle 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:44.270
 case on fire he is absolutely the same in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.960
 Differences from the rest of the cases 10:30 loop 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.559
 what's so well worth and can be worn on 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 shoulder straps 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.770
 small clasps from the rest of the cases 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.399
 new ruler is not itching they are made as 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.469
 the old ones here have a weak link when 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.420
 good bang flies goodbye 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:15.079
 be careful here with us actually 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:20.009
 strap on the strap and further waiting for us 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:24.240
 disappointment yes it is the same tray 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.090
 as in other cases, they are here just in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.889
 two times more than the previous battle 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 casey 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:34.560
 I remind you in which they are also just stupid in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.599
 two times more than skirmish and that is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.289
 there are four of them absolutely 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:44.159
 trace storm infantry but no matter how 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.759
 slightly variable but large thumbnails 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.240
 it does not put here is it just 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.750
 possible to move infantry Well we 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.170
 we remember from the last review that you can 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.660
 there market how to put dreadnoughts but in 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.840
 principle if we buy so big 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:07.280
 case, we kind of hope for a little bit 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.170
 that he can be put in poland minky 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.620
 let's try to do here is how we 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.880
 we are able to pull out the middle and now I have 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.970
 there is such a big guy famous my 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.600
 the tractor choir is naturally top already 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.520
 nothing 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:29.989
 cover that is, you can like that 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:32.450
 here do yes here and hump is but it 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.020
 principle, he presses because these 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.660
 we just amortized 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.739
 things and you can bring him enough 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.380
 normal and stand but that's all 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.340
 because well there is a square mink 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:55.750
 Yes and thank God you're square well 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.920
 for example, a scorpion cannot be put here 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.500
 some rip secrets for example on 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.959
 try he just wallows he nothing 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.380
 won't hold because 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.650
 these partitions are not made for but how are you 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.590
 their 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.299
 for riptide it is for such big figures 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.930
 to dissolve will not work only 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.459
 tear off what else are trying for example 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.090
 put 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:27.230
 dragon dragon is generally kind of obvious here 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.870
 no disease that we still have this 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.599
 guy 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 my movie too, so I can endlessly 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.739
 change the cheers that they put in any way 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.099
 will not work and this is the main problem 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.989
 this case he's big but he's just there 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.420
 department 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:50.299
 great imperial guard move on 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:54.799
 a bunch of me and everything he is capable of 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:58.379
 if there were any two such trays 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.700
 two somehow under superheavy there or 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.790
 some other technique would be cool as well 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:11.160
 so well, not very clear just big 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.829
 case under a lot of infantry miniatures another 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.949
 sides can be put in one piece 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:21.389
 infantry to another there are several tanks 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:26.270
 by the way andreyka climb first showed 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:29.580
 the same he then forces not the city 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.560
 shove it is impossible on top of it 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.630
 cover up again if it will be like us 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.120
 did a hyun tractor there him a place 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.569
 will be very simple but it will be next 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:47.389
 scoop 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:51.319
 like this we still have a lot since 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:54.439
 sags too did not do in general for 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.550
 technology heavy for some big 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.849
 miniaturks 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.050
 type ritou davr maler feints and so on 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.349
 this case 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.020
 not created unfortunately in general to me personally 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:09.559
 it seems that Chris site case is not very 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.139
 I understand why you need it because 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:16.699
 big formats so much 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:20.360
 infantry and there we say the market does not need you 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.509
 many models appear the same 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.889
 dragons that need fundamentally 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:30.559
 another form factor for transportation and than 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.769
 more format the more such a model 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:37.189
 here you will not put them, that is why he 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:41.499
 big is not clear so from this threesome 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:46.459
 I might choose all the same battle space 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:50.389
 he will solve specific problems 

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:53.949
 which for which here is a trey of this kind 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:59.709
 best fit but otherwise 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:04.149
 good old fat lie down or down 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:04.149
 copes much better
