00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.120
 I think we all dream about that and I think 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:10.780
 that if your name is mentioned it 's because 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.429
 something are you doing well then 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.030
 and that has to serve me as 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.890
 motivation to give even more for him 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.590
 some feet put on the ground and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.630
 work with great humility and if it comes 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.570
 that called the one that is mentioned to you 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.270
 name is because I think there are people who 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.650
 trust you who have that confidence in 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.480
 you have the ability to 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.250
 respond in case they are needed 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.710
 one of those two lathes that you mention 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.850
 I have not received a call yet 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.850
 neither of the two parties 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.010
 and honestly my head is not in that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.010
 but in my club 100% 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.489
 I have no idea, honestly 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.739
 if that day would come, I would be balls 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.059
 right now I have not even reached that 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.059
 point to think about that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.460
 I have not received a message or 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.950
 or the US line me everyone 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 is free to give his opinion in this case 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 I respect what he thinks 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.210
 I do not like to enter into polemics or 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.619
 contradict what he said one said another me 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.659
 I'm just focused with my team 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.340
 we are focused on doing what 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.310
 ours if the rival thinks that too 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.170
 it's his way of thinking things and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.580
 forward very respectable and I to the team 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.110
 to which I face the encounter of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.710
 ability not and I want to win I know that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 they want to win and for more than 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.970
 have that gratitude for why 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 I spent several years there training 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.950
 the horse I want to win and if in this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.250
 ideologist moment with a rivalry 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 because in my team is the lion and I'm going to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.320
 defend to death this this club yo yo 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.970
 I consider myself to be a long way from 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.390
 learn but neither can I 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.390
 try as a newbie because I think that 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.470
 Well I do not consider myself as 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.150
 I no longer consider myself a novice 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.670
 although I know I 'm missing a long way 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.140
 to travel and endless things for 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 to learn 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.720
 but but well there's my point of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.720
