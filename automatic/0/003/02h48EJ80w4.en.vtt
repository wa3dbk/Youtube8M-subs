uh-huh
but<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.800> gun<00:00:31.949> was

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
but that's just what it is this gun was

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160 
but that's just what it is this gun was
extremely<00:00:32.610> appalling<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> me<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.360> honestly<00:00:33.899> do

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
extremely appalling to me I honestly do

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.959 
extremely appalling to me I honestly do
feel<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> worst<00:00:35.280> gun<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
feel that this is the worst gun in the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.970 
feel that this is the worst gun in the
game<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.230> needs<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.500> definite

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
game and I think it needs a definite

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.639 
game and I think it needs a definite
buff<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.930> when<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.110> looking<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.530> these

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
buff now when first looking at these

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
buff now when first looking at these
stats<00:00:40.829> before<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> even<00:00:41.309> got<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.820> at

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
stats before I even got these look at

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
stats before I even got these look at
this<00:00:42.120> thing<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.510> compared<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this thing I compared to like the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.130 
this thing I compared to like the
Battlelog<00:00:44.250> stats<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> rfb<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.809> basically

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Battlelog stats the rfb and it basically

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
Battlelog stats the rfb and it basically
looked<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> DMR<00:00:47.039> across-the-board<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
looked like a DMR across-the-board it

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.299 
looked like a DMR across-the-board it
does<00:00:48.360> roughly<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> believe<00:00:49.079> 50<00:00:49.440> damage<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
does roughly I believe 50 damage so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
does roughly I believe 50 damage so
knowing<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.300> there's<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.660> whole<00:00:51.870> zero

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
knowing that there's that whole zero

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.160 
knowing that there's that whole zero
percent<00:00:52.860> health<00:00:53.039> bug<00:00:53.280> I'd<00:00:53.850> say<00:00:54.149> 95<00:00:54.719> percent<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
percent health bug I'd say 95 percent of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.260 
percent health bug I'd say 95 percent of
the<00:00:55.260> time<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> kill<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.000> three

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the time when I get a kill it's a three

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
the time when I get a kill it's a three
shot<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.629> kill<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.989> one-shot<00:00:58.920> headshot<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
shot to kill a one-shot headshot is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.740 
shot to kill a one-shot headshot is
generally<00:00:59.879> only<00:01:00.000> gonna<00:01:00.210> happen<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.629> you're

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
generally only gonna happen when you're

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.029

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
many times it takes three hit markers

because<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:19.259> created<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.799> gun<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.880> only

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because they created this gun with only

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820 
because they created this gun with only
ten<00:01:21.299> shots<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> ability<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> use

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
ten shots and the ability for you to use

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.539 
ten shots and the ability for you to use
it<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.040> recon

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it in recon

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.609 
it in recon
honestly<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.479> proper<00:01:24.869> bolt-action<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
honestly the proper bolt-action is

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.780 
honestly the proper bolt-action is
weren't<00:01:25.799> gonna<00:01:25.890> work<00:01:26.100> better<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
weren't gonna work better because it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
weren't gonna work better because it
also<00:01:26.909> has<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.750> where<00:01:27.960> every

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
also has this little thing where every

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
also has this little thing where every
third<00:01:28.860> shot<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.430> deviates<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.119> its<00:01:30.360> original

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
third shot it deviates from its original

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.060 
third shot it deviates from its original
course<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.079> you've<00:01:31.170> seen<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.500> first<00:01:31.710> two<00:01:31.860> shots

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
course as you've seen my first two shots

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.840 
course as you've seen my first two shots
went<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:32.520> there

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
went right there

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.280 
went right there
I<00:01:32.880> should<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.450> even<00:01:33.570> landed<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.049> third

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
I should have even landed that third

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
I should have even landed that third
shot<00:01:34.560> except<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.009> deviated<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.670> where<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
shot except for deviated right where I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
shot except for deviated right where I
wanted<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.450> lucky<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.290> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
wanted to I got lucky right there so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
wanted to I got lucky right there so
this<00:01:38.460> gun<00:01:38.729> deviates<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> third<00:01:39.509> shot<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this gun deviates on the third shot and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
this gun deviates on the third shot and
seeing<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.140> how<00:01:40.229> most<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> time<00:01:40.770> you're

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
seeing is how most of the time you're

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
seeing is how most of the time you're
gonna<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> need<00:01:41.729> three<00:01:42.060> shots<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> kill

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
gonna have to need three shots to kill

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.940 
gonna have to need three shots to kill
the<00:01:42.720> guy<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:42.990> gonna<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.259> crazy<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:43.829> you

the guy it's gonna be crazy so what you
have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.640> while<00:01:45.390> using<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.810> weapons

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
have to do is while using this weapons

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420 
have to do is while using this weapons
you<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> teach<00:01:46.590> yourself<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> pace<00:01:47.250> your

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you have to teach yourself to pace your

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.940 
you have to teach yourself to pace your
shots<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> gotta<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:47.970> pow<00:01:48.210> pow<00:01:48.899> pow<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
shots you gotta go pow pow pow and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.530 
shots you gotta go pow pow pow and
that's<00:01:50.490> how<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> find

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that's how you got to do you got to find

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.760 
that's how you got to do you got to find
the<00:01:51.630> steady<00:01:52.049> reliable

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the steady reliable

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
the steady reliable
I<00:01:52.950> guess<00:01:53.490> rate<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.880> fire<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.509> shots<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
I guess rate of fire for the shots to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
I guess rate of fire for the shots to
take<00:01:55.350> consistent<00:01:55.829> cuz<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.100> spam<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
take consistent cuz if you spam it the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.399 
take consistent cuz if you spam it the
bullets<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.240> gonna<00:01:57.450> fly<00:01:57.630> everywhere

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
bullets are just gonna fly everywhere

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
bullets are just gonna fly everywhere
it's<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.219> those<00:01:59.280> teenage<00:01:59.640> kids<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
you do actually get this thing you also

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.380 
you do actually get this thing you also
need<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.190> get<00:02:57.280> three<00:02:57.490> sniper<00:02:57.730> rifle<00:02:58.120> ribbons

need to get three sniper rifle ribbons

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.750 
need to get three sniper rifle ribbons
too<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:58.810> fairly<00:02:58.990> easy<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.350> do<00:02:59.580> 3-hour<00:03:00.580> 5

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
too so it's fairly easy to do 3-hour 5

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.210 
too so it's fairly easy to do 3-hour 5

c4 kills on on any naval strike map
shouldn't<00:03:03.490> be<00:03:03.550> hard<00:03:03.640> especially<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:04.120> you're

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
shouldn't be hard especially if you're

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.820 
shouldn't be hard especially if you're
just<00:03:04.330> going<00:03:04.510> after<00:03:04.840> all<00:03:05.230> kinds<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.680> different

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
just going after all kinds of different

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.110 
just going after all kinds of different
stuff<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.250> my<00:03:06.430> guess<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.790> don't<00:03:07.000> even

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
stuff and my guess is you don't even

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.930 
stuff and my guess is you don't even
have<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.630> recon<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.709> get<00:03:08.860> just<00:03:09.100> 5<00:03:09.280> c4<00:03:09.550> kills

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
have to be recon to get just 5 c4 kills

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.910 
have to be recon to get just 5 c4 kills
you<00:03:10.060> could<00:03:10.180> probably<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.770> support<00:03:11.770> if<00:03:11.890> you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
you could probably be support if you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.470 
you could probably be support if you
absolutely<00:03:12.340> had<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.760> those<00:03:12.970> things<00:03:13.180> kind<00:03:13.330> of

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
absolutely had to those things kind of

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.230 
absolutely had to those things kind of
get<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.750> little<00:03:13.959> shifted<00:03:14.410> around<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.370> with

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
get a little shifted around but with

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.460 
get a little shifted around but with
using<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.630> weapon<00:03:16.959> at<00:03:17.050> first<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.380> was

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
using this weapon at first I was

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.930 
using this weapon at first I was
extremely<00:03:17.650> hyped<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.160> was<00:03:18.310> excited<00:03:18.550> I'm<00:03:18.820> like

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
extremely hyped I was excited I'm like

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.250 
extremely hyped I was excited I'm like
going<00:03:19.060> eight<00:03:19.239> times<00:03:19.480> for<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.780> maybe<00:03:19.989> make<00:03:20.230> it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
going eight times for this maybe make it

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900 
going eight times for this maybe make it
if<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.860> thing<00:03:21.010> was<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.160> consistent<00:03:21.459> two-shot

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
if this thing was a consistent two-shot

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.220 
if this thing was a consistent two-shot
all-around<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.480> made<00:03:22.630> me<00:03:22.720> be<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> little<00:03:23.140> bit

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
all-around it made me be a little bit

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.500 
all-around it made me be a little bit
easier<00:03:23.530> with<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> 3<00:03:23.950> shot<00:03:24.130> thing<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.420> think

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
easier with the 3 shot thing but I think

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.270 
easier with the 3 shot thing but I think
they<00:03:25.840> need<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.050> beef<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.650> even<00:03:27.070> if<00:03:27.160> it's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
they need to beef this up even if it's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.820 
they need to beef this up even if it's
just<00:03:27.340> an<00:03:27.580> additional<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.150> 1<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.780> 5<00:03:29.230> damage<00:03:29.530> or

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
just an additional like 1 to 5 damage or

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.780 
just an additional like 1 to 5 damage or
something<00:03:30.100> this<00:03:30.190> thing<00:03:30.370> needs<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.640> be<00:03:30.760> a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
something this thing needs to be a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.420 
something this thing needs to be a
little<00:03:31.030> bit<00:03:31.180> more<00:03:31.330> stronger<00:03:31.920> because<00:03:32.920> you're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
little bit more stronger because you're

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.220 
little bit more stronger because you're
gonna<00:03:33.550> see<00:03:33.790> exactly<00:03:33.940> how<00:03:34.420> hard<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:34.870> thing<00:03:35.080> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
gonna see exactly how hard this thing is

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.360 
gonna see exactly how hard this thing is
and<00:03:35.410> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.650> shootin<00:03:35.950> any<00:03:36.100> sort<00:03:36.280> of

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
and if you shootin any sort of

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.830 
and if you shootin any sort of
repetitive<00:03:36.670> nature<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.360> gonna<00:03:37.450> be<00:03:37.630> very

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
repetitive nature it's gonna be very

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.940 
repetitive nature it's gonna be very
very<00:03:38.019> difficult<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.440> found<00:03:38.590> myself<00:03:38.739> getting

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
very difficult I found myself getting

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.430 
very difficult I found myself getting
far<00:03:39.370> too<00:03:39.550> many<00:03:39.670> three<00:03:39.970> shot<00:03:40.150> hit<00:03:40.300> markers<00:03:40.660> and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
far too many three shot hit markers and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.990 
far too many three shot hit markers and
it<00:03:41.560> was<00:03:41.709> just<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.100> was<00:03:42.130> painful<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.670> use<00:03:42.850> this

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
it was just it was painful to use this

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.030 
it was just it was painful to use this
weapon<00:03:43.180> knowing<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.630> only<00:03:43.750> got<00:03:43.989> 10<00:03:44.230> shots<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
weapon knowing it only got 10 shots the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.280 
weapon knowing it only got 10 shots the
bullet<00:03:45.340> deviates<00:03:45.700> Vishu<00:03:46.030> too<00:03:46.180> fast<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:47.080> just

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
bullet deviates Vishu too fast it's just

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.479 
bullet deviates Vishu too fast it's just
not<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.470> weapon<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:47.980> would<00:03:48.100> ever<00:03:48.250> recommend

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
not a weapon that I would ever recommend

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.830 
not a weapon that I would ever recommend
anybody<00:03:48.910> using<00:03:49.239> I've<00:03:49.360> already<00:03:49.540> hit<00:03:49.630> him<00:03:49.720> twice

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
anybody using I've already hit him twice

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840 
anybody using I've already hit him twice
and<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.140> got<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> 95<00:03:50.709> assist<00:03:51.070> right<00:03:51.190> there<00:03:51.400> that's

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.220 
exactly what I'm talking about so I
think<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.420> gun<00:03:55.540> is<00:03:55.660> very<00:03:55.840> very<00:03:56.019> challenging

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
think the gun is very very challenging

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.990 
think the gun is very very challenging
it's<00:03:56.680> not<00:03:56.860> worth<00:03:57.040> your<00:03:57.160> time<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.400> even<00:03:57.790> unlock

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
it's not worth your time to even unlock

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.759 
it's not worth your time to even unlock
until<00:03:58.480> they<00:03:58.570> actually<00:03:58.690> buff<00:03:59.049> this<00:03:59.260> up<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.590> mean

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
until they actually buff this up I mean

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.229 
until they actually buff this up I mean
it<00:03:59.890> could<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.160> handful<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.820> other<00:04:00.940> bugs

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
it could be a handful of other bugs

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:01.949 
it could be a handful of other bugs
going<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.630> with<00:04:01.780> it

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
going on with it

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.140 
going on with it
but<00:04:02.560> compared<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.280> having<00:04:03.430> like<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.820> goal<00:04:04.000> or

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
but compared to having like the goal or

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.280 
but compared to having like the goal or
something<00:04:04.450> like<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.630> which<00:04:04.959> can<00:04:04.989> actually

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
something like that which can actually

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.930 
something like that which can actually
kill<00:04:05.650> people<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:06.010> close<00:04:06.160> quarters<00:04:06.549> this

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
kill people in close quarters this

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.340 
kill people in close quarters this
really<00:04:07.209> has<00:04:07.330> no<00:04:07.510> place<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.019> recon

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
really has no place in the recon

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.289 
really has no place in the recon
category<00:04:08.920> because<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.910> we're<00:04:10.030> gonna<00:04:10.120> be

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
category because if we're gonna be

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.000 
category because if we're gonna be
honest<00:04:10.690> about<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.110> DMR's<00:04:11.590> are<00:04:11.709> gonna<00:04:11.799> out

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
honest about it the DMR's are gonna out

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.340 
honest about it the DMR's are gonna out
kill<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.000> gun<00:04:13.239> even<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.049> some<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.260> the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
kill this gun even with some of the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.570 
kill this gun even with some of the
shorter<00:04:14.590> range<00:04:14.769> scopes<00:04:15.010> even<00:04:15.280> with<00:04:15.400> long

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
shorter range scopes even with long

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.360 
shorter range scopes even with long

range and upon that the sniper rifles

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.650 
range and upon that the sniper rifles
are<00:04:18.519> gonna<00:04:18.640> actually<00:04:18.850> be<00:04:19.060> able<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.269> kill<00:04:19.450> in

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
are gonna actually be able to kill in

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.270 
are gonna actually be able to kill in
faster<00:04:20.080> time<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.410> close<00:04:20.560> quarters<00:04:20.890> even<00:04:21.190> if

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
faster time in close quarters even if

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.520 
faster time in close quarters even if
even<00:04:21.760> if<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.300> know<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.479> miss<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.810> few<00:04:23.050> shots<00:04:23.229> so

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
even if you know you miss a few shots so

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.500 
even if you know you miss a few shots so
the<00:04:24.250> awkward<00:04:24.550> moment<00:04:24.849> when<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.030> bold<00:04:25.180> actions

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
the awkward moment when the bold actions

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.590 
the awkward moment when the bold actions
even<00:04:25.660> four<00:04:25.840> are<00:04:25.900> bad<00:04:26.020> players

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
even four are bad players

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.210 
even four are bad players
a<00:04:26.630> more<00:04:27.080> logical<00:04:27.230> choice<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.680> use<00:04:27.950> than<00:04:28.130> this

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
a more logical choice to use than this

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.770 
a more logical choice to use than this
weapon<00:04:28.520> in<00:04:28.610> close<00:04:28.760> quarters<00:04:29.090> medium<00:04:29.420> quarters

kind of spreading awareness that this
gun<00:04:36.170> is<00:04:36.200> definitely<00:04:36.710> not<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.890> good<00:04:37.130> weapon<00:04:37.340> a
