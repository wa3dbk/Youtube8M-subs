00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
music it was made known to me very early

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.350 
music it was made known to me very early
on<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.620> it<00:01:06.040> was<00:01:06.160> Mark<00:01:06.460> Gershwin's<00:01:06.880> desire

that the piano be made playable and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.400 
that the piano be made playable and

available to faculty students to perform

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.580 
available to faculty students to perform
so<00:01:12.280> that's<00:01:13.120> when<00:01:13.420> we<00:01:13.600> got<00:01:13.780> into<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:14.260> question

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
so that's when we got into this question

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
so that's when we got into this question
of<00:01:15.010> how<00:01:15.760> do<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:16.030> restore<00:01:16.270> this<00:01:16.630> instrument

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440 

immediately<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.280> knew<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.909> sound<00:01:24.330> board

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
immediately we knew that the sound board

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
immediately we knew that the sound board
would<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.990> replaced<00:01:25.260> because<00:01:25.770> there

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
would have to be replaced because there

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.219 
would have to be replaced because there
was<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> huge<00:01:27.180> crack<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.810> through<00:01:28.050> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
was a huge crack going through the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
was a huge crack going through the
original<00:01:28.440> sound<00:01:28.860> board<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.479> underneath<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
original sound board and underneath the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.200 
original sound board and underneath the
base<00:01:30.780> bridges<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.710> sort<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.010> thing<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
base bridges and that sort of thing so

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.480 
base bridges and that sort of thing so
it<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.510> clearly<00:01:33.840> irreparable<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.040> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it was clearly irreparable and so we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.150 
it was clearly irreparable and so we
made<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:36.000> early<00:01:36.270> decision<00:01:36.600> first<00:01:37.050> of<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.350> not

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
made an early decision first of all not

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.800 
made an early decision first of all not
to<00:01:38.369> refinish<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.000> instrument<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.540> we

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to refinish the instrument because we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
to refinish the instrument because we
wanted<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.110> still<00:01:40.440> look<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.160> piano<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
wanted to still look like the piano that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
wanted to still look like the piano that
he<00:01:41.729> worked<00:01:41.940> on<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:43.410> we<00:01:43.560> sent<00:01:43.800> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
he worked on and when we sent this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
he worked on and when we sent this
instrument<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> piano<00:01:44.790> crafters<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> sent<00:01:45.930> to

notes<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.230> helps<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.310> quick<00:02:17.550> action

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
notes it helps to have the quick action

notes it helps to have the quick action
that<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.209> piano<00:02:18.540> has<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.380> lot<00:02:19.800> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that this piano has because a lot of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.190 
that this piano has because a lot of
pianos<00:02:20.239> quite<00:02:21.239> frankly<00:02:21.600> aren't<00:02:21.840> able<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
pianos quite frankly aren't able to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.440 
pianos quite frankly aren't able to
handle<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.739> piece<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.670> piano<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.300> can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
handle this piece on this piano I can

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.020 
handle this piece on this piano I can
execute<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.950> fairly<00:02:26.459> with<00:02:26.730> ease

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
execute that with fairly with ease

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.030 
execute that with fairly with ease
versus<00:02:27.690> other<00:02:27.810> pianos<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.530> almost<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:28.920> I'm

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
versus other pianos it's almost like I'm

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560 
versus other pianos it's almost like I'm
fighting<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.730> instrument<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.299> that

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
fighting with the instrument in that

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.020 
fighting with the instrument in that
sense<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.519> one<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
sense it's really one of the one of the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.060 
sense it's really one of the one of the
best<00:02:33.299> instruments<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.930> played<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.769> it's

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
best instruments that played on and it's

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.580 
best instruments that played on and it's
only<00:02:35.310> six<00:02:36.030> foot<00:02:36.209> four<00:02:36.450> yeah<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.019> sounds<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
only six foot four yeah it sounds like a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.140 
only six foot four yeah it sounds like a
nine<00:02:37.920> foot<00:02:38.220> sound<00:02:38.489> way<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.790> concert<00:02:39.120> hall

nine foot sound way in a concert hall
the<00:02:42.150> true<00:02:42.450> soul<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.049> piano<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.530> rim

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the true soul of the piano is the rim

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.569 
the true soul of the piano is the rim
it's<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.940> case<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.860> soundboard<00:02:47.310> just

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
it's the case and the soundboard just

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.610 
it's the case and the soundboard just
represents<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> heart<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> piano<00:02:49.049> even

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
represents the heart of the piano even

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
represents the heart of the piano even
with<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.799> brand-new<00:02:50.130> board<00:02:50.600> those<00:02:51.600> pianos

with a brand-new board those pianos
still<00:02:52.470> sound<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.239> era<00:02:54.480> from<00:02:54.810> which<00:02:54.959> they

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
still sound like the era from which they

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.360 
still sound like the era from which they
came

will develop in conjunction with the
Gershwin<00:03:19.090> initiative<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:21.700> George

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
Gershwin initiative it's George

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.390 
Gershwin initiative it's George
Gershwin's<00:03:22.450> pian<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:23.110> has<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.470> same<00:03:23.739> sound<00:03:24.069> if

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
Gershwin's pian it has the same sound if

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.699 
Gershwin's pian it has the same sound if
not<00:03:24.640> better<00:03:24.879> than<00:03:25.150> when<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.569> was<00:03:25.599> brand<00:03:25.900> new<00:03:26.049> it

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
not better than when it was brand new it

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.039 
not better than when it was brand new it
still<00:03:27.010> sounds<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.519> 1933<00:03:28.209> Steinway<00:03:28.810> long

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
still sounds like a 1933 Steinway long

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.770 
still sounds like a 1933 Steinway long
egg<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:30.370> still<00:03:30.790> sounds<00:03:31.150> like<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.390> panel<00:03:31.720> I

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
egg and it still sounds like the panel I

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.059 
egg and it still sounds like the panel I
believe<00:03:32.049> George<00:03:32.230> Gershwin<00:03:32.769> would<00:03:32.950> have

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
believe George Gershwin would have

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.700 
believe George Gershwin would have
fallen<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.519> love<00:03:33.549> with
