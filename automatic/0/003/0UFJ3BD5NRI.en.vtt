 will experience some kind of enthusiasm 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 joy but the main thing is not to forget September 1 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 do important things we had already video 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.820
 about what you need what to do 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.879
 myself September 1, I want this year 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.420
 remind to give a few really 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.600
 valuable tips 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 First advice is, would you like to think 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 do you want to be 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.619
 elder is usually solved either 1 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.799
 September or in the very first days 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.750
 this is a question for many so important to her 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.000
 I know that there are such ambitious people 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.369
 people who want to be there the most 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 chief know the organizers are so eternal 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.560
 or responsible especially in general 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.020
 Think whether you want to be an old steam 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 if you want then September 1st is the one 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 the day you actually need to manifest 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.360
 you need yourself as you know, but really 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 business 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.549
 I'll tell you a secret that those here 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.799
 elders who appear on the course this 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.869
 usually those people who have proven themselves more 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.750
 until the first of September that is, they are there 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.840
 actively goes to the reception committee there with 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.090
 they all know each other usually 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.220
 any teachers in advance or 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.990
 familiar with the curator of the course in general 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.770
 if you know that you are the same person 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.719
 you need to be fully armed on September 1 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.969
 how not to miss that moment when 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.159
 ask who wants to be a warden 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.680
 scary it is usually here somewhere there at 1 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.110
 lex 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.230
 first lesson the next moment is 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 concerns again repeat the textbooks and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.330
 we have said more than once but the textbooks are 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.510
 very important usually in public 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.940
 universities give textbooks in the library and you 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.060
 take it yourself but as you know in 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.570
 library in the first place is not always all 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.240
 there are enough books and not always books 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.430
 good quality so the sooner you 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.800
 come to the library if you will 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.959
 first who will come library first 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.910
 you will save downtime in the queue 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.830
 secondly you take all the books and they 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.800
 will be new better quality 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.450
 so find out in advance where the very same 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.380
 library in which you will need 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 then take the books and run straight there like 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.860
 only you will end first 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.730
 introductory words next moment not 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.830
 forget to take 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.900
 find out where to get a student card 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.200
 because clinical would yo it now 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.300
 your student passport will help 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.670
 you go inside your institute 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.130
 university and student card will give 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.200
 still a lot of all sorts of useful or year 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.230
 such as discounts in the museum 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.510
 discounts in the cafe and well , just like 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.580
 identity cards at different 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.459
 situations when necessary 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.170
 the next moment you will know how you can 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.830
 get a reduced fare 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.530
 all students who study 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.290
 state universities as private nu 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.180
 on Mr. specify they have the right 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.700
 preferential fare that is you can 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.800
 very cheap ride the subway and very ears 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.560
 rides the bus i'll tell you what it is 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.510
 weighing and yes and now just with such 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.390
 big up for auction and remember those times 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.360
 when i had my student 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.850
 the ticket he was so cheap that 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.040
 when I later left the institute and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.230
 I began to work I felt all this 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.470
 delight whether year that is there just in 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.720
 many times cheaper you drive than on 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.390
 ordinary people buy there six already at home 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.910
 how much 50 rubles in general is very expensive 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.739
 worth the trip so use 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.080
 Be sure to use all the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.370
 next moment and last on 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.320
 today's video is right away 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.419
 try to make friends because 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.669
 here is the first of September I have here as far as I 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.400
 I remember I studied with me two higher 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.810
 education and then later but where did I get 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.850
 here in these student groups 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.729
 initially you know something like this happens 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.400
 what did you meet with on september 1st 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.440
 wall and friends well from this of course 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 there are exceptions happen so then 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.360
 people somehow converge but just like that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.330
 you know when some kind of friendship 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.450
 so many years she is born 1 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.729
 September and it is strange but it is a fact 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.740
 people you see those people with 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.440
 which you sit next those people with 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.320
 who you will meet on September 1 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.250
 will be your friends for the coming years 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.039
 so this is enough 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.810
 crucial moment and it is clear that you 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.240
 no need to go looking for these friends 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.039
 but somehow prepare to ensure that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.870
 be friendly be open and 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.669
 understand that here's an hour 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.950
 You will get to know the topic later 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.490
 spend a lot of time possible 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.900

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.940
 friends was glad to do this for you 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.039
 video because for me always 1 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.960
 September is a joyful day and despite 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.229
 the fact that now is not where the new part 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.600

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.720

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.850

 institute schoolchildren go to school on 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.840
 school students honestly say not so happy 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.750
 because it seems to me that the school does not 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.760
 so everything is interesting and fun as in 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.780
