00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
right leg pulling down we'll see more of

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.910 
right leg pulling down we'll see more of
that<00:03:46.900> here<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.230> second<00:03:47.500> I'm<00:03:47.590> gonna<00:03:47.740> paint

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
that here in a second I'm gonna paint

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.890 
that here in a second I'm gonna paint
these<00:03:48.040> with<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:50.459> alright<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.570> here<00:03:52.750> we<00:03:52.870> are

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
these with that alright so here we are

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.960 
these with that alright so here we are
standing<00:03:53.410> here<00:03:53.590> kind<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.580> move<00:03:54.820> around

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
standing here kind of you move around

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.410 
standing here kind of you move around
while<00:03:55.450> we<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:57.550> here<00:03:57.730> I'm<00:03:57.820> accelerating

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
while we you see here I'm accelerating

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.900 
while we you see here I'm accelerating
and<00:03:58.780> my<00:03:58.840> right<00:03:59.140> leg<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.650> blowing<00:04:00.550> obviously

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
and my right leg is blowing obviously

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.759 
and my right leg is blowing obviously
with<00:04:01.030> my<00:04:01.120> Jets<00:04:01.360> wanting<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.959> go<00:04:02.050> forward<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
with my Jets wanting to go forward and

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.630 
with my Jets wanting to go forward and
up<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.450> lift<00:04:05.050> shifting<00:04:05.769> my<00:04:05.890> weight<00:04:05.920> slightly

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
up so lift shifting my weight slightly

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.670 
up so lift shifting my weight slightly
to<00:04:07.090> one<00:04:07.120> side<00:04:07.300> will<00:04:07.959> release<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.500> pressure

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
to one side will release the pressure

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.759 
to one side will release the pressure
from<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:09.100> foot<00:04:09.550> allowing<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.450> move

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
from that foot allowing it to move

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.290 
from that foot allowing it to move
there's<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.860> lot<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.100> weight<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.250> there<00:04:12.550> so<00:04:12.820> you

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
there's a lot of weight on there so you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.850 
there's a lot of weight on there so you
got<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.570> kind<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.780> wiggle<00:04:14.050> your<00:04:14.320> left<00:04:14.590> analog

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
got to kind of wiggle your left analog

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.580 
got to kind of wiggle your left analog
stick<00:04:15.299> shift<00:04:16.299> your<00:04:16.479> weight<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:17.169> looks<00:04:17.350> kind<00:04:17.560> of

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
stick shift your weight it looks kind of

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.140 
stick shift your weight it looks kind of
awkward<00:04:17.680> until<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.280> get<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.489> hang<00:04:18.519> of<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.910> I'm

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
awkward until you get the hang of it I'm

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.789 
awkward until you get the hang of it I'm
still<00:04:19.540> kind<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.900> practicing<00:04:20.380> with<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
still kind of practicing with it

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.770 
still kind of practicing with it
and<00:04:21.430> he<00:04:21.549> asked<00:04:21.700> but<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.000> still<00:04:22.150> works<00:04:23.100> anyway

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
and he asked but it still works anyway

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.690 
and he asked but it still works anyway
right<00:04:25.780> trigger<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.560> left<00:04:26.770> trigger<00:04:26.979> right

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
right trigger of left trigger right

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.190 
right trigger of left trigger right
trigger<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.500> left<00:04:29.500> trigger<00:04:30.840> cache<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.169> a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
trigger and left trigger cache it to a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.340 
trigger and left trigger cache it to a
board<00:04:32.590> kind<00:04:32.890> of<00:04:32.950> push<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.400> weight<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.850> know

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
board kind of push that weight you know

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.680 
board kind of push that weight you know
move<00:04:35.350> it

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
move it

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.260 
move it
and<00:04:37.590> that's<00:04:38.250> pretty<00:04:38.370> much<00:04:38.520> how<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.760> get<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.090> walk

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
and that's pretty much how I get to walk

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.020 
and that's pretty much how I get to walk
it<00:04:39.870> does<00:04:40.200> like<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.650> go<00:04:40.770> pigeon-toed<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.640> don't

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
it does like to go pigeon-toed I don't

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.740 
it does like to go pigeon-toed I don't
know<00:04:42.240> why<00:04:42.510> I'm<00:04:42.960> trying<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.590> work<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:43.950> that<00:04:44.160> but

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
know why I'm trying to work on that but

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.560 
know why I'm trying to work on that but
doing<00:04:45.750> all<00:04:45.810> right<00:04:45.840> here<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:47.550> change<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.300> design

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
doing all right here I change to design

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.030 
doing all right here I change to design
the<00:04:48.720> foot<00:04:48.930> kind<00:04:49.170> of<00:04:49.290> make<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.440> look<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.860> little

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
the foot kind of make it look a little

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.540 
the foot kind of make it look a little
less<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.430> see<00:04:50.610> here<00:04:50.820> we<00:04:50.880> got<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.750> point<00:04:52.110> toes

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
less you see here we got to point toes

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.090 
less you see here we got to point toes
taken<00:04:53.550> out<00:04:53.700> but<00:04:54.620> anyway<00:04:55.620> that's<00:04:55.920> basically<00:04:56.370> it

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
taken out but anyway that's basically it

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.680 
taken out but anyway that's basically it
everything<00:04:59.100> else<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.370> up<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.760> you<00:05:00.000> can

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
everything else is up to you you can

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.400 
everything else is up to you you can
make<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.140> better

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
make it better

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.380 
make it better
walking<00:05:01.920> vehicle<00:05:02.310> this<00:05:02.490> one's<00:05:02.730> more<00:05:03.030> for
