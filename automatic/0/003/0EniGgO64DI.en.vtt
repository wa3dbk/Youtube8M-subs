00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.090
 now we know how to code 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.550
 polista how to create codes those that 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.730
 emerge from the data but the next 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.530
 step how can we check the appointments 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.030
 linked to the codes 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.730
 we can do it in two ways 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 through the appointment manager if 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.280
 we click the administrator opens 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 of quotes we have on the side 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.670
 left of the administrator codes 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.880
 and all appointments with your id and specific 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.040
 right then I do want to review 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.800
 the citations of a code for example as 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.100
 construction we click on the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 code and it shows me the three appointments 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.120
 associated with this code I can 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.500
 select the first appointment 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.010
 double click brings me to the context I can 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.920
 read it reflect or write a memo to 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.460
 respect we are going to double click on 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 another appointment again brings us the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.780
 context and finally we also review 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.000
 this appointment so a way to review 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.750
 appointments is through the administrator 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 dating 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.030
 but I also want to present another 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.310
 way to review appointments through the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.979
 Manager codes 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.579
 where a click on the administrator 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.579
 of codes 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 and if I wanted to review the tapes of 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:59.230
 services double click on the code 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.710
 services and I visualized the eight appointments 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.250
 it takes the context automatically to me 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.490
 teaches the 8 quotes associated with this 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.280
 code 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.280
 again we can review it 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.960
 even if they wanted to generate a report 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.060
 and say good I do not want to review this 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.430
 mode if I do not want to print a first 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.270
 simple report go to spend it 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.390
 quietly in a single document in 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.870
 this case selects the button code 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.950
 right print 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.250
 quotes from the selected code quotes from 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.720
 selected code I decide if I want 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.330
 include even editor comments 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.269
 ok and we have a first report 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.300
 simple where we can visualize the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:59.990
 eight appointments of the single room code 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.620
 we can review it see it analyze or 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.620
 play
