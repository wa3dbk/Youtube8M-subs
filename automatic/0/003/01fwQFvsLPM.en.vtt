batteries the client is up to go wed
acid<00:00:39.000> batteries<00:00:39.420> we're<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
acid batteries we're going to get the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.040 
acid batteries we're going to get the
sealed<00:00:40.290> battery<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:43.460> we<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.780> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
sealed battery so we go in this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
sealed battery so we go in this
applications<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.640> other<00:00:47.820> thing<00:00:47.940> we're

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
applications now the other thing we're

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
applications now the other thing we're
doing<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:51.500> I'm<00:00:52.500> siphoning

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
doing right now is we are I'm siphoning

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.060 
doing right now is we are I'm siphoning
out<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:54.000> diesel<00:00:54.180> fuel<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.500> took<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> fuel

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
out with diesel fuel so we took the fuel

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.360 
out with diesel fuel so we took the fuel
pump<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.559> gizmo<00:00:58.770> here

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.979 

you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> fuel<00:01:03.300> pump<00:01:03.449> that's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you can see this is the fuel pump that's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.370 
you can see this is the fuel pump that's
what<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.290> looks<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> diesel

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
what it looks like a diesel

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.469 
what it looks like a diesel
and<00:01:06.799> that's<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.549> float<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.060> tells<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.360> how

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
and that's the float that tells it how

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.740 
and that's the float that tells it how
much<00:01:08.600> gas<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:08.869> in<00:01:09.079> there<00:01:09.380> okay<00:01:10.360> diesel<00:01:11.360> and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
much gas is in there okay diesel and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.020 
much gas is in there okay diesel and
then<00:01:12.380> that's<00:01:13.009> how<00:01:13.130> we're<00:01:13.310> filtering<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:13.909> out

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
then that's how we're filtering it out

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.399 
then that's how we're filtering it out
so<00:01:14.210> we're<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.390> siphoning<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> off<00:01:15.229> the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
so we're just siphoning it off the

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.800 
so we're just siphoning it off the
bottom<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:17.119> can<00:01:17.270> see<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.479> goes<00:01:17.630> right

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
bottom and you can see it goes right

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.649 
bottom and you can see it goes right
down<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.530> here<00:01:18.829> into<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.340> tank<00:01:19.579> so<00:01:20.210> I'm

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
down and here into the tank so I'm

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.370 
down and here into the tank so I'm
pretty<00:01:20.840> happy<00:01:20.960> with<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.860> far<00:01:23.380> checking

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
pretty happy with this so far checking

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.319 
pretty happy with this so far checking
here<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.710> see<00:01:24.920> how<00:01:25.039> much<00:01:25.250> did<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:26.090> lot<00:01:26.210> of

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
here to see how much did that a lot of

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.230 
here to see how much did that a lot of
room<00:01:26.479> in<00:01:26.509> there<00:01:26.720> still<00:01:27.880> takes<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.970> little<00:01:29.090> bit

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
room in there still takes a little bit

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.690 
room in there still takes a little bit
of<00:01:29.299> time<00:01:29.539> to<00:01:30.170> do<00:01:30.319> these<00:01:30.470> these<00:01:30.710> are<00:01:30.770> all<00:01:30.979> let's

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
of time to do these these are all let's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370 
of time to do these these are all let's
both<00:01:32.119> viet<00:01:32.390> minh<00:01:32.539> you<00:01:32.960> can<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:33.289> you<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
both viet minh you can see you a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.149 
both viet minh you can see you a
leftover<00:01:33.799> from<00:01:34.159> recycle<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
leftover from recycle and here is the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.960 
leftover from recycle and here is the
back<00:01:37.909> side<00:01:38.149> of<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.770> diesel<00:01:40.130> motor<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:40.819> can

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
back side of the diesel motor so you can

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.270 
back side of the diesel motor so you can
see<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:41.299> a<00:01:41.390> very<00:01:41.420> large<00:01:41.950> 6.2<00:01:42.950> liter<00:01:43.189> i

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
see it's a very large 6.2 liter i

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.100 
see it's a very large 6.2 liter i
believe<00:01:43.670> that's<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.119> pretty<00:01:44.390> large<00:01:45.939> diesel<00:01:47.110> so

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
believe that's a pretty large diesel so

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.240 
believe that's a pretty large diesel so
right<00:01:48.349> down<00:01:48.500> there<00:01:48.679> is<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.890> transmission

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
right down there is the transmission

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.889 
right down there is the transmission
we're<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.849> get<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.000> brand-new<00:01:50.330> transfer

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
we're going to get a brand-new transfer

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.679 
we're going to get a brand-new transfer
this<00:01:51.280> because<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.759> fact<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:53.479> it's

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
this because of the fact that it's

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.609 
this because of the fact that it's
diesel<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.950> has<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.250> lower<00:01:56.000> RPM<00:01:56.509> rating<00:01:56.990> and

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
diesel it has a lower RPM rating and

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.230 
diesel it has a lower RPM rating and
we're<00:01:57.890> going<00:01:58.069> to<00:01:58.099> need<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.340> have<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.759> RPMs<00:01:59.179> a

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
we're going to need to have the RPMs a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.639 
we're going to need to have the RPMs a
little<00:01:59.450> higher<00:01:59.599> for<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.959> electric<00:02:00.349> motor<00:02:00.560> to

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
little higher for the electric motor to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.990 
little higher for the electric motor to
make<00:02:00.860> sure<00:02:01.039> that<00:02:01.220> we<00:02:01.310> don't<00:02:01.429> stall<00:02:01.849> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
make sure that we don't stall the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.660 
make sure that we don't stall the
electric<00:02:02.420> motor<00:02:02.709> the<00:02:03.709> dashboard<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.399> pretty

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
electric motor the dashboard is pretty

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.539 
electric motor the dashboard is pretty
ugly<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.920> don't<00:02:06.920> think<00:02:07.099> we're<00:02:07.220> going<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.399> end<00:02:07.520> up

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
ugly I don't think we're going to end up

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.059 
ugly I don't think we're going to end up
doing<00:02:07.880> much<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.329> the<00:02:08.450> dash<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:09.560> can<00:02:09.679> see<00:02:09.860> here

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
doing much to the dash you can see here

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.300 
doing much to the dash you can see here
there<00:02:10.190> wasn't<00:02:10.640> much<00:02:11.049> up<00:02:12.049> here<00:02:12.109> it<00:02:12.739> wasn't<00:02:13.010> even

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
there wasn't much up here it wasn't even

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.000 
there wasn't much up here it wasn't even
really<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> radio<00:02:14.120> or<00:02:14.390> anything<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.109> it<00:02:15.829> was

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
really a radio or anything so it was

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.640 
really a radio or anything so it was
pretty<00:02:17.079> pretty<00:02:18.079> boring<00:02:18.620> looking<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:21.470> might

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
pretty pretty boring looking so we might

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.069 
pretty pretty boring looking so we might
jazz<00:02:21.859> it<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.220> little<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.720> whole<00:02:23.810> lot

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
jazz it up a little but not a whole lot

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.949 
jazz it up a little but not a whole lot
