there's were more they were bigger basis
so<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.079> didn't<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.860> anything<00:01:41.070> too

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
so I didn't want to do anything too

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
so I didn't want to do anything too
crazy<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.540> wanted<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.020> something

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
crazy and I just wanted to do something

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
crazy and I just wanted to do something
a<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.409> smaller<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.210> Walmart<00:01:45.210> had<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
a little smaller and Walmart had the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.109 
a little smaller and Walmart had the
perfect<00:01:45.930> base<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
perfect base and this was it so this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.910 
perfect base and this was it so this
ended<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.479> being<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.530> three

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
ended up being like right around three

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.420 
ended up being like right around three
or<00:01:49.950> four<00:01:50.250> dollars<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.299> loved<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.530> say

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
or four dollars and I loved it so I say

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
or four dollars and I loved it so I say
check<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.210> local<00:01:54.270> Walmart<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.560> there's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
check your local Walmart because there's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
are a little cheaper than Michaels which

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
are a little cheaper than Michaels which
is<00:01:58.350> crazy<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.829> usually<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.490> use

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
is crazy because usually if you use

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
is crazy because usually if you use
coupons<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.329> Michael's<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:00.930> pretty

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
comparable but this was a thumbs up so

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.280 
comparable but this was a thumbs up so
