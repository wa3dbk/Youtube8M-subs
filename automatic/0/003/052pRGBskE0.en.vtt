 hello welcome girl do you want to make a 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.639
 makeup that suits the way 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.950
 your face your face is elongated fronts 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.230
 wide and long barrel are the arms 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.270
 that predominate in this type of load 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.100
 we must know them because they are those 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.410
 that we are going to have to disguise and 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.500
 soften when we have to make up 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.410
 the makeup for long face is based 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.720
 a use of two base shades one 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.700
 of the color of the skin and another darker 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 which will be applied to the forehead and 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.030
 chin 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.280
 apply a test for face this 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 moisturize the skin and help smooth the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.710
 since makeup lasts longer 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 applied all over the face avoiding the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 area of the eyes 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.900
 place the concealer where possible with 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.910
 brush under the eyes until the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.250
 lacrimal area and extending you a 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.470
 little upwards disguise the dark circles 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.290
 it will visually shorten to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.900
 long face 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.210
 with the help of a sponge or with 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 fingers applies the base that is the same 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.340
 skin color all over the face 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.050
 you can complete the base with a little 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.050
 volatile dust 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.329
 once applied concealer and base 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.820
 Apply to the base darker than the skin 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.759
 at the hairline and until the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.890
 center of the forehead blurring how well 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.909

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.909
 clearer base 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.830

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.160

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.160

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.410
 makeup to finish 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.290
 if you are going to make up eyes and cheeks do it 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.990
 always horizontally will help 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.660

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.760
