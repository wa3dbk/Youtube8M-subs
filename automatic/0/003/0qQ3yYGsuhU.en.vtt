00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.709
 half or expensive watson 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:22.920
 the staff then the jury will talk about the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:30.050
 Beige book that God worked out during the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 my choice is the red and white line 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 it was all down 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 this is the chile spent and anyway 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:57.930
 if the drop down left all the goal 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.980
 down but it was $ 8 bought because of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 the option even if it was a time already 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.869
 who did not like review is the last was 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.540
 of the host was already doing a thousand 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.680
 now the user is a size level of this 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 size and I double the time but here you are 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 had to make the semester final if it is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 for me at least we did not have 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 we're in the other car at the strike of the year 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 nec past have I have no 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:39.030
 and even then I was able to catch myself 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.360
 I read pretty good 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.090
 the synopsis of the book 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.770
 someone decided to cut grass exactly 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.530
 at the same moment that I'm going to win the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.910
 that then if you hear more than the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 light grass 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.030
 there was a very strange death of the anti 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.670
 aids death of a brother a very way 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.530
 mysterious did not even know how and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.550
 found that close to where he 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.120
 had died 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.179
 had huge footprints of a dog 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.330
 and with that of which it impacts of dog is 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.570
 came a very old legend 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.440
 which involved the family for many years 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.330
 ago many many years of the two 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.290
 people of this family had already died 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.290
 because of a huge black dog and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.110
 G8 had killed two members of the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.760
 family and everyone in that place had 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.330
 Finding that Senate held this and the key 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.000
 here is had been the baskervilles dog 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.769
 who had killed the site ign 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.590
 So to solve all this mystery 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.380
 they called in no less than 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.280
 sherlock holmes and his faithful squire 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.380
 doctor watson 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.420
 I liked the book and it does not have an end. 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.330
 about the surprising thought that he was going to 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.290
 have you at the end of the book is that the 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.030
 My god and he does not have it but he goes 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.100
 give us a clue little by little I thought 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.250
 could be someone else who is not cool 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.040
 on track but so is but it gives a 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.830
 explanation at the end joaquim gomes and 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.720
 So the guy to talk has to 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.810
 be very clever and 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.060
 will be like diesel oil is a very expensive 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.799
 Smart because what he said 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.100
 that explanation he gave at the end 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.209
 of the book he left no tip 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.560
 loose in history 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.530
 It took me a little while to get used to it 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:41.110
 with this narrative is difficult is the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:45.860
 July language 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.410
 language is much easier, I 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.120
 I did not know very well what they changed. 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.830
 of place 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.440
 if she does not know very well that you 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.659
 I thought they were inside the mansion 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.909
 and soon the inscriptions begin 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:04.760
 They have trees and the sky and then I invention 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.269
 also did not know they were there in 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.260
 white mansion while cars 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.629
 london also all this is but after me 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.199
 I got used to it and history was very cool. 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.519
 even I liked my book did not hide 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.229
 five stars 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.930
 I wish I had given four stars and 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.889
 half because I do not think it was the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.850
 my God 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.800
 there is a book but it is certainly not 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.080
 end it would not be but I think 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.380
 would be more practical than for four 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.940
 so escape by the sorry ones was not only 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.020
 That's right I had to talk about 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.690
 book is this book has several adaptations 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.289
 a lot loses and green makes you talk 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.100
 on 26 dates I have not seen any I know 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.990
 who now have until the series sherlock that 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.810
 has an episode that is based on that 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.760
 book is to convince this shock and only 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.190
 episode but it was at the end of the week 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.800
 Santa started in college then 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.880
 I just stopped at everything and I'm 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.639
 on vacation 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.599
 It's strange, I'm on holiday in October. 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.729
 in October and then have nothing more time and 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.949
 now I 'll see if I can like it more 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.580
 videos now more often in these 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.310
 next weeks on the channel and also now 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.910
 October I'm going to do at lowe's time 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.880
 in the channel I've already started more or less 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.770
 that I have any 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.770
 at night the bank did not aim to conquer 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.980
 big day of playing more with less and it's 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.940
 what I have to follow here has 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.900
 goiania go 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.950
 in Portuguese he is the cemetery book 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:51.050
 new game and then we'll start our 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.670
 Stop the event, make love now. 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.750
 I want to be clear the passenger John of 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.920
 clay 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:03.110
 so now I left I gave a fright 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.290
 So this is not a book of 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.630
 terror in the cl has to do with the heat 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.790
 and I'll see if I can get by the way 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.860
 I think I said he's fast and then 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.290
 soon after I 'm with you a book of 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.730
 terror only managed this until the pilot 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.200
 but I think so because every case of 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.410
 vacation program 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.240
 So how can I do it then? 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.910
 That's it. I think I managed to make a 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.530
 2011 faster this time was always 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.690
 taking a lot of time with clothes that 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.510
 obviously likes to do what 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.670
 simply the numbers appear on the 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.980
 my head and I can not help it then 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.770
 This is it, bye, next video
