00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.290
 Christmas depression I know that today is a 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.930
 day where everything is happy they open their 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.880
 gifts have reheated but there is a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.500
 much of the population that today what 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.290
 only we feel is depression 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.330
 postpartum and how we're going to feel 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.010
 I say one wakes up repentant crude 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.930
 embarrassed because I'm sure that 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.369
 last night although denied by many 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.400
 you ended up holding each other with your 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.220
 political cousins singing we wish you a 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.410
 merry christmas or something all 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.789
 volume also while you were crying there is no 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.680
 many people who believe that Christmas is 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.159
 very sad that they begin to say that already 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.170
 we are ranches things like poor fish 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:41.329
 just drink and drink in the river game 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.920
 sure that last night at some point in the 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.750
 drunkenness they told their whole family 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.579
 who wanted it or is it one you usually do 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.790
 things like and here and here I love you and you 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.200
 I want 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.890
 very well in the year to know if we do 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.420
 business grandpa help you 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.100
 sorry to those who are eating the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.320
 reheated but that's what happens in 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.460
 Christmas that's what many of us do and 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.710
 everyone says that life is a 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.720
 moment of love and happiness and peace who 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.830
 You can be happy when you do not bring a bar or 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.990
 in the portfolio 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.060
 I have a news that money I 'm not going to 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.850
 recover even if they make a sale with 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.560
 the gifts that gave him three last night 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 weights of aunt's scarf and twelve of 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.370
 chocolates are not going to make your life and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.440
 the truth is a sad moment sometimes 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.480
 it hits us because you can not help thinking 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.970
 in how many Christmases have you gone without 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.760
 boyfriend do not you try to comfort yourself thinking 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.790
 as good but the year with thirst I was 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.680
 with juan al is not to be imaginary 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.210
 I have a cousin who believe it or not 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.500
 at Christmas when people start to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.560
 phone your loved ones 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.510
 she invents calls and this year yesterday 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 I was taking talking and he wants you not 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.720
 I know she started as if happy Christmas 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.550
 my love if my love no not with who you are 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 talking because you do not answer me idiot and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.140
 this ended up super drunk throwing up 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.850
 I gave Grandpa two times really to me 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.250
 It makes it very sad to think, for example, 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.300
 poor turkeys who died this month the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.920
 destitute who were to be 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.140
 alone on Christmas Eve I get super 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.800
 sad and above all for the dignity that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.780
 I lost last night so if you think about it 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.760
 probably start liking them this 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.080
 time of year because many times it happens 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.240
 more often than we all have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.440
 sex so it was my part of 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.550
 contribution to make them very happy 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.550
 merry christmas
