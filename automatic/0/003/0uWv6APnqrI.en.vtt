00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.409

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.659
 keyboard was dell on my mouse pad 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.489

 This is a fucking joke, the guys have already taken it. 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.180

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.180
 for you, only you see the box 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:09.220
 This one here has five buttons. 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:11.829
 programmable for it weighs 7 feet 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.470

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.109
 two meters of very nice wire he comes 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 with synapse laser 2.0 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.200
 What else can I say about him each one? 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.879

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.790
 take out the box 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.700
 equipment in the region is very 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.470
 pretty lit mask is very cool 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.129
 to see a detail of the symbol of the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.129
 reservation 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:51.430
 ok the 12 x 3 buttons is not with that or 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.579

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:07.569
 It's digital, do not vote that way. 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.819
 so flame fred is 6,400 of ipi that has 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.629
 and has a 4g sensor a sensor 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.329
 infrared 4g expand in detail 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.039
 This is the reason to defend 2013 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.799
 The mouse is very cool, people. 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.330
 comfortable very good to play 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.400
 the federal dean is that he was 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.200
 considered to be one of the very bad 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.970
 best bad in the world and then released 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.300

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.230
 I found year I wanted nothing expensive at all. 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.690
 exaggerated so much that it does not have 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.430
 enough space to put you can 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.350
 see that he has several models of him here 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.530
