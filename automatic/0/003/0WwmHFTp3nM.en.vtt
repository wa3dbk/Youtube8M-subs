00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.150 
changing that so now that we have an
account<00:02:26.930> system<00:02:27.230> Nintendo<00:02:27.709> will<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.920> able<00:02:28.070> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
account system Nintendo will be able to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.650 
account system Nintendo will be able to
offer<00:02:28.280> more<00:02:28.490> flexible<00:02:28.970> price<00:02:29.240> points<00:02:29.600> to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
offer more flexible price points to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.820 
offer more flexible price points to
consumers<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> meet<00:02:30.350> certain<00:02:30.560> conditions

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
consumers to meet certain conditions

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.130 
consumers to meet certain conditions
like<00:02:31.490> for<00:02:31.730> example<00:02:31.820> being<00:02:32.390> able<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.780> buy<00:02:32.900> games

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
like for example being able to buy games

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.900 
like for example being able to buy games
at<00:02:33.320> a<00:02:33.350> cheaper<00:02:33.680> price<00:02:33.709> point<00:02:34.250> by<00:02:34.370> buying<00:02:34.610> more

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
at a cheaper price point by buying more

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.160 
at a cheaper price point by buying more
and<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.300> want<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.600> also<00:02:35.720> brought<00:02:35.990> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
and you want to also brought the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.570 
and you want to also brought the
condition<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.650> inviting<00:02:37.010> friends<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.370> play<00:02:37.490> a

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
condition of inviting friends to play a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.220 
condition of inviting friends to play a
particular<00:02:37.790> game<00:02:38.330> which<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.690> guess<00:02:38.900> invoke

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
particular game which I guess invoke

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.690 
particular game which I guess invoke
some<00:02:39.410> sort<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.709> group<00:02:39.890> discount<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
some sort of group discount so the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.040 
some sort of group discount so the
bottom<00:02:40.850> line<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.360> we<00:02:41.600> can<00:02:41.780> expect

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
bottom line is that we can expect

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.420 
bottom line is that we can expect
Nintendo<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.530> be<00:02:42.620> more<00:02:42.800> lenient<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
Nintendo to be more lenient with the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.830 
Nintendo to be more lenient with the
price<00:02:43.610> point<00:02:43.880> in<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> future<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:44.780> just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
price point in the future not just

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.390 
price point in the future not just
sticking<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> fifty<00:02:45.830> or<00:02:45.890> sixty<00:02:46.070> dollar

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
sticking to a fifty or sixty dollar

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.310 
sticking to a fifty or sixty dollar
price<00:02:46.640> point<00:02:46.940> no<00:02:47.060> matter<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.810> Nintendo

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
price point no matter what and Nintendo

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.360 
price point no matter what and Nintendo
also<00:02:48.500> talked<00:02:48.830> about<00:02:48.860> how<00:02:49.160> they're<00:02:49.280> gonna

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
also talked about how they're gonna

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.860 
also talked about how they're gonna
leverage<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.880> use<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.060> smartphones<00:02:50.510> they

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
leverage the use of smartphones they

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.330 
leverage the use of smartphones they
actually<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> small<00:02:51.709> select<00:02:52.040> team<00:02:52.220> of

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
actually have a small select team of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.830 
actually have a small select team of
developers<00:02:52.430> working<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.510> they<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
developers working on it so they want to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.150 
developers working on it so they want to
be<00:02:53.930> able<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.380> something<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:54.890> truly

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
be able to do something that is truly

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.979 
be able to do something that is truly
valuable<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.060> unique<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.420> Nintendo

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
valuable and that is unique to Nintendo

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.390 
valuable and that is unique to Nintendo
with<00:02:57.230> smartphones<00:02:57.830> it's<00:02:58.070> simply<00:02:58.340> just

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
with smartphones it's simply just

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.370 
with smartphones it's simply just
releasing<00:02:58.940> gains<00:02:59.120> all<00:02:59.330> these<00:02:59.480> devices<00:02:59.810> isn't

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
releasing gains all these devices isn't

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.900 
releasing gains all these devices isn't
what<00:03:00.470> they<00:03:00.590> want<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.310> Nintendo<00:03:01.700> is

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
what they want to do and Nintendo is

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.670 
what they want to do and Nintendo is
being<00:03:02.180> lenient<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.600> smartphones<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.470> wanna

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
being lenient with smartphones you wanna

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.199 
being lenient with smartphones you wanna
haven't<00:03:04.040> actually<00:03:04.160> given<00:03:04.519> any<00:03:04.670> restrictions

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
haven't actually given any restrictions

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.640 
haven't actually given any restrictions
to<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.570> development<00:03:06.049> team<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.380> it's<00:03:06.530> not

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
to the development team so it's not

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.050 
to the development team so it's not
really<00:03:06.709> not<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.160> possibility<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.820> they'll

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
really not the possibility that they'll

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.820 
really not the possibility that they'll
make<00:03:08.209> games<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.019> Nintendo<00:03:09.410> does<00:03:09.590> make<00:03:09.799> a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
make games but if Nintendo does make a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.380 
make games but if Nintendo does make a
game<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.430> will<00:03:10.489> probably<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:10.940> be<00:03:11.000> some<00:03:11.239> sort

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
game it will probably just be some sort

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.120 
game it will probably just be some sort
of<00:03:11.510> mini<00:03:11.720> game<00:03:11.959> or<00:03:12.170> maybe<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.440> companion<00:03:12.980> app

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
of mini game or maybe a companion app

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.830 
of mini game or maybe a companion app
that<00:03:13.280> works<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.700> conjunction<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.360> game<00:03:14.660> on

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
that works in conjunction with a game on

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.690 
that works in conjunction with a game on
the<00:03:14.870> three<00:03:15.080> days<00:03:15.200> over<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:16.130> won't<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.580> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
the three days over you it won't be the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
finally is that one of the bigger pieces

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.100 
finally is that one of the bigger pieces
the<00:03:19.940> news<00:03:20.120> during<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.510> meeting<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:20.959> that

they're gonna be building a new branch
for<00:03:23.810> themselves<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.530> Nintendo<00:03:24.920> wants<00:03:25.130> be<00:03:25.220> able

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400
