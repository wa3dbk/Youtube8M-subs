with a motor and it's way cooler and

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.529 
with a motor and it's way cooler and
better<00:00:45.199> than<00:00:45.469> a<00:00:45.559> Segway<00:00:45.949> well<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.269> first

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.690 
which you can get this inside of the
package<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.440> write<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.619> off<00:01:45.950> roads<00:01:46.340> or

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
package so you can write it off roads or

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.749 
package so you can write it off roads or
in<00:01:46.759> roads<00:01:47.509> I<00:01:47.869> mean<00:01:48.350> like<00:01:48.530> that's<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.189> solar

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
in roads I mean like that's what solar

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.210 
in roads I mean like that's what solar
will<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.210> not<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:50.930> heavy<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.710> only<00:01:51.920> weights

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
will is not that heavy it only weights

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.810 
will is not that heavy it only weights
11<00:01:52.700> kilograms<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:54.380> is<00:01:54.590> delighted<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.670> be

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
11 kilograms and it is delighted to be

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.810 
11 kilograms and it is delighted to be
the<00:01:56.090> most<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.840> packets<00:01:57.350> motor<00:01:57.950> vehicle<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:58.670> the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
the most of packets motor vehicle in the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.539 
the most of packets motor vehicle in the
world<00:01:59.110> so<00:02:00.110> when<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.860> compare<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.369> a

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
world so when you compare it to a

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.020 
world so when you compare it to a
motorcycle<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.960> car<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.190> light<00:02:04.549> if<00:02:04.909> you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030

bruised<00:02:16.250> my<00:02:16.280> hand<00:02:16.670> pretty<00:02:16.910> badly<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.480> there's

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
bruised my hand pretty badly and there's

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.540 
bruised my hand pretty badly and there's

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
actually a picture on Twitter so if you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.540 
actually a picture on Twitter so if you
wants<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.850> see<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.300> perform<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.470> Twitter<00:02:21.769> but

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
wants to see it perform a on Twitter but

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.940 
wants to see it perform a on Twitter but
anyways<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.810> device<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.560> made<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.860> be

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
anyways this device is made to be

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.250 
anyways this device is made to be
durable<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.640> will<00:02:25.940> mechanism<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.019> quite

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
durable so will mechanism is quite

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.309 
durable so will mechanism is quite
simple<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.950> uses<00:02:28.760> electric<00:02:29.510> engine<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
simple it uses electric engine the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.259 
simple it uses electric engine the
battery<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.340> charger<00:02:31.370> stabilized

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
battery and the charger stabilized

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.680 
battery and the charger stabilized
system<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.890> lean<00:02:34.069> forward<00:02:34.310> or<00:02:35.060> backward

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
system so you lean forward or backward

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.110 
system so you lean forward or backward
and<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.799> way<00:02:36.980> you've<00:02:37.519> used<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
and that's the way you've used the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.479 
and that's the way you've used the
device<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.200> may<00:02:39.350> ask<00:02:39.530> what's<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> feeling

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
device you may ask what's the feeling

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.030 
device you may ask what's the feeling
when<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.760> write<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.150> device<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:42.530> actually

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
when you write this device it's actually

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.819 
when you write this device it's actually
when<00:02:44.030> you're<00:02:44.180> skiing<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.709> you're

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
when you're skiing and when you're

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.100 
when you're skiing and when you're
hovering<00:02:46.250> at<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.489> same<00:02:46.700> time<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.480> it's<00:02:47.660> like

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
hovering at the same time so it's like

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.170 
hovering at the same time so it's like
trying<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.739> ride<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.010> bicycle<00:02:49.310> for<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.970> first

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
trying to ride a bicycle for the first

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.390 
trying to ride a bicycle for the first
time

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
time

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.449 
time
the<00:02:52.000> cost<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.860> device<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.159> extremely

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
the cost of this device is extremely

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.440 
the cost of this device is extremely
pricey<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:55.900> compared<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:57.610> Segway<00:02:58.090> or

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
pricey but compared to the Segway or

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.890 
pricey but compared to the Segway or
motorcycle<00:02:59.349> it's<00:02:59.650> not<00:03:00.640> surprising<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.750> it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
motorcycle it's not surprising so it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.820 
motorcycle it's not surprising so it
runs<00:03:02.140> about<00:03:02.560> 500<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.930> 1500<00:03:04.930> euros<00:03:05.319> so

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
runs about 500 to 1500 euros so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.020 
runs about 500 to 1500 euros so
approximately<00:03:06.690> $750<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:08.069> $2,000<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.579> compared

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
approximately $750 to $2,000 so compared

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.789 
approximately $750 to $2,000 so compared
to<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.269> models<00:03:10.629> there<00:03:11.140> are<00:03:11.170> different<00:03:11.650> models
