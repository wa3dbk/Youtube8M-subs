beat
right<00:04:08.490> now<00:04:08.640> we're<00:04:08.760> dividing<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.210> beam<00:04:09.390> into

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
right now we're dividing that beam into

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.690 
right now we're dividing that beam into
two<00:04:09.750> parts<00:04:10.350> with<00:04:10.500> our<00:04:10.620> down<00:04:10.860> down

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.100 

that's<00:04:14.700> gonna<00:04:14.880> be<00:04:14.970> eight<00:04:15.150> know<00:04:15.360> what<00:04:16.080> a

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
that's gonna be eight know what a

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.930 
that's gonna be eight know what a
sixteenth<00:04:16.680> note<00:04:16.830> it<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.430> where<00:04:17.610> you<00:04:17.700> divide

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
sixteenth note it is is where you divide

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.979 
sixteenth note it is is where you divide
that<00:04:17.970> into<00:04:18.300> four<00:04:18.570> parts

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
that into four parts

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.319 
that into four parts
one<00:04:19.230> two

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
one two

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.330
