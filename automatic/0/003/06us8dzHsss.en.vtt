00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Moscow Falconers we return to the air 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 this is the grand final of the starseriya we are visiting 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.099
 expert in disputes with no dari man 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.110
 which did not give knocked out with 2 finals 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.960
 Season Alexey and you not to be sick and me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.439
 not to be ill what is not to be ill 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.619
 flew you keep my joke in what 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.580
 there was a problem in the first two games so 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.470
 this we keep joking give something 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.570
 what else besides have we not given as a type 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.160
 Fleece cheeks it well I do not know in my opinion he is 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.579
 like this i have not found copies which is not 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 hit so well overall it was 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.860
 hurt okay the first two games we did 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
 forecast everything was done on forecasts for 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.170
 dragons especially today before 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.660
 they revol about carps just carried 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 now after these two games easy 30 or 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 dragons guess banned did not give all 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.149
 will go differently well i mean they are you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 accurately guess that is just the morality 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.020
 this is what you think mother is a draw to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 because there is no return in general, of course 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 problems are not only not given and this is me 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 I think one of the thoughts that visited from 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.510
 the first game but in the second game their 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 visited the idea that more problems 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 all the same in weeks but in general I think 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.970
 onyx morals dream and on very high 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.390
 level 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.400
 but I don’t know how they are not very clear 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.560
 the peaks for the second game apparently they have something 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.960
 went wrong after the first and after that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 they are so little master of real yes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.829
 as there any master and from realia in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 In general, renekton twice even to study what 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.939
 power house constantly plays it its type 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 and how is the crown hero 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 Well I do not know flash teleport 3 no I do not 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 like of course it’s cool something 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.790
 there were courses but it’s so much 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.460
 Damage that is, but still not 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.759
 it turns out with the release of the same 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.619
 one beat whole how is it there in the theater 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.720
 no one on i believe but on the other hand it 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.090
 again tiamat renekton and if some 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.189
 problems become too useless 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 I think it's better to pick something up 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.579
 is more light on top especially 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 if there are two lines 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.149
 almost always with teleport you can 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.060
 go to leith by splitting the gun and 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.140
 all sorts of jaxx rails and times will be where 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.200
 more useful to me 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.520
 now looking at the first two games looking at something 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.030
 so we suppose we see not given in 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.950
 bathhouse 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.510
 something opens for example then noise organs 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.150
 on one of the games there or maybe zyx 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 the whole game will open 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.190
 see peter poker she's a legato 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.110
 naori from how energy sharif first game 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
 was good enough to leave 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.819
 its on and get setpoint Alec warrior 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.069
 such that is to the most crucial games or 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.650
 worth on safe options type ariadne 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.780
 stop and men do not know at all 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 while I was most impressed by 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.129
 de here it is very strange that she does not 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.370
 tried to take in the second game decided 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.599
 take some kind of rianna well i'm not a whole 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 I know what he has 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.640
 Well, there was a problem in the first game that he 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.290
 tried to zadenayit not given because of this he 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.410
 asked for creeps because while he was 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.360
 not given no share creeps otkhile hair 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.989
 in the second game, again, it's like we dawn 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.790
 and de nile 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.080
 but also from this call out fishing booth 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.450
 killed and then again everything is bad 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.730
 It became and how to rub so far, just 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.680
 Kira feels the situation is better and legat 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.450
 I do not quite understand or do not receive 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.930
 help django strung I don't know 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.519
 Said that while and Kira plays on not gave 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.760
 Peter's credits is another such option and as with 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.470
 fight it and not succeed in it 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.390
 okay well that means you need to change 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.430
 it is not necessary to ban now 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.220
 the dragon is here to further everything 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.930
 Well they did not give a ban only I think 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.400
 there is no point in touching bans at all 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.980
 because semi champions he we 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.019
 saw some on the whole than anything the whole, I 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.120
 I think there is no sense in taking it away from her 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.069
 and how to be honest I don’t 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 saw a particular problem it seems to me he 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.909
 created more problems for his 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.700
 team for not given which it poured 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.680
 extra load pulled at all what 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.959
 better dzhangir example did not give a shit yes 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.610
 under the same kind of some of their leaders Rachel 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.650
 who are just and from behind you like a man 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.959
 who perfectly understand that is what 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.730
 he must do protect it you or 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.530
 on the contrary more to deal with them 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.750
 assurances that you do not reach out as 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.299
 as mider throwing from the shelf to the team 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.709
 just but generally I don’t always know 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.730
 did blue like because he could 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.709
 perform both roles 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.799
 i'm not very sure about this patch about 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.920
 him attacks but overall i really like 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.880
 cassin don't know this guy very much 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.650
 dangerous i think he's in this game very 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.720
 forced many problems 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.040
 and much more than a master and past 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.470
 master and from the world 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.720
 Well, in general, very strange that 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.360
 our past sin zakazik seven well so 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.370
 as it went to some kind of split push collected 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.440
 such the sun fire and generally rather than 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.490
 to try to denat master somehow 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 there to look for him in the forest 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.450
 either try gang it played too 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.690
 farm and even sort of surpassed there 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.940
 was catching up but the whole of it was in my 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.040
 not so much sense while carps 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.930
 all the time they get behind the doctor shadow 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.180
 each dragon in both games that is 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.600
 they feel it better or something they 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.220
 just see this game in it was 5 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.830
 or see the game better than their opponents 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.450
 or mirror is a mistake I think mirror 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.310
 not quite sure of myself this was 5 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.440
 generally felt than well yes I can not 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.480
 understand how to learn as a whole the error in the 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.280
 dragons somehow play but don't know 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.470
 let's build in order not yet played before 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.720
 some kind of weak incomprehensible game 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.760
 there are usually dragons themselves yes they take 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.280
 that there forsat forsen then go on 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.669
 dragon and here they stand and wait and just 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.830
 enemies go there in almost every game you can 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.870
 see how Sasha at a certain moment 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.760
 comes set pspo standing there in the bush 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.800
 or here it came out to the gang either 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.200
 pushed and bohan rushed at the dragon a 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.600
 mirror here moment farms and 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.910
 well well it's not you don't come on 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.169
 counter gank and on like on the other hand then 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.910
 there is generally a whole from the first game of the muse 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.160
 kaziksa at least did something there on the top 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.690
 came out broke the tower there well that is more 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.370
 less for the dragon they had was at least 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.560
 some kind of compensation though 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.320
 A score of 5 2 there was a backlog in 2000 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.840
 Golda is due to the fact that the Sasha again 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.640
 came on their battle on from the world 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.590
 worked did not get any help 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.210
 and there was jenks which bezus clips 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.400
 and that was very unpleasant to stand somewhere 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.310
 in the second game for the master is not at all 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.220
 came out of the woods and I think that this is well 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.530
 it delivers enough problem and in 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.229
 Overall, well, sort of like master whale leith game 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.120
 juggler but there it was clear that the enemies 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.860
 so much control there lula which 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.140
 his almost completely cantrell is 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.300
 and relay and in general I think he needs 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.430
 somehow activated and more active 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.110
 behave because for now it seems to me 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.510
 Sasha is very much replaying the result we 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.850
 waited that we have carps yes there hi-pts 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.500
 hobbs hobbs finals blown away well 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.750
 the dragon is the same dragons 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.970
 as a result, we see dragons that seem to be in 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.340
 as a result, those who understand the whole of hell 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.009
 they say the fight and the shops of the days they should they 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.889
 blow off the carp and eventually they blow off 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:43.249
 final hpc h300 but see yes that is how 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.680
 we are like you discussed legat yesterday with 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:47.569
 world against the Soviet Union erases well, and while 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.550
 it is clear that now Kira replay them and 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.099
 Overall, I think this is a big part of the game. 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.149
 decides because he heard 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.129
 wins 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:57.379
 sideline and akira wins 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.749
 medline and forecasts for the rest 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:03.199
 matches that we will have hour 21 already in 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:04.279
 carpe diem 3122 favor at least 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.469
 come on next cool 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:10.099
 the dragons will be back now to draw conclusions 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:13.490
 or they are already broken well overall i think 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.300
 Now they somehow cheer up and show 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.149
 something other 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.069
 of course you do not want to predict 31 and in 

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.879
 On the whole, I want to see how complete 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.129
 best of 5 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:26.300
 sorry not something no this is a plan of peaks and so 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:27.430
 further, and then there is care as us that chance but in
