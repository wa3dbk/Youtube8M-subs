00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
there's no expiration look on this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.250 
there's no expiration look on this
little<00:03:06.690> too<00:03:06.959> oh<00:03:07.730> well<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.819> says<00:03:08.970> august<00:03:09.420> 2013

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
little too oh well it says august 2013

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.149 
little too oh well it says august 2013
but<00:03:11.220> i<00:03:11.580> don't<00:03:12.000> think<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.569> i<00:03:13.110> think<00:03:13.650> that's

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
but i don't think that i think that's

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.800 
but i don't think that i think that's
for<00:03:14.550> when<00:03:14.640> they're<00:03:14.819> sealed<00:03:15.180> i<00:03:15.450> don't<00:03:15.599> think

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
for when they're sealed i don't think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.229 
for when they're sealed i don't think
once<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.110> open<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.680> they<00:03:17.370> last<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.909> long

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
once you open them they last that long

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.720 
once you open them they last that long
so<00:03:18.659> i<00:03:18.989> probably<00:03:19.800> say<00:03:20.159> for<00:03:20.370> something<00:03:20.640> like

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
so i probably say for something like

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.479 
so i probably say for something like
this<00:03:20.790> maybe<00:03:21.239> 30<00:03:21.599> days<00:03:22.040> i'm<00:03:23.040> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> toss

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
this maybe 30 days i'm going to toss

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.699 
this maybe 30 days i'm going to toss
them<00:03:23.760> after<00:03:24.269> halloween<00:03:24.659> anyway<00:03:25.019> because<00:03:25.260> i

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
them after halloween anyway because i

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.890

won't<00:03:25.980> have<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.640> need<00:03:27.000> for<00:03:27.030> them<00:03:27.390> after<00:03:27.599> that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
