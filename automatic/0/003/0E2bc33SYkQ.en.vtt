00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
mean it you even if you're making a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.030 
mean it you even if you're making a
Hollywood<00:00:34.050> sequel<00:00:34.380> you're<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.739> sure<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:34.950> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
Hollywood sequel you're not sure if it's

gonna<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> flop<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.790> i<00:00:35.820> well<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
gonna be a flop or not i well that's it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450 
gonna be a flop or not i well that's it
I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.590> important<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.280> support

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
I think it's really important to support

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
I think it's really important to support
the<00:00:38.790> culture<00:00:39.450> film<00:00:39.809> both<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.200> production<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the culture film both in production and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.440 
the culture film both in production and
distribution<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.329> it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
distribution and I think that it's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
distribution and I think that it's
really<00:00:42.660> important<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.890> project<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.430> run

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
really important the project that we run

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
really important the project that we run
secret<00:00:44.969> cinema<00:00:45.149> 18,000<00:00:46.020> people<00:00:46.289> bought<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
secret cinema 18,000 people bought a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.410 
secret cinema 18,000 people bought a

going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.829> kind

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
going to see so I think that that kind

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.080 
going to see so I think that that kind
of<00:00:50.100> tells<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.550> actually<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.969> more

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
of tells you that actually it's more

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
of tells you that actually it's more
about<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> culture<00:00:51.930> cinema<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
about the culture cinema and the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500 
about the culture cinema and the
experience<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> cinema<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
experience of going to the cinema but

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
experience of going to the cinema but
but<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> accept<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> past<00:00:55.980> perhaps

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
but you accept that in the past perhaps

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
but you accept that in the past perhaps
films<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> been<00:00:57.360> made<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:58.050> there's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
films have been made because there's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
films have been made because there's
been<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:58.530> other<00:00:58.829> funding<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> there's<00:01:00.030> been<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
been no other funding and there's been a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.549 
been no other funding and there's been a
very<00:01:00.359> good<00:01:00.480> reason<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> there's<00:01:01.320> been<00:01:01.440> no

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
very good reason that there's been no

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.020 
very good reason that there's been no
other<00:01:01.649> funding<00:01:02.070> forthcoming<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
other funding forthcoming because it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.979 
other funding forthcoming because it
just<00:01:03.149> wasn't<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> particularly<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.960> idea

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
just wasn't a particularly good idea

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
just wasn't a particularly good idea
well<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.280> yeah<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.270> that's

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
well I think yeah I think that's that's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
well I think yeah I think that's that's
very<00:01:06.869> valid<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.340> what

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
very valid I think that but I think what

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310 
very valid I think that but I think what
what<00:01:08.939> David<00:01:09.210> Cameron<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.780> saying<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
what David Cameron was really saying is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
what David Cameron was really saying is
that<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:11.070> support<00:01:11.250> commercial<00:01:12.000> films<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that to support commercial films but you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
that to support commercial films but you
don't<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.439> whether<00:01:13.710> films<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.280> be

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
don't really know whether films gonna be

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.370 
don't really know whether films gonna be
a<00:01:14.400> commercial<00:01:14.729> already<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> do

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a commercial already and I think you do

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
a commercial already and I think you do
need<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> support<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.130> types<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.580> filmmakers

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
some funding backers and said I want to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.060 
some funding backers and said I want to
make<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> black-and-white<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.649> mean<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.009> many

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
make a black-and-white I mean how many

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
make a black-and-white I mean how many
people<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.640> paper<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:51.119> stump<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.810> millions

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
people on paper would stump up millions

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600 
people on paper would stump up millions
for<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.409> yeah<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.340> that's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
for that yeah I think I think that's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.010 
for that yeah I think I think that's
very<00:01:53.670> true<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.210> think<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
very true and I think that the the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.050 
very true and I think that the the
artist<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> great<00:01:55.710> example<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.850> an

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
artist is a great example of just an

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.520 
artist is a great example of just an
incredible<00:01:57.810> film<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.259> could<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.500> easily

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
incredible film that could have easily

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.200 
incredible film that could have easily
become<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> very<00:01:59.430> small<00:01:59.700> film<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.090> it's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
become a very small film but it's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
become a very small film but it's
captured<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> imagination<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.710> been

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
captured the imagination and it's been

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
captured the imagination and it's been
distributed<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
distributed in the right way and it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
distributed in the right way and it's
now<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> hugely<00:02:05.399> successful<00:02:05.579> film

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
now you know a hugely successful film

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490 
now you know a hugely successful film
and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.750> we've<00:02:06.899> noticed<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.380> our

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and I think what we've noticed with our

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
and I think what we've noticed with our
audience<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.369> people<00:02:08.700> find<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:08.970> quite

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
audience is that people find it quite

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
audience is that people find it quite
hard<00:02:09.330> sometimes<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.319> artist<00:02:10.679> because

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
hard sometimes to see the artist because

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.809 
hard sometimes to see the artist because
sometimes<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> multiplex<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.239> you've<00:02:12.420> got

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
sometimes in the multiplex is you've got

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.149 
sometimes in the multiplex is you've got
films<00:02:13.299> playing<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.719> three<00:02:13.989> screens<00:02:14.799> out<00:02:15.010> of

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
films playing in three screens out of

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.209 
films playing in three screens out of
eight<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.819> think<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.359> really<00:02:16.749> really

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
eight and I think that's really really

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.589 
eight and I think that's really really
important<00:02:18.219> to<00:02:18.370> invest<00:02:18.969> in<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
important to invest in the in the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.910 
important to invest in the in the
development<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.139> audience<00:02:20.499> and<00:02:20.799> their

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
development of the audience and their

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.129 
development of the audience and their
experience<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.999> there<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> risk<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:22.870> now

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:23.139 
experience it is there a risk then now

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.629 
experience it is there a risk then now
do<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.499> think<00:02:23.739> if<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:23.980> goes<00:02:24.159> ahead<00:02:24.340> this

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:24.639 
do you think if this goes ahead this

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.729 
do you think if this goes ahead this
report<00:02:24.969> comes<00:02:25.150> out<00:02:25.269> next<00:02:25.540> week<00:02:25.689> that<00:02:26.349> perhaps

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
report comes out next week that perhaps

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.009 
report comes out next week that perhaps
the<00:02:27.400> whole<00:02:27.609> of<00:02:27.849> British<00:02:28.120> cinema<00:02:28.510> could<00:02:28.810> be

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
the whole of British cinema could be

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.440 
the whole of British cinema could be
dulled<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.010> sorted<00:02:30.579> in<00:02:30.700> some<00:02:30.939> sort<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.239> way

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
dulled and sorted in some sort of way

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.959 
dulled and sorted in some sort of way
and<00:02:31.689> all<00:02:32.109> those<00:02:32.319> imaginative<00:02:33.129> quirky

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
and all those imaginative quirky

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.309 
and all those imaginative quirky
interested<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.540> things<00:02:34.719> like<00:02:34.780> Wallace<00:02:35.079> &amp;

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
interested in things like Wallace &amp;

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.869 
interested in things like Wallace &amp;
Gromit<00:02:35.349> for<00:02:35.769> example<00:02:36.159> which<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.670> caught

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
Gromit for example which really caught

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.849 
Gromit for example which really caught
people's<00:02:36.909> imagination<00:02:37.870> might<00:02:38.590> not

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
people's imagination might not

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.589 
people's imagination might not
materialize<00:02:39.400> might<00:02:39.609> never<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.969> made<00:02:40.120> well<00:02:40.569> I

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
materialize might never be made well I

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.929 
materialize might never be made well I
think<00:02:40.719> I'm<00:02:40.900> looking<00:02:41.349> forward<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.849> hearing<00:02:42.849> the

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
think I'm looking forward to hearing the

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.330 
think I'm looking forward to hearing the
whole<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.540> guess<00:02:43.659> when<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.620> policy<00:02:44.859> does<00:02:45.069> come

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
whole I guess when the policy does come

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.610 
whole I guess when the policy does come
out<00:02:45.519> but<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:45.939> I<00:02:46.359> think<00:02:46.750> there<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.049> risk<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.560> I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
out but I I think there is a risk and I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.789 
out but I I think there is a risk and I
do

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
do

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.649 
do
I<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.069> hope<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.430> they'll<00:02:49.209> support

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
I do hope that they'll support

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.300 
I do hope that they'll support
everything<00:02:50.230> from<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.739> development<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
everything from the development of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.360 
everything from the development of
talent<00:02:51.489> all<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.359> way<00:02:52.480> through<00:02:52.870> I'm<00:02:53.680> hoping

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
talent all the way through I'm hoping

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.530 
talent all the way through I'm hoping
that<00:02:54.549> they'll<00:02:54.699> understand<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.329> King's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
that they'll understand that the King's

that they'll understand that the King's
Speech<00:02:55.659> is<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.079> film<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.439> was<00:02:56.699> rejected<00:02:57.699> by

Speech is a film that was rejected by
