start<00:02:46.740> with<00:02:46.890> our<00:02:47.120> security<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.900> means<00:02:49.140> we

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
start with our security that means we

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.320 
start with our security that means we
have<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> 50<00:02:50.220> meter<00:02:50.400> cable<00:02:50.700> drum<00:02:53.180> with<00:02:54.180> this

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
have a 50 meter cable drum with this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.560 
have a 50 meter cable drum with this
kind<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.660> cable<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.730> our<00:02:56.730> protection

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
kind of cable this is our protection

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.920 
kind of cable this is our protection
count<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.560> connect<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.040> at

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
count we have to connect it at

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.520 
count we have to connect it at
protection<00:03:00.930> ground<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.740> our<00:03:01.920> substation<00:03:03.530> this

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
protection ground in our substation this

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.890 
protection ground in our substation this
is<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.770> first<00:03:05.040> step<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.750> next

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
is the first step we have to do the next

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.310 
is the first step we have to do the next
step<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.380> we<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.890> red<00:03:08.580> cable<00:03:09.030> drum<00:03:09.320> inside

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
step is we have red cable drum inside

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.420 
step is we have red cable drum inside
here<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> few<00:03:12.210> spike<00:03:12.770> see<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.800> few<00:03:14.010> spike

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
here this is a few spike see a few spike

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.710 
here this is a few spike see a few spike
is<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:16.680> spike<00:03:17.220> we<00:03:17.460> have<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.760> put<00:03:17.940> around<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.450> car

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
is a spike we have to put around the car

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.890 
is a spike we have to put around the car
into<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.620> soil<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.820> check<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.450> resistance

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
into the soil to check the resistance

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
into the soil to check the resistance
between<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.160> spike<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.750> chassis<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.770> we

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
between the spike and the chassis so we

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.660 
between the spike and the chassis so we
can<00:03:26.100> check<00:03:26.340> with<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.970> resistance<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.680> ask

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
can check with this resistance the ask

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.860 
can check with this resistance the ask
earthing<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.690> system

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
earthing of the system

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.860 
earthing of the system
and<00:03:32.140> also<00:03:33.129> the<00:03:33.489> spike<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.940> important<00:03:34.510> if<00:03:34.720> a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
and also the spike is important if a

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.720 
and also the spike is important if a
wave<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.260> coming<00:03:35.440> back<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.950> our<00:03:36.010> van

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
wave is coming back to our van

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.030 
wave is coming back to our van
he<00:03:37.180> will<00:03:37.420> switch<00:03:37.870> off<00:03:40.050> if<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.290> increase<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.920> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
he will switch off if it increase of a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.160 
he will switch off if it increase of a
higher<00:03:42.280> voltage<00:03:42.760> than<00:03:42.790> 40<00:03:43.360> volts<00:03:43.750> on<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
higher voltage than 40 volts on the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.809 
higher voltage than 40 volts on the
philosophy<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.160> Testament

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
philosophy of the Testament

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.309 
philosophy of the Testament
this<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.300> a<00:03:46.330> very<00:03:46.629> important<00:03:47.110> thing<00:03:47.260> for

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
this is a very important thing for

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.949 
this is a very important thing for
safety<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.620> next<00:03:50.860> step<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.540> after<00:03:52.540> that

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
safety and the next step is after that

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.010 
safety and the next step is after that
we<00:03:53.170> have<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.470> take<00:03:53.709> out<00:03:53.980> our<00:03:54.720> emergency<00:03:55.720> off
