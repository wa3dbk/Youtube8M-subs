00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi everyone i'm sick and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 yes it happens but it will change that I 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.649
 I'll do the reviews so here's this 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 week to chapter so of bleach which 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.320
 fate and who hey you know you know in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.420
 general when I start a video with 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 these words is that in general the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.800
 chapter is not so great as that in all 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.330
 case if you see no smile already 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.670
 damn what no seriously it's fast 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 if in fact I have not it is not really 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.880
 what fascinates is what happens 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.439
 Muslims actually we have a little point a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 small stand by at the level of cassava rice 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.870
 so hitsugaya where this one heating etc 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 you are a product cjce inject a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 product and we discover that visibly 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 the other captains defeated it's up to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 to say to and Ken is so with 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.010
 matsumoto besides that are also 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 become zombies but are quickly manage 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 so by the other guys that's pretty 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 weird as technically these spaces 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.280
 the old prices varenne espada more 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 the other tranny who finally split 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.370
 in short who have levels of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.890
 vice-captain and still the prices in 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 spain for me and have levels 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 still a bit below prices 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.500
 variant spada by don davies sensor is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.299
 for me technically it should bah 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.590
 have no trouble finally cables 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 captains and zombies proud to see 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.540
 no difficulty exploding so this is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.970
 a trano guy or an italian and alien 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 ok but that's not what interests me 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.880
 plus what interests me most is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.409
 certainly what is happening at the level 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 on the other side ie 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.430
 now we have that there is so who 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
 advise back with others and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.890
 who had his little comeback there with 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.259
 his sentence 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.430
 wilf be careful my white blouse then 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.350
 that the guy blew himself up just 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 before by not not but hey all the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.180
 world forgot quickly there is key there 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.009
 there are only men that young people 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 ritter who remembers ounces at 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.250
 three of them were exploded 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.020
 so I do not know I think sorry to the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.659
 middle there was the stake that had 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.619
 exploded the eye at turin shot I know more 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.810
 if I do not know if it's him it's 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.829
 maybe the righteous but in all 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.600
 the cases me I think that from this point of 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.399
 view so much that there is a little in the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.689
 shit he technically fights three 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.159
 territories plus a fourth which 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.049
 control wanted to create a new game 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.810
 servant the l6 me wrong not that's the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.509
 ld i imagine celel for the offer 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.190
 so that's saying that start but 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.300
 inzaghi and control and so by that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.430
 new path throw an actor who has 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.050
 a low enough appearance there a little 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.640
 boat with wings finally his rival 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.440
 on a trick but it makes me think of a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.520
 kind of little angel I re div a like his 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.200
 end I do not know if you see what I 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.239
 I have an image in my head 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 that makes me think of myself not baby doc 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.810
 is there power of a thing obviously that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.550
 quote touch someone the guy is 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.680
 completely mad of him jeans in love 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.180
 limit love to the point of duty that can 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.860
 serve it so I do not know if it's okay 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.370
 how far is it really love 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.080
 love 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 in any case those who are affected and 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.040
 tokens and would have understood are controlled 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.540
 by that thing the proof for example the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.349
 only other throw a forgotten display under 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.569
 her initials I imagine that these 2 thong 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.709
 power I forget this power that were 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.290
 not hit that thing so is hit 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.599
 the other is an actor I believe I 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 it's eagle or tons between like that a 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.980
 in any case we have the fight that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.230
 so looming khouya against this 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.849
 new natural potting game 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.680
 so now I hold a game facing 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.030
 what is going to have I do not know of the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.319
 all I do not know where we go with that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.640
 because although it is up yaokÃ© 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.659
 fight this expose me parasols have 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.550
 maybe it's his fight of 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.310
 redemption his fight a come back 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.720
 I want to say what we all love 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.519
 ja although he was well-trained early 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 he was always stylus and his banker 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.909
 is still one of those rare banks to 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.349
 equivocal she 's just as dangerous to 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.790
 every time we see but because 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.950
 I have a lot of banquet convoy convoy 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.750
 convoy and in the end we forget this little 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.900
 dangerous side he had been managing by 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.060
 bankai example of kaya frankly 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.200
 limit we take even more the difference 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.680
 with really chic as it is 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.819
 said the banca and 2.2 and that is worth 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.930
 now it's the same thing when 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.599
 frankly we're just waiting for his 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.920
 falls in braille which we did not know 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.030
 much to say on this chapter to 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.030
 his as you see there is no 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.379
 really progressing a progression 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.209
 of the entire stand by on pass on 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.890
 our battlefield are always 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.420
 no news from division 1 0 that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.650
 makes a mess of time that we expect from 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.790
 see what's going on there fucking this 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.210
 that 100 days he died ben laden 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.980
 geronimo do not know 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.540
 and playing bach with our human beings 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.920
 in sections 0 angry I do not know 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.970
 I would like some answers because 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.760
 it looks much more interesting than 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.370
 see well kouyias leave or two I 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.100
 invite you to May so that the war that is 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 continues and who suffer little moment 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.850
 flat unfortunately since fighting 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.710
 since the fight between quickly make angie 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.760
 diakhou is a control and ce2 trust 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.460
 emitters star machin and remy damage 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.840
 frankly it's a shame I miss it 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.950
 just that that was the point 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.450
 strong of war for now and there 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.370
 we fall back into a small side dishes good 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.090
 there is even youri nice but laurent 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.440
 Gbagbo 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.250
 briefly start people will vote the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.350
 next week when you see them 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.920
 bleach chapters are we rugbymen 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.210
 too short I want to say it's 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.950
 pity the author should pull himself together 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.750
 because I doubt that this is what will 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.040
 boost bleach sales especially that 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.150
 this guy who had seen him do an article 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.260
 who are going to go so have sand when 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.710
 even he wants to make an art that are 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.360
 correct 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.540
 final mark must always be great 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.580
 correct and still like that 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.450
 imagine a bow 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.860
 here is the artt finale shit on 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.210
 wait, we did not follow the same example 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.270
 that the road to the conveyors by the 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.270
 short videos about his legion holds better
