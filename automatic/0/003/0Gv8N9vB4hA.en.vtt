00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.689
 Balance is flowing through charged so that she had told him before that 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.430
 these water molecules 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.870
 Percent are not pressed together but 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.029
 because she is slow 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.059
 only flow under heavy force 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.929
 they will be through this 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.319
 Percent of crystals in here are energetically charged 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.349
 and then the water drips out here down here in this container 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 and we have thereby lifted high energetic allow 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.190
 so now there is a second Kato already ordering us now before you 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.550
 just like that 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.570
 the one 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.100
 two that was a new development et was once called 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.940
 about fear 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.430
 for the KatHO as well work just left the coal which is now up here 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.270
 they just need more 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 around 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.550
 So it has a very high filter capacity 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.480
 and the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.500
 Stories that are red are also a little bit different arranged 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.530
 this is called 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.720
 Finishing additional filters have an even higher energy capability 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.049
 leave 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.480
 so that means 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.350
 Percent the water we go through 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 Fries z is also raised in ph value even further 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.570
 I usually say the water is about seven in ph value 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.150
 that is the neutral one 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.840
 but and here says Michi is raised by 1 to 1 Cor 5 so that's 8 or 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 something over 8 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.940
 So the water is obviously safe and secure 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.780
 Of course our body did not have to be that essential 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.040
 our blood 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.869
 and so blood percent is also base price 7 point fire and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.700
 so it is always checked exactly had Sachs exactly at 7 Kommer 4 remains 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.890
 and of course our tissue should be over seven 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.430
 but unfortunately, of course it is through 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.370
 different bad diet 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.689
 but that our tissue is natural 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.120
 on 42 and therefore my husband says so should try very hard 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.659
 to take food and water, and so on 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.559
 one 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:12.329
 Alba is in the basic range and is missing about 1 chaotic 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.319
 Of course now the possibility of the water 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.339
 to make it more basic 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:20.479
 Both the approximately 1 leads of the critical will of course be used as well 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.569
 a bit expensive 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.999
 So it gets easier just like here 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.159
 used 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.689
 so I want to show it again 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.689
 you just screw it on here 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.259
 8 ob 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 if 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.649
 now there are still cold colder 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.419
 and Dirk Altkrüger is of course always gladly taken when the water 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.079
 is relatively calcareous 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.389
 at the region 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.789
 the conventional creamy cartridge is around 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.359
 around the filter material like that 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.669
 that actually the lime is filtered out quite well, we now have the 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.089
 new Antoines cartridge 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.889
 percent 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.430
 then the lime filter should be built in with the ones up here 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.470
 simply used it is actually screwed 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.019
 there is an extra 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.759
 Price shock closure 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.689
 and 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.339
 Percent the filling of this calculus that you can always refill 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.230
 and Dirk Altkrüger will be included 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.970
 with this about the KAP spilled that is so if we ETA new about 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.129
 the chateau already then should be a calculus of it 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.040
 but we do not need a Mineral Steiner, I'll show you later 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.040
 if we have the conventional bonuses cartouche 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.899
 get up here next to the afternoon 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.159
 Percent of these are special minerals that come from Korea 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.109
 Percent and the few that they left now 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.979
 so that these minerals get the water out of here 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.329
 also very basic 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.119
 Now we have the new Ansgar between 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:12.189
 we do not need the mineral stones because they are about as catholic as the water 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.389
 already basic in itself 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.400
 so fit both cartridges are screwed in the remains below 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 Everything is very simple then you put it back in here 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.370
 and this one 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.000
 Pre-filter is simply screwed here it will draw later 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.610
 screwed on again 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.800
 and you just put that but it's very easy 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.659
 It's very fast and easy to use 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:41.930
 Parts of this 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.990
 Ceramic apron, this cartridge have this right 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.520
 inexpensive 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.580
 im a buy 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.409
 and so you can put the filter somewhere then 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.029
 if you have less space you can take that lower part away too 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.169
 I also do not think again later or this upper part Prochnow 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.110
 you have to cover it up, you can also do Sum Platter but here you can 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.310
 For example, fill with water and let the water rise 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.629
 or you stand in the next 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.460
 go like that 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.520
 That's just the big filter 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.550
 and now funny in the other video as always can assemble that 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.960
 and how you can use it
