cool and that'll do it and it should be

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.320 
cool and that'll do it and it should be
about<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.350> same<00:05:25.530> XP<00:05:27.080> let's<00:05:28.080> take<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.320> peek

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
about the same XP let's take a peek

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.140 
about the same XP let's take a peek
should<00:05:30.330> be<00:05:30.420> around<00:05:30.570> 20,000<00:05:31.880> not<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:32.910> big<00:05:33.030> deal

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
should be around 20,000 not a big deal

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.540 
should be around 20,000 not a big deal
but<00:05:33.450> for<00:05:34.170> the<00:05:34.260> amount<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.500> time<00:05:34.680> it's<00:05:35.310> one<00:05:35.460> of

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
but for the amount of time it's one of

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.690 
but for the amount of time it's one of
the<00:05:35.610> fastest<00:05:36.000> ways<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.360> do<00:05:36.510> it

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.810 

160,000<00:05:41.700> spending<00:05:41.970> cash<00:05:42.120> pretty<00:05:42.360> good<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:43.820> XP

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
160,000 spending cash pretty good to XP

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:52.150 
160,000 spending cash pretty good to XP
overall<00:05:49.730> 21,000<00:05:50.730> I<00:05:50.760> think<00:05:50.910> it's<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.090> same

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
overall 21,000 I think it's the same

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.130 
overall 21,000 I think it's the same
