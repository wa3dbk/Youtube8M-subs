00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.810 
tied slit Buntline hitch I'm going to
show<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.440> so<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.530> bunt<00:00:10.710> line<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
show you now so the bunt line is is a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.189 
show you now so the bunt line is is a
good<00:00:12.179> hedge<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.719> tie<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> clue<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.219> mean<00:00:15.199> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
good hedge to tie to the clue I mean to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.750 
good hedge to tie to the clue I mean to
a<00:00:16.619> tarp<00:00:17.779> tie<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:18.990> took<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.529> out<00:00:19.680> point<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.580> your

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a tarp tie out took I out point so your

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
a tarp tie out took I out point so your
guidelines<00:00:21.150> will<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.420> tried<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:22.050> tarp

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
guidelines will be tried on to your tarp

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.380 
guidelines will be tried on to your tarp
what's<00:00:22.470> good<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.890> bunt<00:00:23.100> line<00:00:23.250> hitch<00:00:24.029> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
what's good about the bunt line hitch is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.439 
what's good about the bunt line hitch is
that<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:26.039> more<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> tarp<00:00:26.640> flaps

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that the more the tarp flaps

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
that the more the tarp flaps
the<00:00:27.720> tighter<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> hitch<00:00:28.349> gets<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.189> usually

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the tighter the hitch gets and usually

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.110 
the tighter the hitch gets and usually
that's<00:00:30.179> bad<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:31.550> if<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.730> tie<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> regular

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that's bad because if you tie a regular

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
that's bad because if you tie a regular
bunt<00:00:33.450> line<00:00:33.630> hitch<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.350> pretty<00:00:34.620> much

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
bunt line hitch then it's pretty much

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.060 
bunt line hitch then it's pretty much
impossible<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.550> undone<00:00:36.030> after<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:37.530> night

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
impossible to get undone after a night

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
impossible to get undone after a night
of<00:00:38.219> wild<00:00:38.399> flapping<00:00:39.000> however<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.960> slip<00:00:40.290> but

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of wild flapping however the slip but

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.209 
of wild flapping however the slip but
line<00:00:40.800> hitch<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:42.420> great<00:00:42.840> hitch<00:00:43.140> even<00:00:43.860> after<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
line hitch is a great hitch even after a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
line hitch is a great hitch even after a
night<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.120> wild<00:00:45.300> flapping<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.140> still<00:00:46.320> easy

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
night of wild flapping it is still easy

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.520 
night of wild flapping it is still easy
to<00:00:46.620> untie<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.059> here's<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.610 
to untie and here's how I do it so you
go<00:00:49.770> through<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.309> tarp<00:00:50.940> tie<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.840> point<00:00:52.170> or

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
go through your tarp tie out point or

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
go through your tarp tie out point or
around<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.190> spar<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.760> whatever<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
around a spar or whatever so I have the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
around a spar or whatever so I have the
standing<00:00:56.280> part<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> part

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
standing part here this is the part

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
standing part here this is the part
it'll<00:00:57.690> go<00:00:57.840> down<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> stake<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.550> at

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it'll go down to the stake and then at

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150 
it'll go down to the stake and then at
the<00:00:59.850> bitter<00:01:00.030> end<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> hand<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.949> real

like I said is pull the slip and the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
like I said is pull the slip and the
whole<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.140> comes<00:01:58.320> undone<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.920> not

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
whole thing comes undone it's not

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.179 
whole thing comes undone it's not
exploding<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> we're<00:02:00.329> whimpering<00:02:01.189> so

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
exploding but it is we're whimpering so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
exploding but it is we're whimpering so
again<00:02:02.490> around<00:02:04.520> overthrew<00:02:05.930> with<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> little

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
again around overthrew with a little

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.510 
again around overthrew with a little
practice<00:02:07.350> we'll<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.770> able<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.920> tie<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
practice we'll be able to tie this in a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.710 
practice we'll be able to tie this in a
couple<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.910> seconds<00:02:09.470> very<00:02:10.470> simple

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
couple of seconds very simple

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.180 
couple of seconds very simple
once<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.350> get<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:15.620> course<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.980> tie<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
once you get it of course to tie the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.620 
once you get it of course to tie the
conventional<00:02:16.790> about<00:02:16.880> line<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.240> do<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> same

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
conventional about line you do the same

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.940 
conventional about line you do the same
thing<00:02:17.840> except<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.260> don't<00:02:18.350> push<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> bite

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
thing except you don't push a bite

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
thing except you don't push a bite
through<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.940> push<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.420> bitter<00:02:20.630> end<00:02:20.900> all<00:02:21.080> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
through you push that bitter end all the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.010 
through you push that bitter end all the
way<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:22.370> can<00:02:22.550> see<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:23.000> especially<00:02:23.660> once

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
way in you can see there especially once

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.340 
way in you can see there especially once
we<00:02:24.080> turn<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.440> over<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.850> structure<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
we turn it over the structure of the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.660 
we turn it over the structure of the
bunt<00:02:27.560> line<00:02:27.740> well<00:02:28.250> more<00:02:28.790> closely<00:02:29.860> yeah<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.520> can

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
bunt line well more closely yeah you can

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.700 
bunt line well more closely yeah you can
see<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.880> right<00:02:32.030> there<00:02:32.060> anyway<00:02:32.810> that's<00:02:33.530> it

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710
