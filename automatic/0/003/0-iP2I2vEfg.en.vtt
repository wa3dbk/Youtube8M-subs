you're gonna find out which one I think

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.180 
you're gonna find out which one I think
it's<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> best<00:00:16.529> since<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> way<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.039> and

it's the best since the way that and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.410 
it's the best since the way that and
also<00:00:17.279> let<00:00:17.520> me<00:00:17.550> know<00:00:17.640> if<00:00:17.760> there's<00:00:18.090> any<00:00:18.330> other

specific game you want to sleep hope

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.400 
specific game you want to sleep hope
it's<00:00:21.180> good<00:00:21.420> if<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> graph<00:00:22.260> of

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it's good if it's like a graph of

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.429 
it's good if it's like a graph of
intense<00:00:22.710> gaming<00:00:23.060> wet-bulb<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.480> platforms<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
intense gaming wet-bulb of platforms I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.400 
intense gaming wet-bulb of platforms I
was<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.310> Android<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.510> wanna<00:00:27.930> start<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
was an Android so I wanna start with the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040 
was an Android so I wanna start with the
worst<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.939> perfectly<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
worst one here I think perfectly in the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.220 
worst one here I think perfectly in the
in<00:00:31.349> terms<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.920> performance<00:00:32.600> even<00:00:33.600> though<00:00:33.750> all

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
in terms of performance even though all

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.500 
in terms of performance even though all
of<00:00:34.260> these<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.739> high-end<00:00:34.980> phones<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
of these are high-end phones and it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
of these are high-end phones and it
phone<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.350> well<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.800> they're

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
phone really really well but they're

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.400 
phone really really well but they're
really<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.340> close<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> top<00:00:39.600> but

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
really really close there at the top but

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.680 
really really close there at the top but
someone<00:00:40.710> has<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> winner<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:42.360> always

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
someone has to be a winner that's always

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.639 
someone has to be a winner that's always
how<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> sort<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> hear<00:00:45.750> made<00:00:46.200> 7

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
how it is so to sort of hear made 7

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.680 
how it is so to sort of hear made 7
that's<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.030> last<00:00:48.360> place

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that's gonna be the one that last place

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.610 
that's gonna be the one that last place
and<00:00:49.219> even<00:00:50.219> though<00:00:50.780> suitably<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.170> quality

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and even though suitably really quality

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
and even though suitably really quality
phones<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.530> kind

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
phones I have here but you can see kind

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.930 
phones I have here but you can see kind
of<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.219> terms<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.730> performance<00:00:58.940> you'll

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
of like in terms of performance you'll

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.420 
of like in terms of performance you'll
be<00:01:00.239> able<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:02.100> much

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
be able to see that it's not that much

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.590 
be able to see that it's not that much
up<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.670> par<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.350> these<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.619> bad<00:01:04.860> boys<00:01:05.600> even

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
up to par with these other bad boys even

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
up to par with these other bad boys even
though<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> title<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> core<00:01:07.860> processor

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
though the title of the core processor

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
though the title of the core processor
and<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> it's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and all that but it's not just that it's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.640 
and all that but it's not just that it's
that<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.130> play<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.380> interesting

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that it's play it's not that interesting

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.960 
that it's play it's not that interesting
so<00:01:17.960> when<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> move<00:01:19.530> around<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.369> feel<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so when I move around here I feel that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.380 
so when I move around here I feel that
you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.799> definitely<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> best

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you know it's definitely not the best

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.630 
you know it's definitely not the best
performance<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> boring

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.510 

but<00:01:34.640> here<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:35.030> can<00:01:35.240> play<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:39.280> probably<00:01:40.280> play

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
but here you can play but probably play

00:01:40.520 --> 00:02:08.499 
but here you can play but probably play
this<00:01:40.700> game<00:01:40.970> on<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.300> one<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> yeah<00:02:08.030> quickly

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
this game on this one so yeah quickly

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.520 
this game on this one so yeah quickly
look<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:08.929> at<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.380> mate7<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.660> second<00:02:12.050> one

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
look there at the mate7 the second one

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.740 
look there at the mate7 the second one
he<00:02:12.800> ever<00:02:13.010> gonna<00:02:13.130> pick<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.910> becomes<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.630> little

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
he ever gonna pick that becomes a little

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.650 
he ever gonna pick that becomes a little
bit<00:02:14.989> before<00:02:15.709> he<00:02:16.370> made<00:02:16.550> seven<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.360> was

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
bit before he made seven that's that was

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.520 
bit before he made seven that's that was
gonna<00:02:17.780> be<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:17.989> note<00:02:18.350> for<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:20.230> was<00:02:21.230> actually<00:02:21.350> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
gonna be the note for I was actually a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.930 
gonna be the note for I was actually a
little<00:02:21.739> bit<00:02:21.860> surprised<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.489> did<00:02:22.670> take

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
little bit surprised that I did take

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.710 
little bit surprised that I did take
this<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:24.560> step<00:02:25.489> one<00:02:25.730> because<00:02:26.270> sometimes

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
this one as a step one because sometimes

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
this one as a step one because sometimes
it<00:02:26.930> comes<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.320> second<00:02:27.680> place<00:02:27.770> when<00:02:28.070> I'm<00:02:28.160> doing

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it comes in second place when I'm doing

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.650 
it comes in second place when I'm doing
these<00:02:28.520> videos<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.420> thought<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:31.660> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
these videos but I thought it was that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.710 
these videos but I thought it was that
it<00:02:32.780> was<00:02:32.989> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.980> here<00:02:34.340> at<00:02:34.489> third<00:02:35.330> place

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
it was going to be here at third place

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.750 
it was going to be here at third place
is<00:02:35.989> because<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> quality<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.340> got<00:02:37.549> on

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
is because of the quality that I got on

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.930 
is because of the quality that I got on
some<00:02:37.970> other<00:02:38.660> devices<00:02:39.140> here<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.489> one<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.910> a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
some other devices here so this one is a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.680 
some other devices here so this one is a
little<00:02:47.239> bit<00:02:47.330> smaller<00:02:47.890> than<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.340> mate7<00:02:49.730> but

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
little bit smaller than the mate7 but

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.289 
little bit smaller than the mate7 but
the<00:02:51.230> performance<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.040> much<00:02:52.220> better<00:02:52.459> -

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
the performance is so much better -

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.880 
the performance is so much better -
there's<00:02:53.570> no<00:02:53.750> sweetness<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.530> also<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
there's no sweetness and also the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.560 
there's no sweetness and also the
display<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.910> more<00:02:56.420> better<00:02:56.870> sharper<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:59.239> sound

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
display is more better sharper the sound

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.080 
display is more better sharper the sound
may<00:03:00.170> not<00:03:00.380> be<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.739> custom<00:03:01.370> camera<00:03:01.670> feature

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
may not be that custom camera feature

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.020 
may not be that custom camera feature
but<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.350> overall<00:03:03.680> quality<00:03:03.980> here<00:03:04.430> definitely

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
but the overall quality here definitely

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.780 
but the overall quality here definitely
better

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.190

here<00:03:53.100> even<00:03:53.490> though<00:03:53.640> they<00:03:53.850> have<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> thing<00:03:54.210> of

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
here even though they have a thing of

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.660 
here even though they have a thing of
interest<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:55.620> could<00:03:55.800> be<00:03:55.950> because<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:56.580> is

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
interest it could be because this one is

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.270 
interest it could be because this one is
running<00:03:56.880> outside<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.630> mode<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:58.710> feels<00:03:59.160> a

running outside you mode it just feels a
little<00:03:59.340> bit<00:03:59.490> better<00:03:59.960> and<00:04:00.960> then<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.710> biggest

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
little bit better and then the biggest

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.190 
little bit better and then the biggest
size<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.580> definitely<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> nice<00:04:03.330> little<00:04:03.990> thing

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
size is definitely a nice little thing

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.270 
size is definitely a nice little thing
here

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.760 

I<00:04:12.310> mean<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.210> feels<00:04:13.540> amazing<00:04:13.810> with<00:04:14.590> this

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
I mean this feels amazing with this

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.729 
I mean this feels amazing with this
display<00:04:15.070> slice<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.840> display<00:04:17.440> quality

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
display slice and you display quality

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:34.380 
display slice and you display quality
inside<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.519> this<00:04:18.640> specific<00:04:18.880> game<00:04:33.390> actually

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
inside of this specific game actually

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.270 
inside of this specific game actually
now<00:04:34.810> when<00:04:34.990> I'm<00:04:35.110> saying<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.800> remember<00:04:35.950> I

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
now when I'm saying it I remember I

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.920 
now when I'm saying it I remember I
picked<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.730> one<00:04:36.790> actually<00:04:37.150> as<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.600> first

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
picked this one actually as the first

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.890 
picked this one actually as the first
place<00:04:38.380> not<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.920> second<00:04:39.310> place<00:04:39.900> actually

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
place not the second place actually

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.920 
place not the second place actually
think<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.290> iPhone<00:04:41.710> that's<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.070> second<00:04:42.460> place

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
think the iPhone that's the second place

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.890 
think the iPhone that's the second place
from<00:04:43.930> here<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:45.580> because<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:46.270> game<00:04:46.600> key<00:04:46.810> of

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
from here just because this game key of

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.320 
from here just because this game key of
many<00:04:47.169> things<00:04:47.620> on<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.070> 6-inch<00:04:48.550> display<00:04:48.700> and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
many things on the 6-inch display and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.290 
many things on the 6-inch display and
also<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.200> display<00:04:50.560> feels<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.580> little<00:04:52.120> bit

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
also the display feels a little bit

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.180 
also the display feels a little bit
sharper<00:04:52.660> here<00:04:54.210> compared<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.620> what<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.800> get

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
sharper here compared to what I do get

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.340 
sharper here compared to what I do get
here<00:04:57.640> on<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.300> iPhone<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:58.840> let's<00:04:59.020> take<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.260> look

here on the iPhone so let's take a look
here<00:04:59.560> -<00:04:59.770> I<00:04:59.800> found<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.400> picked<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.880> second

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270
