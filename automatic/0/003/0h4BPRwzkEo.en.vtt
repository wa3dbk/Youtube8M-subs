with<00:00:04.890> another<00:00:05.490> video<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.390> how<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.720> improve

your<00:00:07.319> game<00:00:07.560> with<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.099> little<00:00:08.880> tip<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.330> most

sensitivity now most sensitive T is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.200 
sensitivity now most sensitive T is
something<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> believe<00:00:13.590> most<00:00:14.309> if<00:00:14.730> not<00:00:14.790> all

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
something that I believe most if not all

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
something that I believe most if not all
players<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.230> may<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.560> little<00:00:16.710> bold<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
players that may be a little bold that a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.130 
players that may be a little bold that a
lot<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.580> players<00:00:17.789> don't<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.420> understand

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
lot of players don't really understand

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
lot of players don't really understand
most<00:00:19.560> sensitivity<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.330> shooters

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
most sensitivity and a lot of shooters

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.349 
most sensitivity and a lot of shooters
I've<00:00:21.810> played<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.320> both<00:00:22.680> console<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.369> PC<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.060> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I've played on both console and PC it is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.820 
I've played on both console and PC it is
generally<00:00:24.869> considered<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
generally considered that if you have a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.679 
generally considered that if you have a
higher<00:00:26.070> sensitivity<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.300> play<00:00:27.510> on

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
higher sensitivity and you can play on

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.679 
higher sensitivity and you can play on
it<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:28.289> you're<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> better<00:00:28.830> player<00:00:29.250> why<00:00:29.789> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
it then you're a better player why so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
it then you're a better player why so
the<00:00:31.320> reasoning<00:00:31.740> behind<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.579> if

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the reasoning behind that is really if

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.280 
the reasoning behind that is really if
you're<00:00:33.390> running<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.870> start<00:00:34.200> getting

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you're running and you start getting

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
you're running and you start getting
shot<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> back<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.160> turn<00:00:35.340> around<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
shot in the back you can turn around and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.290 
shot in the back you can turn around and
take<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> guy<00:00:36.570> before<00:00:36.960> he<00:00:37.260> kills<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.710> now

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
take out the guy before he kills you now

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
take out the guy before he kills you now
let's<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.510> stop<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.649> for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
let's just stop and think about that for

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.940 
let's just stop and think about that for
a<00:00:41.100> minute<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:43.469> where's<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
a minute that is not like where's the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
a minute that is not like where's the
reasoning<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.690> your

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
reasoning with that your that your

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
reasoning with that your that your
reasoning<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.829> crouched<00:00:47.579> over

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
reasoning that you can be crouched over

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.910 
reasoning that you can be crouched over
aiming-down-sights<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.379> someone<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.770> come

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
aiming-down-sights and someone can come

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
aiming-down-sights and someone can come
up<00:00:50.039> behind<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.460> start<00:00:51.329> putting<00:00:51.629> bullets<00:00:51.989> into

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
up behind you start putting bullets into

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
up behind you start putting bullets into
your<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.460> enough<00:00:53.699> time<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
your back and you have enough time to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.270 
your back and you have enough time to
think<00:00:54.270> okay<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.750> getting<00:00:54.930> shot<00:00:55.199> my<00:00:55.350> back<00:00:55.500> I'm

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
think okay I'm getting shot my back I'm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
think okay I'm getting shot my back I'm
gonna<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:56.699> around<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.270> gonna<00:00:58.050> aim<00:00:58.199> down

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
gonna turn around I'm gonna aim down

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.349 
gonna turn around I'm gonna aim down
sights<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.550> start<00:00:59.789> shooting<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.239> them

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
sights I'm gonna start shooting at them

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
sights I'm gonna start shooting at them
and<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.770> before<00:01:02.309> he<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and I'm gonna do all that before he can

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.039 
and I'm gonna do all that before he can
kill<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.149> he's<00:01:03.270> already<00:01:03.780> putting

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
kill me when he's already putting

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649 
kill me when he's already putting
bullets<00:01:04.409> into<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:05.150> seriously

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bullets into my back seriously

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.560 
bullets into my back seriously
nine-time<00:01:07.650> looking<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:09.000> 99

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
nine-time looking more like like 99

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

times out of 100 that guy's gonna kill
you<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.049> stupid

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you first that it's just stupid

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
you first that it's just stupid
reasoning<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.210> engagements<00:01:15.840> don't

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
reasoning your your engagements don't

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
reasoning your your engagements don't
happen<00:01:16.560> behind<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.520> engagements<00:01:18.090> they

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
happen behind you your engagements they

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
happen behind you your engagements they
happen<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:18.960> field<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> view<00:01:19.619> almost

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
happen in your field of view almost

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
happen in your field of view almost
everything<00:01:20.670> you'll<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.970> aiming<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.420> will<00:01:22.170> be

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
everything you'll be aiming at will be

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
everything you'll be aiming at will be
in<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.680> field<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.159> view<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:23.670> need<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
in your field of view you don't need to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.050 
in your field of view you don't need to
do<00:01:24.119> crazy<00:01:24.960> 180s<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.890> stuff<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.850> guys

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
do crazy 180s and stuff to take out guys

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
do crazy 180s and stuff to take out guys
that's<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:28.110> smart<00:01:28.290> reasoning<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that's just not smart reasoning and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.280 
that's just not smart reasoning and
that's<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.840> common

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's it it's a really common

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
that's it it's a really common
unfortunately<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.670> simply<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.119> true

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
unfortunately but it's simply not true

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.780 
unfortunately but it's simply not true
like<00:01:33.869> higher<00:01:34.619> sensitivity<00:01:34.979> does<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.549> mean

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
like higher sensitivity does not mean

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.319 
like higher sensitivity does not mean
you're<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> better<00:01:36.210> player<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:38.329> here's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you're a better player so like here's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.499 
you're a better player so like here's
you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.229> here's<00:01:40.560> my<00:01:40.650> reasoning<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.509> I'm

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you know here's my reasoning so I'm

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.440 
you know here's my reasoning so I'm
going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> argue<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.460> lower<00:01:44.460> sensitivity<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
going to argue they lower sensitivity is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.179 
going to argue they lower sensitivity is
better<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:46.740> why<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> said

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
better now why is that because as I said

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
better now why is that because as I said
most<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.420> engagements<00:01:52.020> are

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
most if not all of your engagements are

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
most if not all of your engagements are
going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.890> area<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:54.149> field

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
going to be in this area in your field

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.170 
going to be in this area in your field
of<00:01:54.899> view<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.909> you're<00:01:57.060> gonna

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
of view so the things that you're gonna

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
of view so the things that you're gonna
be<00:01:57.329> shooting<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:58.259> gonna<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.799> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
be shooting at are gonna be right in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.200 
be shooting at are gonna be right in
front<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> practice<00:02:00.000> being

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
front of you you want to practice being

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.670 
front of you you want to practice being
moving<00:02:00.509> between<00:02:00.810> these<00:02:00.990> two<00:02:01.200> things<00:02:01.469> really

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
moving between these two things really

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
moving between these two things really
quickly<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.670> need<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> practice<00:02:03.360> doing

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
quickly you don't need to practice doing

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
quickly you don't need to practice doing
a<00:02:03.750> 180<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.590> quickly<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.159> that's<00:02:05.729> not

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
a 180 really quickly that's that's not

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.779 
a 180 really quickly that's that's not
really<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> low

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
really in it so like what is the low

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
really in it so like what is the low
sensitivity<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> suitable

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
sensitivity like what is a suitable

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.730 
sensitivity like what is a suitable
sensitivity<00:02:11.459> rather<00:02:11.640> well

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
sensitivity rather well

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.590 
sensitivity rather well
you<00:02:13.130> can't<00:02:13.400> really<00:02:13.760> judge<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.150> because<00:02:14.420> it's

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
you can't really judge it because it's

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.300 
you can't really judge it because it's
just<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.870> percentage<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.590> game<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.010> everyone

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
just a percentage in game and everyone

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.000 
just a percentage in game and everyone
has<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.460> different<00:02:16.640> dpi<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.390> such<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.890> way

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
has a different dpi and such but the way

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.290 
has a different dpi and such but the way
I<00:02:19.040> play<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.730> play<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.780> do<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.260> full<00:02:22.090> 360<00:02:23.090> like

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
I play I play to do one full 360 like

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.130 
I play I play to do one full 360 like
this<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.930> move<00:02:24.830> my<00:02:25.160> most<00:02:25.460> three<00:02:26.000> inches<00:02:26.360> across

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
this I move my most three inches across

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.320 
this I move my most three inches across
my<00:02:27.440> mouse<00:02:27.620> pad<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:27.920> yes<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:29.150> measured

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
my mouse pad and yes I have measured

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.750 
my mouse pad and yes I have measured
that<00:02:29.660> with<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> ruler<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:31.010> accurate<00:02:31.310> now

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
that with a ruler that is accurate now

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.510 
that with a ruler that is accurate now
what<00:02:32.600> does<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.720> value<00:02:33.140> actually<00:02:33.320> well<00:02:33.830> my

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
what does that value actually well my

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.260 
what does that value actually well my
dpi<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.210> 1800<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.290> my<00:02:36.860> in-game<00:02:37.190> sensitivity<00:02:38.090> I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
dpi is 1800 and my in-game sensitivity I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.640 
dpi is 1800 and my in-game sensitivity I
will<00:02:38.660> pull<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.990> up<00:02:39.110> right<00:02:39.290> here

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
will pull it up right here

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.300 
will pull it up right here
16<00:02:40.520> percent<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:41.660> that's<00:02:42.410> pretty<00:02:42.680> low<00:02:42.950> when<00:02:43.250> I

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
16 percent now that's pretty low when I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.550 
16 percent now that's pretty low when I
first<00:02:43.640> started<00:02:43.880> using<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.900> was<00:02:45.080> crazy<00:02:45.410> I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
first started using this it was crazy I

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.890 
first started using this it was crazy I
didn't<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.670> stuck<00:02:47.210> with<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.420> now<00:02:47.720> I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
didn't like it I stuck with it now I

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.810 
didn't like it I stuck with it now I
love<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.560> can't<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.950> don't<00:02:49.070> know<00:02:49.280> how<00:02:49.460> I<00:02:49.490> used

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
love it I can't I don't know how I used

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.300 
love it I can't I don't know how I used
to<00:02:49.880> play<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.150> high<00:02:50.450> sensitivity<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.590> mean

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to play on high sensitivity so I mean

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.040 
to play on high sensitivity so I mean
you<00:02:52.640> want<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.820> practice<00:02:53.060> shooting<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
you want to practice shooting that and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.450 
you want to practice shooting that and
then<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.590> then<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.190> then<00:02:55.250> this

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
then this and then that and then this

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.370 
then this and then that and then this
except<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.000> missed<00:02:56.240> that<00:02:56.390> one<00:02:56.570> there<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.200> want

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
except I missed that one there you want

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.840 
except I missed that one there you want
to<00:02:57.470> practice<00:02:57.680> shooting<00:02:58.040> things<00:02:58.400> there<00:02:58.700> in

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
to practice shooting things there in

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.920 
to practice shooting things there in
your<00:02:58.970> field<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.330> view<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.480> oughta<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.750> able<00:02:59.810> to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
your field of view you oughta be able to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
your field of view you oughta be able to
move<00:03:00.020> between<00:03:00.170> these<00:03:00.410> two<00:03:00.590> things<00:03:00.770> really

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
move between these two things really

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.920 
move between these two things really
quickly<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.820> want<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.000> move<00:03:02.150> between<00:03:02.390> things

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
quickly you want to move between things

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.990 
quickly you want to move between things
far<00:03:03.260> off<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.680> real<00:03:04.130> engagements<00:03:04.910> say

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
far off like real engagements say

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.940 
far off like real engagements say
there's<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.240> guy<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:05.570> behind<00:03:05.960> there<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.380> there

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
there's a guy but behind there and there

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.290 
there's a guy but behind there and there
you<00:03:07.100> wanna<00:03:07.250> move<00:03:07.340> back<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.760> forth<00:03:07.970> back<00:03:08.270> and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
forth back and forth you want to be able

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.130 
forth back and forth you want to be able
to<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.190> quickly<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.880> accurately<00:03:11.630> and

to do that quickly and accurately and
when<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.350> have<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> high<00:03:12.620> sensitivity<00:03:12.920> do<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:13.910> -

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
when you have a high sensitivity do is -

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.460 
when you have a high sensitivity do is -
here<00:03:14.240> let<00:03:14.390> me<00:03:14.420> let<00:03:14.840> me<00:03:14.870> turn<00:03:15.140> up<00:03:15.200> my

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
here let me let me turn up my

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.990 
here let me let me turn up my
sensitivity<00:03:15.980> no<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.310> don't<00:03:16.490> want<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.670> quit<00:03:16.910> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
sensitivity no I don't want to quit the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.680 
sensitivity no I don't want to quit the
game<00:03:17.180> I'll<00:03:17.870> turn<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.140> up<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> 50%<00:03:19.690> obviously

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
game I'll turn it up to 50% obviously

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.080 
game I'll turn it up to 50% obviously
I'm<00:03:20.780> not<00:03:20.900> gonna<00:03:21.050> be<00:03:21.170> used<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:22.520> you

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
I'm not gonna be used to this like you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.150 
I'm not gonna be used to this like you
can<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:23.630> tell<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:23.870> how<00:03:24.710> are<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.890> supposed

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
can just tell like how are you supposed

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.550 
can just tell like how are you supposed
to<00:03:25.190> aim<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:25.970> like<00:03:26.750> back<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.500> forth

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
to aim with this like back and forth

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.380 
to aim with this like back and forth
like<00:03:27.860> I'm<00:03:28.010> overshooting<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.820> crazy<00:03:29.150> this

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
like I'm overshooting it like crazy this

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.540 
like I'm overshooting it like crazy this
sensitivity<00:03:30.290> it's<00:03:30.590> too<00:03:30.800> high<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.280> higher

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
sensitivity it's too high a higher

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.580 
sensitivity it's too high a higher
sensitivity<00:03:31.880> well<00:03:32.450> sure<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:32.960> big<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.320> oh

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
sensitivity well sure you can big the oh

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.770 
sensitivity well sure you can big the oh
and<00:03:34.010> do<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.430> quick<00:03:34.940> turn<00:03:35.180> around<00:03:35.240> like<00:03:35.600> crazy

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
and do a quick turn around like crazy

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.140 
and do a quick turn around like crazy
that's<00:03:36.200> not<00:03:36.410> gonna<00:03:36.650> improve<00:03:37.190> your<00:03:37.370> game<00:03:37.610> it's

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
that's not gonna improve your game it's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.130 
that's not gonna improve your game it's
not<00:03:38.300> gonna<00:03:38.390> make<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.720> better<00:03:38.930> player

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
not gonna make you a better player

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.440 
not gonna make you a better player
that's<00:03:39.680> gonna<00:03:39.800> make<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> more<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.910> less

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
that's gonna make you a more a less

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.240 
that's gonna make you a more a less
accurate<00:03:41.750> player<00:03:42.290> that's<00:03:42.620> not<00:03:42.800> gonna<00:03:42.950> improve

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
accurate player that's not gonna improve

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.270 
accurate player that's not gonna improve
your<00:03:43.310> game<00:03:43.670> at<00:03:43.880> all<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.480> as<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.410> said<00:03:45.650> lower

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
your game at all so as I said lower

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.500 
your game at all so as I said lower
sensitivity<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.090> better

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
sensitivity is better

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.110 
sensitivity is better
I<00:03:47.690> plan<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.260> three<00:03:48.560> inches<00:03:48.770> if<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.520> know<00:03:49.700> level

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
I plan on three inches if you know level

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.000 
I plan on three inches if you know level
cap<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.570> know<00:03:50.660> he<00:03:51.080> made<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> video<00:03:51.500> when<00:03:51.740> he<00:03:51.770> plays

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
cap I know he made a video when he plays

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.830 
cap I know he made a video when he plays
on<00:03:52.190> four<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.520> a<00:03:52.550> half<00:03:52.580> inches<00:03:53.240> which<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.660> mean

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
on four and a half inches which I mean

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.140 
on four and a half inches which I mean
that's<00:03:54.260> still<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.740> pretty<00:03:55.040> crazy<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.490> I<00:03:55.850> I

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
that's still it's pretty crazy and I I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.180 
that's still it's pretty crazy and I I
mean<00:03:56.870> that'll<00:03:57.260> take<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.440> while<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.770> get<00:03:57.890> used<00:03:57.920> to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
mean that'll take a while to get used to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.160 
mean that'll take a while to get used to
but<00:03:58.520> that's<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.570> thing<00:03:59.600> lower

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
but that's just the thing lower

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.320 
but that's just the thing lower
sensitivity<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:01.130> really<00:04:01.730> where<00:04:01.970> it's<00:04:02.120> at

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
sensitivity is really where it's at

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.910 
sensitivity is really where it's at
that's<00:04:02.540> where<00:04:02.900> you're<00:04:03.020> gonna<00:04:03.110> get<00:04:03.320> those<00:04:03.530> long

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
that's where you're gonna get those long

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.010 
that's where you're gonna get those long
distance<00:04:04.340> kills<00:04:04.640> because<00:04:04.910> sure<00:04:05.690> close

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
distance kills because sure close

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.990 
distance kills because sure close
distance<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:07.190> get<00:04:07.340> away<00:04:07.460> with<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.850> high

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
distance you can get away with the high

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.580 
distance you can get away with the high
sensitivity<00:04:08.450> but<00:04:08.750> when<00:04:08.900> you're<00:04:09.050> taking<00:04:09.410> down

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
sensitivity but when you're taking down

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.890 
sensitivity but when you're taking down
guys<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.610> are<00:04:10.700> way<00:04:10.850> back<00:04:11.030> there<00:04:11.360> you<00:04:11.690> want<00:04:11.840> a

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
guys that are way back there you want a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.720 
guys that are way back there you want a
low<00:04:12.050> sensitivity<00:04:12.440> because<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.430> want<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.610> feel

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
low sensitivity because you want to feel

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.030 
low sensitivity because you want to feel
the<00:04:13.850> aim<00:04:13.970> down<00:04:14.180> guys<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:15.140> are<00:04:15.230> far<00:04:15.500> away<00:04:15.530> and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
the aim down guys that are far away and

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.470 
the aim down guys that are far away and
you<00:04:16.280> want<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.489> be<00:04:16.549> as<00:04:16.730> accurate<00:04:17.090> as<00:04:17.420> possible

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
you want to be as accurate as possible

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.420 
you want to be as accurate as possible
and<00:04:18.170> you're<00:04:18.500> gonna<00:04:18.650> need<00:04:18.890> to<00:04:19.010> make<00:04:19.160> really

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
and you're gonna need to make really

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.979 
and you're gonna need to make really
small<00:04:19.700> adjustments<00:04:20.330> that<00:04:20.480> simply<00:04:20.750> aren't

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
small adjustments that simply aren't

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.950 
small adjustments that simply aren't
possible<00:04:21.650> with<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.830> high<00:04:22.010> sensitivity<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.780> guys

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
possible with a high sensitivity so guys

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.659 
possible with a high sensitivity so guys
that's<00:04:24.169> been<00:04:24.290> my<00:04:24.440> quick<00:04:24.680> rant<00:04:25.010> on<00:04:25.190> most

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
that's been my quick rant on most

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.660 
that's been my quick rant on most

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
ever advise going for a high-sensitivity
