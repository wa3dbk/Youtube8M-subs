all I'm using the assault kit and I'm
using<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.089> very<00:00:15.330> cheap<00:00:16.289> loadout<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.100> today's

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
using a very cheap loadout in today's

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.970 
using a very cheap loadout in today's
video<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.480> intentional<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.680> feel

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
video and it's intentional and I feel

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189 
video and it's intentional and I feel
bad<00:00:20.220> about<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.510> want<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> word

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
bad about it but I want to get the word

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.140 
bad about it but I want to get the word
out<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.250> because<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.970> honestly

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
out about this because I honestly

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.410 
out about this because I honestly
believe<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.869> dice<00:00:25.699> needs<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.970> fix<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
believe that dice needs to fix this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
believe that dice needs to fix this
sooner<00:00:28.199> rather<00:00:28.380> than<00:00:28.619> later<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.760> is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
sooner rather than later because it is

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.569 
sooner rather than later because it is
broken<00:00:30.390> right<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:31.160> I'm<00:00:32.160> using<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.020> m16a3

post<00:00:48.059> patch<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.340> completely<00:00:50.730> broken<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
post patch but it is completely broken I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.139 
post patch but it is completely broken I
don't<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> range<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
don't know if it's just the range that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.110 
don't know if it's just the range that
got<00:00:54.360> increased<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.320> buffed<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
got increased or buffed or if it's the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
got increased or buffed or if it's the
fall-off<00:00:57.390> damage<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
fall-off damage or if it's just the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.009 
fall-off damage or if it's just the
total<00:00:59.879> damage<00:01:00.410> but<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.160> kill

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
total damage but this thing can kill

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
total damage but this thing can kill
from<00:01:04.019> basically<00:01:04.500> across<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> map<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.360> don't

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
from basically across the map you don't

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.670 
from basically across the map you don't
have<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> aim<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.900> ridiculous

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have to aim and it it's just ridiculous

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.730 
have to aim and it it's just ridiculous
so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.479> don't<00:01:12.479> recommend<00:01:12.780> using<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.439> setup

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so I don't recommend using this setup

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
so I don't recommend using this setup
more<00:01:14.549> than<00:01:14.729> once<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.299> twice<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
more than once or twice because it is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100 
more than once or twice because it is
very<00:01:16.619> cheap<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.640> fair<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.390> people

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
very cheap and it's not fair to people

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.130 
very cheap and it's not fair to people
on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> other<00:01:19.590> team<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.540> if<00:01:21.540> you're<00:01:21.780> curious

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
on the other team but if you're curious

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
on the other team but if you're curious
just<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:23.280> sorts<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.420> havoc<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:26.000> affect

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
just what sorts of havoc you can affect

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
just what sorts of havoc you can affect
on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> battlefield<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.140> using<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> setup

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
on the battlefield when using the setup

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
on the battlefield when using the setup
I<00:01:28.979> mean<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:30.200> before<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I mean just look at that before the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.929 
I mean just look at that before the
patch<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.680> probably<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.040> taken<00:01:32.159> 4<00:01:32.640> or

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
patch it probably would have taken 4 or

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.810 
patch it probably would have taken 4 or
5<00:01:33.210> hits<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.500> kill<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.890> guy<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> range

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
5 hits to kill that guy at that range

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.569 
5 hits to kill that guy at that range
with<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.390> weapon<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> takes<00:01:37.979> 2<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
with this weapon but now it takes 2 and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069 
with this weapon but now it takes 2 and
if<00:01:38.939> you're<00:01:39.090> lucky<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.750> hit<00:01:39.869> them<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
if you're lucky if you hit them in the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.639 
if you're lucky if you hit them in the
head<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.860> takes<00:01:41.009> 1<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.049> insane

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
head it just takes 1 and that is insane

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.609 
head it just takes 1 and that is insane
and<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.479> revived<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and right here I get revived out of the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.010 
and right here I get revived out of the
combat<00:01:46.829> area<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.579> run<00:01:48.149> back<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> combat

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
combat area I run back into the combat

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.060 
combat area I run back into the combat
area<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.579> filter<00:01:50.939> stays<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.290> was

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
area and the filter stays so I was

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.460 
area and the filter stays so I was
basically<00:01:53.490> playing<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> dark<00:01:54.570> during

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
basically playing in the dark during

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.860 
basically playing in the dark during
this<00:01:55.710> segment<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> match

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
this segment of the match

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.830 
this segment of the match
and<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.530> still<00:01:57.980> end<00:01:58.280> up<00:01:58.490> besting<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.570> few

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
and I still end up besting a few

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.400 
and I still end up besting a few
opponents<00:02:00.380> while<00:02:01.130> my<00:02:01.340> screen<00:02:01.640> is<00:02:01.790> like<00:02:01.910> this

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
opponents while my screen is like this

opponents while my screen is like this
so<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.440> should<00:02:03.740> give<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.980> good<00:02:04.190> idea<00:02:04.220> of

so that should give you a good idea of
just<00:02:05.270> how<00:02:06.110> overpowered<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.980> setup<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.520> you

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
just how overpowered the setup is you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.830 
just how overpowered the setup is you
don't<00:02:07.970> need<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.180> aim<00:02:08.420> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
don't need to aim it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.770 
don't need to aim it
it<00:02:08.900> fires<00:02:09.770> relatively<00:02:10.550> quickly<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.210> reloads

it fires relatively quickly it reloads
relatively<00:02:12.650> quickly<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.720> range<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.380> it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
relatively quickly and the range on it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.760 
relatively quickly and the range on it
is<00:02:15.710> just<00:02:16.190> crazy<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:17.930> you've<00:02:18.410> had<00:02:18.560> any

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
see that guy I just swung my cursor

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.440 
see that guy I just swung my cursor
around<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.110> screen<00:02:45.460> shot<00:02:46.460> randomly<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.330> I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
around the screen shot randomly and I

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.830 
around the screen shot randomly and I
was<00:02:47.570> still<00:02:47.780> able<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.050> kill<00:02:48.350> him<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.450> yeah<00:02:50.450> this

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
was still able to kill him so yeah this

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.750 
was still able to kill him so yeah this
is<00:02:50.900> basically<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.650> new<00:02:51.800> use<00:02:52.040> ass<00:02:52.220> with<00:02:52.460> frags

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
is basically the new use ass with frags

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.570 
is basically the new use ass with frags
that's<00:02:53.570> that's<00:02:54.380> what<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.680> comes<00:02:55.130> down<00:02:55.220> to

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that's that's what it comes down to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.830 
that's that's what it comes down to
basically<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:58.300> there's<00:02:59.300> no<00:02:59.450> counter

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
basically it's just there's no counter

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.220 
basically it's just there's no counter
to<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.940> insanely<00:03:02.720> effective

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
to it and it's just insanely effective

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.010 
to it and it's just insanely effective
and<00:03:03.380> requires<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.340> no<00:03:04.580> skill<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.900> know

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
and requires little to no skill you know

good in order to be super effective you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.590 
good in order to be super effective you
know<00:03:12.260> you'll<00:03:12.530> see<00:03:12.590> dozens<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.730> jet<00:03:13.970> pilots<00:03:14.420> go

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
know you'll see dozens of jet pilots go

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.570 
know you'll see dozens of jet pilots go
up<00:03:14.660> into<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> air<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.470> because<00:03:16.400> they're

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
up into the air and because they're

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.710 
up into the air and because they're
inexperienced<00:03:17.209> they<00:03:17.300> don't<00:03:17.540> know<00:03:17.630> exactly

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
inexperienced they don't know exactly

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.930 
inexperienced they don't know exactly
what<00:03:18.140> they're<00:03:18.260> doing<00:03:18.370> they'll<00:03:19.370> be<00:03:19.489> down<00:03:19.640> in<00:03:19.850> a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
what they're doing they'll be down in a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.990 
what they're doing they'll be down in a
second<00:03:20.620> when<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.800> really<00:03:21.950> good<00:03:22.220> jet<00:03:22.459> pilot<00:03:22.850> is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
second when a really good jet pilot is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.760 
second when a really good jet pilot is
in<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.450> Jets<00:03:24.550> he<00:03:25.550> can<00:03:25.700> stay<00:03:25.940> up<00:03:26.060> forever<00:03:26.330> and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
in the Jets he can stay up forever and

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.530 
in the Jets he can stay up forever and
he<00:03:27.770> may<00:03:27.920> seem<00:03:28.250> overpowered<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.390> to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
he may seem overpowered but you have to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.910 
he may seem overpowered but you have to
think<00:03:29.810> he<00:03:30.590> has<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.709> ton<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.160> skill<00:03:31.640> backing<00:03:32.450> up

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
think he has a ton of skill backing up

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.860 
think he has a ton of skill backing up
what<00:03:33.920> he's<00:03:34.130> doing<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:34.730> that's<00:03:34.970> why<00:03:35.330> he's<00:03:35.690> so

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
what he's doing and that's why he's so

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.380 
what he's doing and that's why he's so
effective<00:03:36.440> with<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.310> setup<00:03:37.610> there<00:03:38.150> is

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
effective with this setup there is

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.570 
effective with this setup there is
minimal<00:03:38.959> skill<00:03:39.320> involved<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.160> that's<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
minimal skill involved and that's the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.320 
minimal skill involved and that's the
problem<00:03:41.890> when<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.070> have<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.400> setup<00:03:43.880> that's<00:03:44.090> as

you get the same issue that you had with
the<00:03:53.600> USS<00:03:53.959> with<00:03:54.380> frags<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.450> it's<00:03:56.720> gonna

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
the USS with frags it's just it's gonna

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.979 
the USS with frags it's just it's gonna
proliferate<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.670> entire<00:03:59.000> playerbase<00:03:59.390> and
