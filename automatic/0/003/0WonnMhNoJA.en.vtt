hello guys this is wrong that piece of
professional<00:00:30.640> photography<00:00:31.119> I've<00:00:31.810> got<00:00:32.110> a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
professional photography I've got a

professional photography I've got a
number<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.559> questions<00:00:33.070> related<00:00:33.580> to<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.690> type

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
number of questions related to the type

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.150 
number of questions related to the type
of<00:00:34.900> strobes<00:00:35.260> that<00:00:35.500> we<00:00:35.590> use<00:00:35.770> here<00:00:35.800> in<00:00:36.100> the

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
of strobes that we use here in the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.640 
of strobes that we use here in the
studio<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.550> sometimes<00:00:36.970> on<00:00:37.180> location<00:00:37.720> one<00:00:38.559> of

the<00:00:38.770> more<00:00:39.660> cost<00:00:40.660> efficient<00:00:41.140> strobes<00:00:41.559> that

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
the more cost efficient strobes that

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.970 
the more cost efficient strobes that
I've<00:00:41.890> found<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:43.470> think<00:00:44.470> that<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.650> number<00:00:44.830> of

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
I've found I think that a number of

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.619 
I've found I think that a number of
people<00:00:45.040> would<00:00:45.370> be<00:00:45.519> able<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.850> afford<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.449> like

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
people would be able to afford and like

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.900 
people would be able to afford and like
would<00:00:47.290> be<00:00:47.470> alien<00:00:48.129> bees<00:00:48.340> I<00:00:48.610> don't<00:00:48.760> know<00:00:48.850> if

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
would be alien bees I don't know if

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.250 
would be alien bees I don't know if

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
thinks about them and so on now the

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.770 
thinks about them and so on now the
common<00:01:03.640> question<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.089> I<00:01:04.269> seem<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.570> get<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.720> lot

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
common question that I seem to get a lot

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.410 
common question that I seem to get a lot
is<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.350> type<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:05.950> modifiers<00:01:06.549> best<00:01:06.970> use<00:01:07.210> with

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
is the type of modifiers best use with

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.200 
is the type of modifiers best use with
these<00:01:07.600> which<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.500> better<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.159> 800<00:01:09.729> or<00:01:09.909> the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
these which is better the 800 or the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.140 
these which is better the 800 or the
1600<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.470> know<00:01:11.590> really<00:01:12.010> it<00:01:12.250> depends<00:01:12.580> on<00:01:12.820> what

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
1600 you know really it depends on what

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.840 
1600 you know really it depends on what
your<00:01:13.360> workflow<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.350> going<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.770> require<00:01:14.920> you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
your workflow is going to require you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.969 
your workflow is going to require you
know<00:01:15.970> as<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.600> which<00:01:17.470> type<00:01:17.799> of<00:01:18.330> alien<00:01:19.330> bee<00:01:19.979> model

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
know as to which type of alien bee model

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.640 
know as to which type of alien bee model
you<00:01:21.100> would<00:01:21.250> need<00:01:21.400> now<00:01:22.210> again<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:23.020> know<00:01:23.380> it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
you would need now again you know it

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
you would need now again you know it
comes<00:01:23.890> in<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.159> number<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.490> different<00:01:24.549> flavors

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
comes in a number of different flavors

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.750 
comes in a number of different flavors
1600<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.500> think<00:01:26.799> it's<00:01:26.950> probably<00:01:27.189> one<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
1600 I think it's probably one of the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.609 
1600 I think it's probably one of the
best<00:01:27.939> reason<00:01:28.270> why<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.509> went<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.929> direction<00:01:29.109> is

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
best reason why I went that direction is

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.069 
best reason why I went that direction is
that<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.399> many<00:01:30.579> cases<00:01:30.670> I'd<00:01:31.149> rather<00:01:31.329> have<00:01:31.630> too

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
that in many cases I'd rather have too

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.039 
that in many cases I'd rather have too
much<00:01:32.200> power<00:01:32.500> than<00:01:33.310> obviously<00:01:33.850> not<00:01:34.030> enough<00:01:34.179> now

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
much power than obviously not enough now

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.959 
much power than obviously not enough now
as<00:01:35.229> far<00:01:35.439> as<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.679> modifiers<00:01:36.189> go<00:01:36.520> there's<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
as far as the modifiers go there's a

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.520 
as far as the modifiers go there's a
number<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.420> different<00:01:37.539> modifiers<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.289> I'll

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
number of different modifiers and I'll

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.639 
number of different modifiers and I'll
go<00:01:38.740> over<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.030> ones<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.420> people<00:01:41.380> seem

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
go over one of the ones that people seem

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.739 
go over one of the ones that people seem
to<00:01:41.679> focus<00:01:42.189> on<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.640> most<00:01:42.850> which<00:01:43.179> is<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.450> beauty

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
to focus on the most which is the beauty

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.109 
to focus on the most which is the beauty
dish<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.399> I'll<00:01:45.399> show<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.670> here<00:01:45.909> on<00:01:45.999> their

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
beauty dish one is white which is a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.520 
beauty dish one is white which is a
little<00:01:54.369> bit<00:01:54.549> smaller<00:01:54.880> than<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:56.170> one<00:01:56.319> that<00:01:56.439> I'm

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
little bit smaller than the one that I'm

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.130 
little bit smaller than the one that I'm
showing<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.429> it<00:02:00.429> has<00:02:00.579> its<00:02:00.819> inner

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
showing you here and it has its inner

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:11.010 
showing you here and it has its inner
reflector<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:03.729> simple<00:02:04.119> construction

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.290 

and<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:12.010> other<00:02:12.190> thing<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.550> comes<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.270> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and the other thing that comes with it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.050 
and the other thing that comes with it
that<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.840> optional<00:02:14.580> depending<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.850> how<00:02:16.000> you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
that is optional depending on how you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.720 
that is optional depending on how you
would<00:02:16.330> use<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.920> saw<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.460> of<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.610> other

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
would use it is I saw one of the other

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.310 
would use it is I saw one of the other
photographers<00:02:19.330> talking<00:02:19.720> about<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.020> before

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
photographers talking about it before

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.600 
photographers talking about it before
and<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.440> guess<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.710> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> adopted<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.460> same

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
and I guess I kind of adopted the same

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.790 
and I guess I kind of adopted the same
term<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.630> know<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.780> call<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> bag<00:02:23.560> lady

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
term you know I call this the bag lady

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.150 
term you know I call this the bag lady
and<00:02:24.900> basically<00:02:25.900> what<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.440> diffusing
