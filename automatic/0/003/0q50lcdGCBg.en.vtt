00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the new growth is the part that will

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.450 
the new growth is the part that will
grow<00:01:29.030> alright<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:31.009> what<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.430> is

what<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.240> honey<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:38.250> use

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
what this here is honey so I don't use

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
what this here is honey so I don't use
rooting<00:01:38.939> hormone<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.630> particularly

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
rooting hormone I don't particularly

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.679 
rooting hormone I don't particularly
like<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.700> because<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.820> chemical<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like it because it's chemical I like to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.060 
like it because it's chemical I like to
do<00:01:42.810> things<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.200> bit<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.409> natural<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
do things a little bit more natural and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.410 
do things a little bit more natural and
honey's<00:01:44.579> supposed<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.360> for

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
honey's supposed to be a good thing for

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
honey's supposed to be a good thing for
it<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> cut<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.610> nice

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it so what we want to do is cut a nice

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.260 
it so what we want to do is cut a nice
angle<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.979> cutting<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.090> does

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
angle on the cutting and what that does

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.870 
angle on the cutting and what that does
that<00:01:51.299> maximizes<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> openings<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that maximizes the openings in the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.889 
that maximizes the openings in the
capillaries<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> UM<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> chute<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.600> we

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
capillaries of the UM of the chute so we

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
capillaries of the UM of the chute so we
dip<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> honey<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.250> good<00:01:59.460> stir

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
dip that in the honey can we good stir

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.499 
dip that in the honey can we good stir
around

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.550 

let<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> excess<00:02:03.960> come<00:02:04.259> off<00:02:06.380> okay

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
let the excess come off okay

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
let the excess come off okay
and<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:08.130> put<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> water<00:02:09.739> get<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:10.830> of

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
and we put that in the water get out of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.000 
and we put that in the water get out of
that<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.540> yeah<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.810> water<00:02:13.050> shouldn't

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
that actually yeah the water shouldn't

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.360 
that actually yeah the water shouldn't
go<00:02:14.160> any<00:02:14.459> higher<00:02:15.290> than<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> old<00:02:16.680> would<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
go any higher than the old would so the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
go any higher than the old would so the
new<00:02:17.550> green<00:02:17.910> stuff<00:02:18.300> should<00:02:19.019> be<00:02:19.200> outside<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
new green stuff should be outside of the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:37.309 
new green stuff should be outside of the
water<00:02:33.739> now<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:36.690> could<00:02:36.810> probably<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.170> in

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
water now you could probably do it in

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.840 
water now you could probably do it in
soil<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.799> well<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> soil<00:02:40.580> can't<00:02:41.580> quite

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
soil as well but in the soil can't quite

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.240 
soil as well but in the soil can't quite
see<00:02:42.150> when<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> Reds<00:02:43.410> are<00:02:43.530> coming<00:02:43.560> out<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.040> want
