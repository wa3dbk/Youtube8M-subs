00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.910 

okay<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.260> first<00:01:32.380> thing<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.650> want<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.800> do

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
okay so the first thing you want to do

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.560 
okay so the first thing you want to do
is<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.190> want<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.430> start<00:01:33.940> with<00:01:34.000> your<00:01:34.120> sugar<00:01:34.330> and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
is you want to start with your sugar and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.290 
is you want to start with your sugar and
just<00:01:34.840> put<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.050> few<00:01:35.350> spoonfuls<00:01:35.710> into<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> top<00:01:37.000> so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
just put a few spoonfuls into the top so

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.940 
just put a few spoonfuls into the top so
I'm<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.540> going<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.720> probably<00:01:38.140> half<00:01:38.410> fill<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
I'm just going to probably half fill the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.700 
I'm just going to probably half fill the
top<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.750> whatever<00:01:40.990> kind<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.260> size<00:01:41.410> will<00:01:41.620> be

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
top so whatever kind of size will be

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.640 
top so whatever kind of size will be
half<00:01:41.860> half<00:01:42.220> fill<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.640> with<00:01:42.880> your<00:01:43.450> sugar<00:01:43.690> next

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
half half fill it with your sugar next

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.110 
half half fill it with your sugar next
you're<00:01:44.860> gonna<00:01:44.950> move<00:01:45.100> on<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.280> your<00:01:45.550> baby<00:01:45.850> oil

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
you're gonna move on to your baby oil

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.680 
you're gonna move on to your baby oil
and<00:01:48.240> you're<00:01:49.240> gonna<00:01:49.510> just<00:01:49.870> I<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:53.290> say<00:01:54.690> just

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
and you're gonna just I would say just

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.460 
and you're gonna just I would say just
keep<00:01:55.900> squeezing<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:57.360> I'd<00:01:58.360> say<00:01:58.660> put<00:01:58.900> about<00:01:59.200> a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
keep squeezing it in I'd say put about a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.980 
keep squeezing it in I'd say put about a
quarter<00:01:59.740> of<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.280> amount<00:02:00.370> of<00:02:00.760> baby<00:02:01.210> oil<00:02:01.330> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
quarter of the amount of baby oil that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.730 
quarter of the amount of baby oil that
you've<00:02:02.110> put<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.530> sugar<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:05.140> kind<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.560> if

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
you've put in sugar if you kind of if

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.950 
you've put in sugar if you kind of if
you<00:02:05.770> understand<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:07.240> just<00:02:07.360> want<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.570> mix<00:02:07.720> it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
you understand we just want to mix it

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.889 
you understand we just want to mix it
and<00:02:08.950> keep<00:02:09.160> stirring<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.700> I'd<00:02:10.330> probably<00:02:10.390> put<00:02:10.869> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
and keep stirring it I'd probably put a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.930 
and keep stirring it I'd probably put a
little<00:02:11.140> bit<00:02:11.290> too<00:02:11.440> much<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.800> there<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.700> want<00:02:15.850> it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
little bit too much in there you want it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.410 
little bit too much in there you want it
to<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> consistency<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.530> dry<00:02:18.370> ice<00:02:18.420> so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
to be the consistency of like dry ice so

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.750 
to be the consistency of like dry ice so
on<00:02:19.540> add<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> bit<00:02:19.959> more<00:02:19.990> sugar

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.890 

dry<00:02:24.760> ice<00:02:25.000> would<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> perfect<00:02:25.540> consistency

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
dry ice would be the perfect consistency

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.930 
dry ice would be the perfect consistency
for<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> as<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.459> see<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.760> it's

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
for this so as you can see that it's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.080 
for this so as you can see that it's
still<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.150> little<00:02:31.330> bit<00:02:31.570> wet<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:33.760> keep<00:02:33.910> adding

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
still a little bit wet just keep adding

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.490 
still a little bit wet just keep adding
sugar<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.940> basically<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.600> trial<00:02:38.320> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
sugar it's basically like a trial and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.720 
sugar it's basically like a trial and
error<00:02:38.680> type<00:02:38.860> thing<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> if<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.370> get<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.580> wrong

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
error type thing so if you get it wrong

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.140 
error type thing so if you get it wrong
just<00:02:43.090> add<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> little<00:02:43.540> bit<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:44.040> sugar<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.910> if

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
just add a little bit of sugar if it if

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.449 
just add a little bit of sugar if it if
it's<00:02:46.330> too<00:02:46.420> dry<00:02:46.780> add<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.200> little<00:02:47.410> bit<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.680> oil<00:02:48.100> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
it's too dry add a little bit of oil and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.770 
it's too dry add a little bit of oil and
if<00:02:48.519> it's<00:02:48.640> too<00:02:48.820> wet<00:02:49.060> add<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.330> little<00:02:49.570> bit<00:02:49.750> of

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
if it's too wet add a little bit of

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.970 
if it's too wet add a little bit of
sugar<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.370> eventually<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.519> will<00:02:52.680> turns<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
sugar and eventually it will turns the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.100 
sugar and eventually it will turns the
way<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.180> perfect<00:02:55.720> if

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
way you like it so that it's perfect if

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.970 
way you like it so that it's perfect if
you<00:02:56.590> can<00:02:56.830> see<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.140> absolutely<00:02:59.320> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
you can see that that is absolutely the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.300 
you can see that that is absolutely the
consistency<00:03:00.760> we're<00:03:00.910> looking<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:03.100> now

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
consistency we're looking for so now

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.810 
consistency we're looking for so now
it's<00:03:03.519> time<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.760> add<00:03:04.000> your<00:03:05.010> scent<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:06.760> you

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
it's time to add your scent now you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.600 
it's time to add your scent now you
could<00:03:07.090> use<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.420> like<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.720> by<00:03:08.019> all<00:03:08.170> means<00:03:08.610> but

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
could use it like that by all means but

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.680 
could use it like that by all means but
I<00:03:09.910> like<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.299> add<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:11.459> scent<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.700> I'm<00:03:13.269> gonna<00:03:13.540> be

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
I like to add a scent so I'm gonna be

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.710 
I like to add a scent so I'm gonna be
using<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.140> warm<00:03:15.010> vanilla<00:03:15.100> sugar<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.570> I'm<00:03:19.630> just

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
using the warm vanilla sugar so I'm just

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.910 
using the warm vanilla sugar so I'm just
going<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> squeeze<00:03:20.110> not<00:03:20.410> too<00:03:20.560> much<00:03:20.739> because

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
going to squeeze not too much because

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.009 
going to squeeze not too much because
you<00:03:21.070> know<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.340> too<00:03:21.459> watery<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.840> I'm<00:03:22.930> just

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
you know it's too watery but I'm just

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:31.460 
you know it's too watery but I'm just
gonna<00:03:23.170> squeeze<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:24.100> little<00:03:24.970> bit<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.660> top

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.979 

so<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.890> should<00:03:33.099> be<00:03:33.340> enough<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.690> give

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so that should be enough and just give

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:48.600 
so that should be enough and just give
that<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> stir<00:03:38.349> into<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:47.069> okay<00:03:48.069> so<00:03:48.129> once<00:03:48.400> that's

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
that a stir into it okay so once that's

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.530 
that a stir into it okay so once that's
all<00:03:48.940> stirred<00:03:49.329> in<00:03:49.540> you're<00:03:50.440> done<00:03:50.670> how<00:03:51.670> simple<00:03:52.329> is

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
all stirred in you're done how simple is

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.750 
all stirred in you're done how simple is
that

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.819 

you
