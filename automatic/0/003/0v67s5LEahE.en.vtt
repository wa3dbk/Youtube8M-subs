00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.940
 We use enough on the day we 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.310
 will do for example could you then 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.850

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.590
 caramelized for embossing example 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.619
 caused cause you want where 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.929
 need to use the route to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 without further ado we will start 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.230
 reflect 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.730
 Good guys, so I'll start what to do. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 Calm down, I have here a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.379
 I'm going to call the fire here. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 low fire, it's very low for us 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.160
 starting then I got here I already 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 I have this separate way of remembering that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 I'll leave it below in the description of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:01:03.410
 video so let's get going I go 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:03.410
 add my sugar here to my water 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.590
 I'm going to mix it up, okay, so here it is. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 so look I'll leave it on fire now 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.880
 Okay, okay, I'll let the fire have 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.080
 at that caramel point 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.909
 I'll be back to show you soon. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100
 You how it must be staying then? 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.020

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 [Music] 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.439
 Look, you can start to notice that she is. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.119
 start to get dark 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.520
 When I got to this point, it's not 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.009
 You stop fucking her because she 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.409
 do not be careful who she is fast 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.579
 Then it started to stay like this. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.820
 to move 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:45.640
 I'll soon turn off the fire 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:47.770
 [Music] 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.130
 So now it's like this, I could see that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.690
 she was very dark, look, see. 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.479
 This way I'm here at this point. 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.180

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.200

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.060

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.900

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.110
 She started to stay. She's already at the point. 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.120
