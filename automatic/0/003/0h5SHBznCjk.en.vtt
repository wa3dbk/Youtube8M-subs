00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.159
 yeah 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.760
 Yes 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.970
 Why 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.349
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.540
 new episode gone in league one episode 6 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.040
 0 and we had four games because 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.290
 pretty little happened that's that 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.710
 by the way last game in the yes, yes 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.660
 red 3 if we win or too 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.110
 we are only one point to pick 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.880
 master 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.649
 and as you can see it is here 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.440
 sixtieth minute already played out 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:51.130
 often pass mesut ozil and the pipeline to 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:52.660
 1 0 for us relatively fast and it is 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 By the way, that was it too 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.530
 we win that means we are 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.210
 league champion in league three and yes from 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.070
 Now it was still the old team off 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.659
 Now I'm playing with the new theme 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.390
 sat in the second league plays with 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.040
 The new team I was yesterday in the squad 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.600
 pictures have presented who the video 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 have not seen you look the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
 description and no longer wrap up 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.930
 that was it a game i had a thousand 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.720
 chance makes no and gibson construction line 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.159
 eleven meters for him then of course you 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.950
 By the way, now already the second 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.860
 league as I said and unfortunately I have to be 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.780
 team not in the box so to say that 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.150
 happened to me twice on this episode 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.540
 that I forgot to record on 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.250
 beginning and that's why I now have a 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 pretty much was in the Bundesliga team with 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.299
 a little english player not like that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 doll and it shoots me the elfmeter 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.970
 because cashiers here holds the ball wonderful 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.049
 then with 82 minutes were still the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.990
 better team were really 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.970
 constantly actually front and hummels 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 then took on thiago silva thiago silva 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.330
 then the pass schweinsteiger show too 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.110
 a pass on sven bender bender and 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.840
 then 104 rings after ten minutes 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.000
 yes that was really wanted to play there 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.790
 but well that happens, there are always 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 how was that, of course, there is one 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.030
 real football world so i want myself 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.529
 Do not complain because I had to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.810
 example against internet tim meadow the 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.420
 against the greeks 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.489
 the kings greek team there as well 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.790
 So good luck we lose since it 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.989
 10 and that's the first defeat 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.489
 and now with the new team 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.319
 that's of course bitter zero points and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.620
 nine games time by 17 points 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.569
 retract 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.819
 maybe we do not protect but yes well 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.390
 give our best then we have let 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.010
 yes , our opponent 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.280
 april is not for him now 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.250
 had not seen david yet 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.350
 luiz as always among each other as in the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:04.470
 storm and in midfield I opponents 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.510
 did not like it so much but he was 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.870
 Still better than me , I have to admit 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.750
 and agÃ¼ero pushes a 47 the note one 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.310
 to zero for us , of course, looked the same 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 really good I have, of course 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.489
 definitely needed these three points 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.600
 Let's see if he can get you 82 minute 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.060
 Robben Aguero Pass Rooney lets him 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.150
 sent by shot with left 20 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.840
 the decision in the 83 minute 2 0 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.880
 for us 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.160
 that means the first three points you 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.680
 you are but then retracted by 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.390
 initial difficulties in this 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.140
 league and yes that was s 2 0 against that 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.900
 You have to say that you are relatively undeserved 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.230
 but nothing good 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.220
 we have the last game for that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.260
 By the way, the temple gave 2 2 1 against there 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.709
 was to float around the tent and earned 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.709
 lose lost like him and now 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.880
 win we deserve here so 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.069
 play three points after two 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.010
 the 17 points are definitely too 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.989
 possible and is our third opponent me 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.150
 unfortunately forgot here as I said 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.040
 to record his team 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.230
 baker the 1200 kilo off 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.070
 colombia and right he had roja that 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.010
 means he thinks that the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.880
 Mexican League David goal was in the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.910
 73 minute to 0 74 story to 0 2 1 for 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.910
 us 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.010
 Of course that's always good 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.510
 and yes people will even be there today 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.810
 By the way, give a second video 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.889
 from me and indeed would like an announcement 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.480
 about a little christmas 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.530
 specials I 've got something planned 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.050
 it will tell you everything later 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.510
 david room makes 90210 always first 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.650
 for a short video to come back to it 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.460
 that will be present 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.419
 I think at the latest 9 to 10 o'clock 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.500
 his rage 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.550
 But I think earlier at 9 o'clock because then 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.979
 I'll go then I'm not there anymore 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.580
 the home then and then yes ninetieth 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.060
 minute owed eleven meters for the 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.919
 opponent 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.840
 is there now ramirez will be 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.180
 He pours water in casillas 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.690
 no chance 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.690
 Casillas without a chance 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.700
 Now, of course, the question we can 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.590
 still hold that 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.580
 he cheered exuberantly what do we know 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.350
 on us we win the game here 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.580
 two to individual next three 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.580
 points with six at the number 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.960
 and yes cashes selling looks bad 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.370
 So here we win as I said 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.140
 though with six points 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.580
 I hope you are back in Paris where 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.480
 it is always good as it is said that's it 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.480
 video and her
