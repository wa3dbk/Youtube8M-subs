end<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:52.879> fight<00:00:53.180> wasn't<00:00:53.719> as<00:00:53.809> result<00:00:54.260> of

end to this fight wasn't as result of
any<00:00:54.649> of<00:00:54.800> lychees<00:00:55.309> abilities<00:00:55.879> because<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:56.510> is

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
any of lychees abilities because this is

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.959 
any of lychees abilities because this is
a<00:00:56.690> very<00:00:56.899> basic<00:00:57.110> fight<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.370> was<00:00:58.550> because

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
a very basic fight it was because

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.270 
a very basic fight it was because
unfortunately<00:00:59.180> at<00:00:59.960> one<00:01:00.289> segment<00:01:00.860> during<00:01:01.070> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
unfortunately at one segment during the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.090 
unfortunately at one segment during the
fight<00:01:01.519> and<00:01:01.850> we<00:01:02.180> did<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:02.479> few<00:01:02.570> times<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.680> kept

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
fight and we did it a few times it kept

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.399 
fight and we did it a few times it kept
crashing<00:01:04.640> out<00:01:04.820> half<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.899> raid<00:01:06.110> and

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
crashing out half of the raid and

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.190 
crashing out half of the raid and
literally<00:01:06.770> critical<00:01:07.700> error<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.570> we<00:01:08.600> had<00:01:08.960> to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
literally critical error so we had to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.260 
literally critical error so we had to
reconnect<00:01:09.950> get<00:01:10.310> back<00:01:10.490> into<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.850> fight<00:01:11.060> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
reconnect get back into the fight and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.510 
reconnect get back into the fight and
proved<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:12.020> be<00:01:12.049> very<00:01:12.380> very<00:01:12.649> chaotic<00:01:12.950> indeed

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
proved to be very very chaotic indeed

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.550 
proved to be very very chaotic indeed
but<00:01:14.090> as<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:14.659> said<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.049> fight<00:01:15.259> isn't

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
but as I just said this fight isn't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.200 
but as I just said this fight isn't
particularly<00:01:16.100> difficult<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.820> there's<00:01:16.970> just

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
particularly difficult and there's just

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.660 
particularly difficult and there's just
a<00:01:17.360> very<00:01:17.539> few<00:01:18.110> mechanics<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.399> probably

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
a very few mechanics so it probably

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.399 
a very few mechanics so it probably
needs<00:01:19.850> tuning<00:01:20.149> up<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.690> first<00:01:20.960> one<00:01:21.170> here

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
needs tuning up now the first one here

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.649 
needs tuning up now the first one here
is<00:01:21.590> protect<00:01:22.460> where<00:01:22.700> she<00:01:22.820> puts<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.149> immunity

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
is protect where she puts in immunity

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.490 
is protect where she puts in immunity
around<00:01:23.780> herself

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
around herself

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.010 
around herself
summons<00:01:25.250> three<00:01:25.550> ads<00:01:25.700> into<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.090> fight<00:01:26.330> all<00:01:26.840> you

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
summons three ads into the fight all you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.749 
summons three ads into the fight all you
have<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.350> do<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.560> kill<00:01:27.800> one<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.369> ads<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
have to do is kill one of the ads the

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.999 
have to do is kill one of the ads the
other<00:01:28.789> two<00:01:29.090> would<00:01:29.179> disappear<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.710> will

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
other two would disappear and so will

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.399 
other two would disappear and so will
her<00:01:31.190> immunity<00:01:31.550> bubble<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.360> now<00:01:32.960> she's<00:01:33.259> doing

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
her immunity bubble and now she's doing

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.320 
her immunity bubble and now she's doing
the<00:01:33.560> ability<00:01:33.920> called<00:01:34.130> hide<00:01:34.520> where<00:01:35.000> she<00:01:35.179> will

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
the ability called hide where she will

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.139 
the ability called hide where she will
vanish<00:01:35.630> from<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.590> fight<00:01:36.830> itself<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.759> the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
vanish from the fight itself and the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.749 
vanish from the fight itself and the
only<00:01:38.270> way<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.539> bring<00:01:38.899> her<00:01:39.110> back<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:40.069> by<00:01:40.429> hitting

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
only way to bring her back is by hitting

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.139 
only way to bring her back is by hitting
her<00:01:41.090> with<00:01:41.300> AoE<00:01:42.259> abilities<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.670> when<00:01:43.880> he<00:01:43.970> hit

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
her with AoE abilities and when he hit

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.419 
her with AoE abilities and when he hit
her<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.299> certain<00:01:44.659> amount<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:45.110> times<00:01:45.440> then<00:01:46.130> she

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
her a certain amount of times then she

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.789 
her a certain amount of times then she
will<00:01:46.610> rejoin<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.330> fight<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.319> can<00:01:48.530> start

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
has called afraid where every % that you

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.960 
has called afraid where every % that you
take<00:02:42.650> off<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> maximum<00:02:43.580> health

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
take off a maximum health

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.600 
take off a maximum health
she<00:02:44.420> will<00:02:44.510> increase<00:02:44.870> her<00:02:45.019> casting<00:02:45.590> speed<00:02:45.980> by

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
she will increase her casting speed by

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.990 
she will increase her casting speed by
1%<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.989> main<00:02:48.230> ability<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.129> called<00:02:49.489> spray

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
1% but the main ability is called spray

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.430 
1% but the main ability is called spray
which<00:02:50.330> does<00:02:50.569> 60<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.680> 130k<00:02:52.670> damage<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.930> everyone

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
which does 60 to 130k damage to everyone

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.530 
which does 60 to 130k damage to everyone
within<00:02:54.620> two<00:02:54.920> point<00:02:55.250> five<00:02:55.430> yards<00:02:55.850> range<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.390> we

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
within two point five yards range so we

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.780 
within two point five yards range so we
held<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.960> melee<00:02:57.260> slightly<00:02:58.100> further<00:02:58.280> back<00:02:58.460> and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
held the melee slightly further back and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.950 
held the melee slightly further back and
the<00:02:59.030> off<00:02:59.180> tank

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
the off tank

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.720 
the off tank
and<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.320> also<00:03:00.530> increases<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.190> frost<00:03:01.520> damage

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
and it also increases the frost damage

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.990 
and it also increases the frost damage
you<00:03:01.970> take<00:03:02.000> by<00:03:02.330> 10%<00:03:03.110> for<00:03:03.290> 10<00:03:03.860> seconds<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.640> it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
you take by 10% for 10 seconds and it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.510 
you take by 10% for 10 seconds and it
stacks<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.380> you've<00:03:06.560> got<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:07.010> very<00:03:07.190> careful

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
stacks so you've got to be very careful

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.390 
stacks so you've got to be very careful
tanks<00:03:08.180> how<00:03:08.480> many<00:03:08.690> steps<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.290> take<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.800> when

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
tanks how many steps you take and when

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000 
tanks how many steps you take and when
you<00:03:10.580> decide<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.360> rotate<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.350> rough<00:03:12.620> tank

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
you decide to rotate with a rough tank

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.400 
you decide to rotate with a rough tank
and<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.670> course<00:03:13.700> let<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.900> ability

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and then of course let that ability

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.200 
and then of course let that ability
dissipate<00:03:16.040> from<00:03:16.430> yourself<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:16.940> that's<00:03:17.060> what

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
dissipate from yourself and that's what

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.300 
dissipate from yourself and that's what
ended<00:03:17.540> up<00:03:17.660> killing<00:03:18.410> our<00:03:18.560> maintain<00:03:19.070> because

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
ended up killing our maintain because

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.310 
ended up killing our maintain because
our<00:03:19.430> off<00:03:19.610> tank<00:03:19.820> still<00:03:20.180> hadn't<00:03:20.540> managed<00:03:20.840> to

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
our off tank still hadn't managed to

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.190 
our off tank still hadn't managed to
reconnect<00:03:21.950> from<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.580> actual<00:03:23.000> crash<00:03:23.690> itself

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
reconnect from the actual crash itself

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.590 
reconnect from the actual crash itself
and<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.890> is<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.220> ability<00:03:25.820> wise<00:03:26.000> that's<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.450> so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
and that is it ability wise that's it so

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.240 
and that is it ability wise that's it so
I<00:03:26.660> think<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.990> lot<00:03:27.200> more<00:03:27.440> got<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:27.770> be<00:03:27.920> added<00:03:28.160> to
