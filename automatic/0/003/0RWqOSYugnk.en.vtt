00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.940
 my name is julieta silvestre powell 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.490
 I am a student of the faculty of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.230
 physical education specifically from the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 let alone teaching career 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 physical education 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.260
 Since this race from 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.360
 conduct an orientation course 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.790
 vocational they called my attention 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.050
 many careers linked some 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.050
 ways with health 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.840
 I think I chose this one because I had had 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.430
 the possibility of seeing how they work 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.140
 works in the environment in which 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.230
 the professionals in 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.360
 physical education 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 and I am also struck by the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.070
 social interaction let's say that one has 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.079
 of places of this profession with the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 people 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.609
 and also good obviously make 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.359
 some sports I was in a kind of 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.190
 experiences related to that and I think 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.339
 that there I became aware or I could see 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.409
 feel like as of influence in one 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.960
 how it influences one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.969
 the practice of physical activity both 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.140
 in the corporal increasing the performance 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:16.380
 for daily chores as well 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.829
 emotionally in the psychological now 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.619
 with a little more experience I think that 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.569
 also take into account from the point 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.229
 of teaching view specifically 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:31.170
 the return that students make us 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.619
 the love and the see also that what 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.719
 one teaches has its fruits see how 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.799
 transfers each student depending on his 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:44.310
 life and I think that also now so 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.040
 less reaffirms my decision the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.810
 expectations that one has 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 when deciding to study this career I think 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.760
 that depends a lot on the people of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.080
 moment that is not found maybe 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.200
 out there at first one says good 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.230
 it's four years in four years I'm 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.910
 received after the income arrives he sees it 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.830
 difficult has you also from the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.170
 moment I'm in but I think what 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.250
 true it would be that one has to go 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.370
 knowing and learning with the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.590
 time to how to lead the career 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.500
 there's no one way to do it and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.120
 depends a lot on the needs of the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.409
 possibilities that one has in me 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.110
 material experience that was very 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.819
 nice a very nice experience 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.299
 one goes starts to spend a lot of time in 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.890
 the faculty that's good because it's going 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.180
 adapting to what is the course of the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.069
 career and something very good special in 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.720
 our career and the interaction there 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.420
 among the students there is a lot of 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.860
 interaction between us and some of 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.140
 the most significant experiences for 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.519
 me the one taken is that from the first 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.019
 year 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.840
 we are given the possibility gives us the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.780
 Possibility to position ourselves in our 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.269
 future role that we also participate in 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.129
 different activities like tournaments 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.890
 sports with a solid of the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.010
 recreational days and we work in 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.860
 caps in squares 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.049
 I think that's very good because maybe 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.400
 out there in some race one arrives 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.959
 halfway through the freshly 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.939
 really have the experience of what 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.140
 is going to be his profession in the future I had 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.520
 work experiences during the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.460
 taken 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.400
 Last year part of the team 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.490
 work of the chair of gymnastics 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.460
 female in introduction level and this 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.680
 year I also do it but in another one in another 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.600
 Chair in the first swimming 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.940
 introduction also in our career 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.250
 in their curriculum has 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.830
 matters that refer to 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.650
 different areas of knowledge is not 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.630
 just sport with a lot of us 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.220
 we have thought at first 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.380
 they have both theoretical subjects 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.280
 practices we have subjects like anatomy 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.170
 physiology anthropology psychology is 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.180
 important also that the futures 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.150
 students take it into account and to 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.280
 future entrants would recommend them if 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.850
 are not yet decided by the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.730
 race itself for a career in general 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.819
 and take an orientation course 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.090
 vocational 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.789
 I would also recommend that you try not 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.160
 to be influenced to influence the 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.169
 decision by his family for the 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.300
 comments they can make they are 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.590
 friends that kind of thing because in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.449
 definitive that the one who goes the one who does 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.960
 the one who studies the one who later on in his 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.449
 moment you are going to live from this is yourself 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.610
 I would also recommend that you see if 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.650
 they really like teaching because 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.289
 although we from this one of this 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.389
 profession we have many areas or many 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.099
 possibilities of always working 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.849
 somehow or other we are teaching 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.410
 our faculty is like less 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.169
 structured that here in some other 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.789
 that there is a lot of interaction between 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.830
 the teachers and the students then 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.449
 among the students themselves they also 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.880
 I would recommend that you approach the 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.650
 faculty that they know that they see how it is 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.280
 the one studied as the movement that there is in 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.520
 the faculty and if they have close family or 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.910
 Some acquaintance that is professional in 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.370
 this topic that charlene that they speak to him 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.370
 ask, would you recommend that too?
