00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.999
 since then we are standing 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.110
 welcome on Saturday as well as Sunday 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.110
 the qualification day 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.539
 the parts under pressure 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.060
 during the fastest lap 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.060

 the station

 thought the car 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.129
 that is the idea that the top ten enjoys being seated 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.209
 not doing it we want to be in the air first 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.229
 a bit upset little that encourages but disappointed that 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.229
 pushing us through the throat 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:57.990
 Unfortunately not 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.949
 his resignation in the first round 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.919
 the other world star 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.309
 cozy 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.199
