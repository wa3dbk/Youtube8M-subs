00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.100 

same<00:00:49.210> color<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:50.470> was<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:52.000> four<00:00:52.960> times

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
same color and that was like four times

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.510 
same color and that was like four times
more<00:00:53.380> expensive<00:00:53.530> than<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.640> Krylon<00:00:55.000> stuff<00:00:55.480> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
more expensive than the Krylon stuff so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.240 
more expensive than the Krylon stuff so
after<00:00:57.520> that<00:00:57.640> I<00:00:57.700> went<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.180> Kmart<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.990> Kmart<00:00:59.980> had

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
after that I went to Kmart and Kmart had

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.500

this<00:01:00.460> rust-oleum<00:01:00.910> metallic<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
this rust-oleum metallic and that

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
this rust-oleum metallic and that
actually<00:01:05.050> worked<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:06.040> can<00:01:06.160> see<00:01:06.400> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
actually worked you can see the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.450 
actually worked you can see the
difference<00:01:07.750> there's<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.250> there's<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
difference there's the there's the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.890 
difference there's the there's the
Krylon<00:01:09.729> right<00:01:10.060> here<00:01:10.240> that's<00:01:10.420> like<00:01:10.540> brown<00:01:10.870> and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
Krylon right here that's like brown and

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.050 
Krylon right here that's like brown and
then<00:01:11.229> there's<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.740> rest<00:01:12.580> Oh<00:01:12.729> Liam<00:01:12.940> it

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
then there's that rest Oh Liam it

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.530 
then there's that rest Oh Liam it
actually<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.510> a<00:01:13.540> gold<00:01:13.900> color<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.420> do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
actually is a gold color and just to do

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.930 
actually is a gold color and just to do
a<00:01:16.570> comparison<00:01:17.350> how<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.190> compares<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.700> real

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
a comparison how it compares to the real

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.719 
a comparison how it compares to the real
thing<00:01:19.240> for<00:01:20.170> some<00:01:20.410> gold<00:01:21.009> leaf<00:01:23.460> lay<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.670> on

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
thing for some gold leaf lay that on

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:47.359 
thing for some gold leaf lay that on
there<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.690> sloppy<00:01:41.020> but<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:42.399> idea<00:01:42.729> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.779 

it's<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.490> lot<00:01:48.729> closer<00:01:50.429> that's<00:01:51.429> like<00:01:51.640> the
