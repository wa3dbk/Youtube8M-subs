00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
as you can see the order in which you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.180 
as you can see the order in which you
kill<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.810> targets<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.500> how<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.740> accomplish

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
because there's a gameplay variance for

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.580 
because there's a gameplay variance for
handgun<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.920> assault<00:02:01.490> rifle<00:02:01.790> missions
