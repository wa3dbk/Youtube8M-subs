okay so today we're gonna start learning
something<00:00:53.610> called<00:00:54.000> motion<00:00:54.500> using<00:00:55.500> keyframes

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
something called motion using keyframes

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
something called motion using keyframes
so<00:00:58.010> go<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> beginning<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.609> clip<00:01:00.469> zero

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
a keyframe and a keyframe just tell the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
a keyframe and a keyframe just tell the
programs<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.330> point<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.750> time

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I'm gonna take this last keyframe here

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.590 
I'm gonna take this last keyframe here
it's<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.100> three<00:02:11.340> seconds<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.940> drag<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.920 
over the image so what we're gonna do
today<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.760> we're<00:02:38.090> gonna<00:02:38.240> learn<00:02:38.420> how<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.690> do

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
today is we're gonna learn how to do

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.430 
today is we're gonna learn how to do
some<00:02:39.140> masking<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.690> how<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:41.900> some<00:02:42.080> messin

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
some masking and how to do some messin

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.860 
some masking and how to do some messin
we're<00:02:42.590> gonna<00:02:42.710> first<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:44.240> gonna<00:02:44.300> duplicate

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
we're gonna first we're gonna duplicate

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.070 
we're gonna first we're gonna duplicate
the<00:02:45.230> background<00:02:45.350> layer<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.450> here<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:47.780> have<00:02:47.900> two

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
the background layer so here we have two

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.440 
the background layer so here we have two
background<00:02:48.470> layer<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:49.250> take<00:02:49.550> one<00:02:49.820> drag<00:02:50.360> it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
background layer and we take one drag it

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.360 
background layer and we take one drag it
on<00:02:50.630> top<00:02:50.930> swifty<00:02:53.709> okay<00:02:54.709> now<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:54.980> shouldn't<00:02:55.100> be

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
on top swifty okay now you shouldn't be

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.780 
on top swifty okay now you shouldn't be
able<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.700> see<00:02:56.000> swifty<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:56.720> uh<00:02:56.750> this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
able to see swifty because uh this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.020 
able to see swifty because uh this
background<00:02:58.790> image<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.480> taking<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.590> whole

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
background image is taking the whole

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
background image is taking the whole
composition<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.040> we're<00:03:04.430> gonna<00:03:04.520> start<00:03:04.760> masking

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
composition so we're gonna start masking

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.140 
composition so we're gonna start masking
first<00:03:06.050> start<00:03:06.680> by<00:03:06.830> renaming<00:03:07.100> your<00:03:07.459> comp<00:03:07.790> or

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
first start by renaming your comp or

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.650 
first start by renaming your comp or
your<00:03:08.630> clip<00:03:08.870> mask<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.740> we're<00:03:10.640> gonna<00:03:10.730> go<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
your clip mask and we're gonna go in the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.610 
your clip mask and we're gonna go in the
mask<00:03:11.870> tool<00:03:13.630> okay<00:03:14.630> what<00:03:15.020> we're<00:03:15.140> gonna<00:03:15.230> do<00:03:15.440> is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
mask tool okay what we're gonna do is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.530 
mask tool okay what we're gonna do is
we're<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:15.920> gonna<00:03:17.350> carefully<00:03:19.180> click<00:03:20.180> all

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
around the thing with our mask tool or

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.839 
around the thing with our mask tool or
pen<00:03:23.090> tool

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
pen tool

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.339
