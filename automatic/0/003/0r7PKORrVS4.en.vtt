00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
files you could use the alphabet up to

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.430 
files you could use the alphabet up to
26<00:04:03.700> letters<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:07.000> anyway<00:04:07.360> I<00:04:07.599> got<00:04:08.020> them<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.319> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
26 letters so anyway I got them in the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.170 
26 letters so anyway I got them in the
machine<00:04:08.830> now<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:12.750> when<00:04:14.580> when<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.730> hit<00:04:15.970> the
