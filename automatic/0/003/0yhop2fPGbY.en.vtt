00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.530 
and beards are nice they blend in this
is<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.500> measuring<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> first<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.970> didn't

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is me measuring the first one I didn't

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.090 
is me measuring the first one I didn't
know<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.530> didn't<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.860> he

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
know this is what I didn't like he

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
know this is what I didn't like he
should<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.360> lemp's<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.899> them

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
should have put the lemp's on them

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810 
should have put the lemp's on them
because<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.520> once

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because I don't really know what it once

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
because I don't really know what it once
was<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.750> had<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> measure<00:02:01.200> them<00:02:01.439> all

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
was what and I had to measure them all

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
was what and I had to measure them all
out<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> first<00:02:02.759> thing<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.030> 16<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
out so the first thing is 16 this one is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.749 
out so the first thing is 16 this one is
17<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.979> mentioned<00:02:08.220> another<00:02:08.520> one

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
17 but I think I mentioned another one

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.230 
17 but I think I mentioned another one
and<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> same<00:02:09.390> exact<00:02:09.630> bun<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.080> got<00:02:10.229> 18<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
and that same exact bun when I got 18 so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.180 
and that same exact bun when I got 18 so
I<00:02:12.240> think<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.080> Grange<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:14.010> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I think they do Grange is but it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070 
I think they do Grange is but it
supposed<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.550> 16<00:02:15.030> 18<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> last

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
supposed to be 16 18 and then the last

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.530 
supposed to be 16 18 and then the last
one<00:02:16.350> measured<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.280> 20<00:02:18.090> which<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.270> this

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
one measured out to be 20 which is this

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.100 
one measured out to be 20 which is this
interesting<00:02:19.110> right<00:02:19.380> now<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.820> me<00:02:24.570> pulling<00:02:24.930> the
