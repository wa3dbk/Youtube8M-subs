00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:14.660
 the example that Peter put before not the 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.839
 character was nothing good yes 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.839
 [Music] 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.670
 [Laughs] 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.689
 [Music] 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.689
 because we live for some little gifts 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 productivity did not see what it put you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.379
 a good night when we are going to see well 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.700
 the note 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.860
 polite 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 so we try to talk as best of the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.150
 day in concubines that were with them 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.970
 they were rehearsing good tell me how 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.740
 you saw them today after a great day 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.090
 we enjoyed a lot we were 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.890
 nervous before but moment that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 He left the door and we entered the two 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.850
 I think it's good to be able to compensate 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 nerves run to another no and now that the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 We had a great time, we did not relax, we did not relax 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 super fun because stress and I 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 I imagine that the relax I was going 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 rewarding with my boyfriend right now but 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 the truth is that the choreo is not what happened to me 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.440
 and if it rarely happened to me that years 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.850
 previous go so nervous that as 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.110
 he said he wanted to remind me of accor and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.729
 at the moment for example now with you 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.170
 I say I want to remember it ran and it was 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.970
 as a blocked moment in my life not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.740
 I remember everything I remember looking at 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.690
 him to be connected but good nothing 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 the things that said curing are true and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.710
 able that we agreed 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.660
 because like you there is a little bit 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.810
 then like he had a little 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.119
 interdict between jury and no I do not go 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 nor the coach I think he jumped to defend his 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.060
 laburo that was a matter of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 choreography but it's good that we 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.100
 demand I thank the jury for telling me 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.780
 I am a dancer but 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.200
 I feel that a contest is coming 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.360
 quite complicated to demand quite 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.890
 but he was always very respectful with 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.540
 Much love the truth that you are sworn 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.009
 as we stay there they tell us those things 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.299
 that fill me with pride that I 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.310
 say I'm a dancer I love 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.899
 but well, nothing will be demanded of me like that 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.350
 I say we are going to have to work on 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.170
 triple 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.549
 sendic and memory for example has as 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.659
 something of you for being such friends of 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.319
 nazarenas saw that you already have a war 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.660
 important as always last year 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.880
 when I started this farewell to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.130
 single always told me divine things 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.989
 that I was super refined that was divine 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.340
 that although they throw a bucket of tuco the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.230
 I never felt the bad vibes of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.510
 she on the contrary we have found 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.650
 in a hotel in charge we told him 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.780
 we have already talked about the pool 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.160
 we have a good relationship it seems that it is 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.300
 an artist who does not tell me things a 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.739
 problem that has a problem with 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.080
 nazarÃ­ in something else are we two 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.790
 they are we are not friends I do not say friends 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.030
 let's see we are friends we are not relatives to 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.370
 that today is not that we have a 1 sep that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.350
 we are his brothers or his children 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.390
 I say we are co-workers nothing is 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.460
 how is like a mom to us today 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 for today she is a great friend but 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.150
 I think things can be divided 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 well finally we can ask that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.190

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.190
