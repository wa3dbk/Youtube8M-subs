jump button as well so you can do jumps

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.430 
jump button as well so you can do jumps
and<00:03:01.760> notice<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.420> little<00:03:02.600> drifts<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:03.350> you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
and notice the little drifts but you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.020 
and notice the little drifts but you
can't<00:03:03.680> do<00:03:03.800> turbos<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.550> drift<00:03:04.790> are<00:03:04.970> in

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
can't do turbos up to the drift are in

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.940 
can't do turbos up to the drift are in
fact<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.450> there's<00:03:06.230> also<00:03:06.380> tons<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.890> different

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
fact that there's also tons of different

fact that there's also tons of different
weapons<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:07.640> things<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.450> Lightning's

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
weapons so things like the Lightning's

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.479 
weapons so things like the Lightning's
which<00:03:09.140> obviously<00:03:09.410> shrink<00:03:09.800> everyone<00:03:10.160> except

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
which obviously shrink everyone except

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.220 
which obviously shrink everyone except
you<00:03:10.670> there's<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:10.970> mushrooms<00:03:11.390> which<00:03:11.660> turbos

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
you there's the mushrooms which turbos

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.930 
you there's the mushrooms which turbos
miss<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.920> red<00:03:13.100> shells<00:03:13.370> which<00:03:13.550> form<00:03:13.760> on

miss the red shells which form on

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.340 
miss the red shells which form on
there's<00:03:14.269> just<00:03:14.330> stuff<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.200> like

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
there's just stuff like that it's like

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.350 
there's just stuff like that it's like
any<00:03:15.560> other<00:03:15.650> Mario<00:03:16.040> Kart<00:03:16.280> game<00:03:16.459> really<00:03:16.820> but

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
any other Mario Kart game really but

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640 
any other Mario Kart game really but
personally<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.870> think<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.200> one<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> best

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
personally I think it's one of the best

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.710 
personally I think it's one of the best
ones<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:18.890> have<00:03:19.040> ever<00:03:19.130> done<00:03:19.420> I'd<00:03:20.420> probably

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
ones that have ever done I'd probably

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.210 
ones that have ever done I'd probably
say<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.200> possibly<00:03:21.530> me<00:03:21.680> fear<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.070> just

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
say this possibly me fear of it just

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.430 
say this possibly me fear of it just
simply<00:03:22.580> because<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.720> first<00:03:23.959> one<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.350> I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
simply because it's the first one and I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.810 
simply because it's the first one and I
liked<00:03:24.620> everything<00:03:24.920> done<00:03:25.250> about<00:03:25.459> which<00:03:25.640> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
liked everything done about which and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.729 
liked everything done about which and
since<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:26.269> have<00:03:26.600> made<00:03:27.320> some<00:03:27.560> good

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
since then have made some good

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.290 
since then have made some good
improvements<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.459> series<00:03:28.820> but<00:03:29.030> have<00:03:29.150> also

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
improvements to the series but have also

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.699 
improvements to the series but have also
got<00:03:29.630> rid<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.900> few<00:03:30.080> things<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.500> liked

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
got rid of a few things that I liked

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.920 
got rid of a few things that I liked
about<00:03:30.800> it<00:03:31.070> but<00:03:31.910> anyway<00:03:32.209> I'm<00:03:32.480> not<00:03:32.510> gonna<00:03:32.750> go

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
about it but anyway I'm not gonna go

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.449 
about it but anyway I'm not gonna go
into<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.200> air<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.530> play<00:03:33.769> screen<00:03:34.130> because

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
into the air to play screen because

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.820 
into the air to play screen because
there's<00:03:34.610> other<00:03:34.700> things<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.060> can<00:03:35.209> do<00:03:35.300> on<00:03:35.390> it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
there's other things you can do on it

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.860 
there's other things you can do on it
and<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.760> actually<00:03:36.940> means<00:03:37.210> at<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.450> bottom<00:03:37.720> half

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
and it actually means at the bottom half

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.630 
and it actually means at the bottom half
of<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.020> TV<00:03:38.350> screens<00:03:38.650> actually<00:03:39.010> useful<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
of the TV screens actually useful for a

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:48.900 
of the TV screens actually useful for a
change<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.830> we<00:03:47.980> call<00:03:48.160> on<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.520> two-player

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
change so we call on the two-player

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.090 
change so we call on the two-player
screen<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.540> consider<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.080> GP<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.950> it's

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
screen you consider the GP so it's

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.770 
screen you consider the GP so it's
basically<00:03:51.340> YouTube<00:03:51.760> taking<00:03:52.120> on<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.240> computer

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
basically YouTube taking on the computer

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.540 
basically YouTube taking on the computer
or<00:03:53.020> you<00:03:53.110> can<00:03:53.200> have<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.380> single<00:03:53.680> Mariusz<00:03:54.310> which

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
or you can have a single Mariusz which

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.710 
or you can have a single Mariusz which
is<00:03:54.670> obviously<00:03:54.940> just<00:03:55.030> choose<00:03:55.390> one<00:03:55.570> of<00:03:55.600> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
is obviously just choose one of the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.750 
is obviously just choose one of the
tracks<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.140> then<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.350> via<00:03:56.500> stats<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.160> I

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
tracks and then you via stats and I

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.550 
tracks and then you via stats and I
believe<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.450> computer<00:03:58.840> run<00:03:58.960> on<00:03:59.140> this<00:03:59.290> but

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
believe the computer run on this but

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.780 
believe the computer run on this but
I'll<00:03:59.650> just<00:03:59.680> double<00:04:00.070> check<00:04:00.250> by<00:04:00.430> actually

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
I'll just double check by actually

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.100 
I'll just double check by actually
putting<00:04:00.940> your<00:04:01.270> honor<00:04:01.420> might<00:04:01.630> as<00:04:01.720> well<00:04:01.870> because

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
putting your honor might as well because

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.930 
putting your honor might as well because
we've<00:04:02.260> got<00:04:02.380> enough<00:04:02.560> time<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:03.490> 10-minute

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
we've got enough time the 10-minute

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.460 
we've got enough time the 10-minute
limit<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.420> actually<00:04:04.840> more<00:04:04.960> than<00:04:05.080> enough<00:04:05.290> this

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
limit is actually more than enough this

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.730 
limit is actually more than enough this
time

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
time

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.040 
time
so<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.970> go<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.240> just<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.900> choose

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
so a you go you just like and choose

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.850 
so a you go you just like and choose
which<00:04:08.260> tracks<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.740> want<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:10.530> there<00:04:11.530> we<00:04:11.620> go<00:04:11.740> up

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
which tracks you want and there we go up

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.260 
which tracks you want and there we go up
and<00:04:12.070> this<00:04:12.220> signaling<00:04:12.640> me<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.000> want<00:04:13.180> to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
and this signaling me that you want to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.730 
and this signaling me that you want to
ghost<00:04:13.450> Malik<00:04:13.840> since<00:04:14.050> he's<00:04:14.170> favorite<00:04:14.500> track

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
ghost Malik since he's favorite track

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.990 
ghost Malik since he's favorite track
it's<00:04:15.010> only<00:04:15.160> because<00:04:15.370> he<00:04:15.460> knows<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.760> can't

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
it's only because he knows you can't

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.180 
it's only because he knows you can't
beat<00:04:16.150> me<00:04:16.270> on<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.390> Bowser<00:04:16.660> track<00:04:17.020> twit<00:04:17.860> anywhere

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
beat me on a Bowser track twit anywhere

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.680 
beat me on a Bowser track twit anywhere
yeah<00:04:18.520> it<00:04:18.730> definitely<00:04:18.880> looks<00:04:19.270> like<00:04:19.330> it's<00:04:19.540> just

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
yeah it definitely looks like it's just

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
stopped still for a second and see if

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.860 
stopped still for a second and see if
yeah<00:04:27.760> I'm<00:04:27.880> not<00:04:28.030> getting<00:04:28.120> past<00:04:28.360> soil<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.840> just

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
yeah I'm not getting past soil is just

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.010 
yeah I'm not getting past soil is just
you<00:04:29.110> two<00:04:29.350> anyway<00:04:29.950> so<00:04:30.640> here<00:04:31.060> we<00:04:31.180> go<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:31.510> it's<00:04:31.780> a

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
you two anyway so here we go then it's a

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.300 
you two anyway so here we go then it's a
point<00:04:32.410> you're<00:04:32.500> on<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.650> match<00:04:32.800> race<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.280> is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
point you're on the match race it is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.310 
point you're on the match race it is
obviously<00:04:33.850> just<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> two<00:04:34.390> es<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.170> can

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
obviously just the two es and you can

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.600 
obviously just the two es and you can
still<00:04:35.500> hit<00:04:35.680> each<00:04:35.860> other<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.220> can<00:04:36.400> use<00:04:36.430> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
still hit each other you can use the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.830 
still hit each other you can use the
fall<00:04:36.850> off<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.090> track<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.510> likes<00:04:37.690> of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
fall off the track and the likes of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.840 
fall off the track and the likes of
shortcuts<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.530> can<00:04:38.620> use<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.520> stuff

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
shortcuts that you can use and stuff

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.910 
shortcuts that you can use and stuff
like<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.840> that's<00:04:41.380> pretty<00:04:41.620> much<00:04:41.740> the

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
like that so that's pretty much the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.710 
like that so that's pretty much the
mattress<00:04:42.310> now<00:04:42.880> while<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.150> show<00:04:43.390> you<00:04:43.450> some<00:04:43.600> the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
mattress now while I show you some the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.330 
mattress now while I show you some the
battle<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.170> I<00:04:44.230> just<00:04:44.410> very<00:04:44.500> quickly<00:04:44.800> over<00:04:45.040> said

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
battle so I just very quickly over said

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.400 
battle so I just very quickly over said
again<00:04:45.550> Gordon<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:46.780> battle<00:04:47.080> mode<00:04:47.200> now

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
again Gordon this in battle mode now

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.720 
again Gordon this in battle mode now
obviously<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.040> treats<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.310> characters<00:04:48.700> just

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
obviously it treats the characters just

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.820 
obviously it treats the characters just
like<00:04:48.940> usual<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.750> thus<00:04:49.960> for<00:04:50.140> battle<00:04:50.440> courses

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
like usual and thus for battle courses

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.350 
like usual and thus for battle courses
you<00:04:50.980> basically<00:04:51.220> push<00:04:51.460> start<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:51.940> view<00:04:52.120> them

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
you basically push start to view them

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.180 
you basically push start to view them
and<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.960> third<00:04:53.140> one<00:04:53.380> will<00:04:53.530> no<00:04:53.650> doubt<00:04:53.680> expands

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
and the third one will no doubt expands

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.860 
and the third one will no doubt expands
the<00:04:54.340> table<00:04:54.670> because<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.180> does<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.450> every

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
the table because it does this every

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.870 
the table because it does this every
single<00:04:56.050> time<00:04:56.230> just<00:04:56.680> like<00:04:56.740> empires<00:04:57.280> snow<00:04:57.610> stage

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
single time just like empires snow stage

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.840 
single time just like empires snow stage
does<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.930> snows<00:04:59.290> really<00:04:59.740> doesn't<00:04:59.980> like<00:05:00.040> HDTVs

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
does it snows really doesn't like HDTVs

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.150 
does it snows really doesn't like HDTVs
but<00:05:01.660> anyway<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.230> may<00:05:02.380> seem<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.680> limited

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
but anyway it may seem a bit limited

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.130 
but anyway it may seem a bit limited
compared<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.030> newer<00:05:04.240> ones<00:05:04.540> but<00:05:04.870> it's

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
compared to the newer ones but it's

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.950 
compared to the newer ones but it's
still<00:05:05.320> pretty<00:05:05.470> damn<00:05:05.740> good<00:05:05.890> anyway<00:05:06.420> so<00:05:07.420> the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
still pretty damn good anyway so the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.210 
still pretty damn good anyway so the
whole<00:05:08.140> point<00:05:08.320> about<00:05:08.380> morale<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:08.860> low<00:05:08.890> if<00:05:09.100> you

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
whole point about morale is low if you

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.800 
whole point about morale is low if you
see<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.580> see<00:05:09.760> him<00:05:09.880> it's<00:05:10.360> been<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.660> same

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
see it to see him it's been the same

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.030 
see it to see him it's been the same
pretty<00:05:11.050> much<00:05:11.170> every<00:05:11.410> time<00:05:11.530> when<00:05:11.680> every<00:05:11.860> Mario

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
pretty much every time when every Mario

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.070 
pretty much every time when every Mario
Kart<00:05:12.340> game<00:05:12.520> you've<00:05:12.730> got<00:05:12.760> three<00:05:13.120> items<00:05:13.630> hanging

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
Kart game you've got three items hanging

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.570 
it unfortunately are in fact that sort
it's<00:05:28.200> pretty<00:05:28.440> much<00:05:28.650> after<00:05:28.860> those<00:05:29.100> three<00:05:29.400> than

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
it's pretty much after those three than

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.630 
it's pretty much after those three than
you<00:05:29.640> have<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.850> start<00:05:30.090> another<00:05:30.210> battle<00:05:30.420> log<00:05:30.630> and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
unfortunately despite me being

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.240 
unfortunately despite me being
absolutely<00:05:34.200> positive<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.860> game<00:05:35.100> was

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
absolutely positive that this game was

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.760 
absolutely positive that this game was
for<00:05:35.430> player<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:36.120> is<00:05:36.420> unable<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.110> accept<00:05:37.560> my

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
for player it is unable to accept my

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.590 
for player it is unable to accept my
multi-touch<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.610> can<00:05:38.850> get<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.060> multi<00:05:39.300> tug<00:05:39.480> to

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
multi-touch I can get the multi tug to

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.970 
multi-touch I can get the multi tug to
work<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:39.960> like<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.230> street<00:05:40.440> racer<00:05:40.830> but

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
work and I like the street racer but

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.500 
work and I like the street racer but
this<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.430> just<00:05:41.610> won't<00:05:41.730> work<00:05:41.850> so<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.240> can<00:05:42.390> only

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
this it just won't work so I can only

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.690 
this it just won't work so I can only
assume<00:05:42.660> it<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.170> only<00:05:43.440> two<00:05:43.620> player<00:05:43.890> which<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:44.580> a

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
assume it is only two player which is a

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
thought I'd mention that just in case

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.120 
thought I'd mention that just in case
anyone<00:05:51.720> else<00:05:51.930> out<00:05:52.110> there<00:05:52.140> also<00:05:52.560> thought<00:05:52.950> that

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
anyone else out there also thought that

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.480 
anyone else out there also thought that
this<00:05:53.220> game<00:05:53.460> was<00:05:53.610> wobbly<00:05:54.020> so<00:05:55.020> this<00:05:55.860> is<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.040> pretty

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
this game was wobbly so this is a pretty

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.070 
this game was wobbly so this is a pretty
much<00:05:56.670> everything<00:05:57.000> yet<00:05:57.120> well<00:05:57.630> have<00:05:57.810> you<00:05:57.930> got

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
much everything yet well have you got

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.180 
much everything yet well have you got
nothing<00:05:58.200> else<00:05:58.380> with<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.740> see<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.860> was<00:05:59.070> guy

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
nothing else with it you see I was guy

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.740 
nothing else with it you see I was guy
so<00:05:59.340> this<00:05:59.400> is<00:05:59.460> pretty<00:05:59.640> much<00:05:59.760> everything<00:05:59.940> done

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
so this is pretty much everything done

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.870 
so this is pretty much everything done
but<00:06:01.020> I've<00:06:01.740> just<00:06:02.100> realized<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.550> need<00:06:02.700> to<00:06:02.790> look

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
but I've just realized I need to look

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.640 
but I've just realized I need to look
like<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.330> new<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.540> bit<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.870> music<00:06:04.230> and<00:06:04.380> I

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
like this new a bit the music and I

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:22.260 
like this new a bit the music and I
think<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:04.980> is<00:06:05.070> everything<00:06:05.400> I've<00:06:05.520> done

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
so there we go that was a bit the music

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.610 
so there we go that was a bit the music
