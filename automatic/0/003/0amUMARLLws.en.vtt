hardware<00:02:14.910> they<00:02:15.090> did<00:02:15.510> was<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.650> works

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
hardware they did was this and it works

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.010 
hardware they did was this and it works
terrific<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:17.940> does<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.240> work<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.420> how

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
terrific I how does it work like how

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.050 
terrific I how does it work like how
does<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:19.470> interface<00:02:19.890> together<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.520> let

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
does this all interface together and let

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.210 
does this all interface together and let
you<00:02:21.240> spin<00:02:21.570> how<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.870> want<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> spend<00:02:22.380> well<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
you spin how you want to spend well I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
you spin how you want to spend well I
think<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.700> these<00:02:23.940> time-coded<00:02:24.840> vinyl<00:02:24.870> right

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
think what these time-coded vinyl right

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.550 
think what these time-coded vinyl right
here<00:02:26.010> mm-hmm<00:02:26.370> allows<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> manipulate<00:02:27.780> by

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
here mm-hmm allows you to manipulate by

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.510 
here mm-hmm allows you to manipulate by
know<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.600> computer<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:31.980> what's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
know with your computer and it's what's

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.340 
know with your computer and it's what's
going<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:32.940> when<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.959> play<00:02:34.200> these

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
going on is that when you play these

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.840 
going on is that when you play these
finals<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:35.070> like<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> dial<00:02:35.520> tone<00:02:35.760> or

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
finals it's like a dial tone or

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.510 
finals it's like a dial tone or
something<00:02:36.060> like<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.860> signals<00:02:38.310> sent

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
something like that and the signals sent

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.670 
something like that and the signals sent
do<00:02:38.730> right<00:02:38.940> here<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> scratch<00:02:39.450> amp<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
system requirements for that or oh 512

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.120 
system requirements for that or oh 512

megabytes of ram minimal requirements
1.5<00:02:59.130> gigahertz<00:02:59.370> okay<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.170> standard

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
1.5 gigahertz okay so the standard

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
1.5 gigahertz okay so the standard
machine<00:03:02.130> better<00:03:02.550> yeah<00:03:02.940> obviously<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.690> more

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
machine better yeah obviously the more

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
machine better yeah obviously the more
the<00:03:03.989> better<00:03:04.110> than<00:03:04.320> anything<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.739> this

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the better than anything like this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the better than anything like this
actually<00:03:05.160> when<00:03:05.370> you're<00:03:05.459> dealing<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
is it takes the mp3 and you would load

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.240 
is it takes the mp3 and you would load
it<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.570> your<00:03:24.720> deck<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> software<00:03:26.070> here

that easy choices yes now what kind of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.069 
that easy choices yes now what kind of
bitrate<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.269> we<00:03:39.360> looking<00:03:39.600> at<00:03:39.660> here<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:39.959> for

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
bitrate are we looking at here like for

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.509 
bitrate are we looking at here like for
your<00:03:40.200> mp3<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.769> imagine<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.190> higher<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
your mp3 is that imagine the higher the

your mp3 is that imagine the higher the
better<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.850> higher<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.360> better<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.720> hide

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
better the higher the better to hide

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.850 
better the higher the better to hide
about<00:03:43.110> 300<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.730> 320<00:03:44.760> Phila<00:03:45.180> 4<00:03:45.390> mm<00:03:45.870> 44<00:03:46.350> kilobytes

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
as like sound quality digital versus

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.099 
as like sound quality digital versus
analog<00:04:17.790> what<00:04:18.389> are<00:04:18.449> we<00:04:18.540> looking<00:04:18.810> at<00:04:18.900> here<00:04:19.049> I

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
analog what are we looking at here I

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.590 
analog what are we looking at here I
mean<00:04:19.290> well<00:04:19.650> let<00:04:20.040> me<00:04:20.130> give<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.639> honest<00:04:21.000> truth<00:04:21.299> I

mean well let me give you honest truth I
still<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.470> vinyl<00:04:23.009> like<00:04:23.460> 300<00:04:24.000> vinyl<00:04:24.389> sounds

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
still think vinyl like 300 vinyl sounds

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.520 
still think vinyl like 300 vinyl sounds
better<00:04:26.310> than<00:04:26.639> digital<00:04:27.000> because<00:04:27.539> what<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.350> get

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
better than digital because what you get

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.520 
better than digital because what you get
is<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.740> lot<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:30.030> lot<00:04:30.449> of<00:04:30.600> bass<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> lot<00:04:31.199> of<00:04:31.320> beats

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
is a lot of a lot of bass a lot of beats

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.830 
is a lot of a lot of bass a lot of beats
and<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.250> lot<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.490> highs<00:04:32.669> in<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.060> well<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.479> only

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
and a lot of highs in this well the only

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.080 
and a lot of highs in this well the only
problem<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.199> these<00:04:34.380> are<00:04:34.680> very<00:04:35.009> fragile<00:04:35.340> when

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
problem that these are very fragile when

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.090 
problem that these are very fragile when
you<00:04:36.150> break<00:04:36.870> them<00:04:37.020> that's<00:04:37.289> it<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.680> done<00:04:37.860> it's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
you break them that's it it's done it's

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.439 
you break them that's it it's done it's
time<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.430> will<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:38.910> break<00:04:39.060> one<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.270> these

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
time to you will you break one of these

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.640 
time to you will you break one of these
you<00:04:39.570> can<00:04:39.600> just<00:04:39.720> go<00:04:40.020> store<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.380> buy<00:04:40.500> another
