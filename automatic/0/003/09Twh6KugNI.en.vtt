00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
and it's not that's much more expensive

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.859

than<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.830> regular<00:01:46.979> headset<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.820> kept<00:01:48.270> remember<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
than a regular headset I kept remember I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.080 
than a regular headset I kept remember I
think<00:01:48.960> Amazon<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.280> comes<00:01:50.520> free<00:01:50.790> shipping

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
think Amazon that comes free shipping

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.280 
think Amazon that comes free shipping
and<00:01:51.210> handling<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.990> paid<00:01:52.170> around

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and handling so I think I paid around

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
and handling so I think I paid around
fifty<00:01:52.740> seven<00:01:52.950> dollars<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:53.910> well<00:01:54.690> worth

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
fifty seven dollars for it so well worth

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
fifty seven dollars for it so well worth
it<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.140> opinion<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:56.340> only<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it in my opinion because not only that I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.450
