00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello friends like you neatly 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.069
 did not exploit the car on his 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.720
 back will still appear schools 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.550
 they usually occur on the leading edge 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.559
 hood on the hood on the mirrors 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 rear view and school wings this 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.300
 untidy and schools can become hotbeds 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.300
 corrosion 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.150
 car security company 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.310
 mastered the technology of local repair 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.980
 chipping paint let's 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.689
 We learn more about it and understand 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.669
 with technology will help us head 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.850
 center car protection andrey tchiterin 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.559
 gray hi i heard you were looking for this 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.660
 technology is not one year that is sifted 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.879
 many different options on so yes it is 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 really so because you are a service 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.820
 local repair of chips she 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.650
 claimed and 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.059
 the client often asks about but we 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.949
 could not offer a decent option 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.750
 for our customers we tested 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.600
 many technologies represented on 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.180
 world market and settled on 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 technology doctor to casket in our opinion 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.360
 This technology is recognized by experts as 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.100
 i see the best in this area here q-lab 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.019
 this car is very badly damaged 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.840
 there are literally no living space from chipping 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.310
 can it all be restored yes 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.110
 really natalya so cars 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.590
 such a number of words that they are even difficult 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 count 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.119
 but we will try to shoot hi 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.009
 which you are their alkynes I suggest for 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.290
 visibility stick dividing 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.220
 lane and see it was and it became 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.220
 you are welcome 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.750
 Andrei using what materials 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.159
 paint coating stops 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.900
 technology doctor to casket allows 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.290
 work with absolutely any colors 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.580
 any cars and now 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.970
 work with this car we will start with 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.970
 selection 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.820
 First, the master chooses the paint color 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.170
 and body tint in the tanks is 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.229
 special enamel possessing 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.340
 the ability to fill chips 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.260
 paint is applied to damaged areas 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.060
 dotted with a brush master 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.040
 makes sure that soon completely flooded 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.470
 paint has very good adhesion 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.420
 therefore creates a durable layer while the hood 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.739
 doesnâ€™t look very neat 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.750
 they tried to paint it with 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.280
 traditional ointment varnish for chipping but 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.280
 the fun begins now 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.319
 master takes an abrasive slurry with 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.700
 very fine grain size puts on 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.440
 special cloth which is not 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.540
 leaves traces on the body and starting 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.860
 wash off excess paint surface 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.000
 aligned rebuilding 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.000
 original shape and color 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.700
 the hood of this car was beaten very badly 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.930
 therefore fully regain form with 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.269
 first time failed 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.989
 don't worry another paint coat is applied and 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.550
 also rubbed with abrasive compound 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.200
 the whole secret of the materials used 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.790
 paint abrasive composition is selected and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.470
 so that when repairing cleaved 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.870
 it turned out as if the alignment itself 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.760
 the surface is very important that the process though 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.230
 and painstaking but uncomplicated influence 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:14.360
 human factor practically 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:15.860
 excluded well, that's basically the result 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.690
 such an impression 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.519
 but the result is visible to the naked eye 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.530
 here only on the dirt from whom remained 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.500
 they are bright white very contrasting 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.370
 looks on a particularly dark surface 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.379
 actions not only that they are all 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.160
 they became even body color 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.170
 so 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.209
 but I think no expert at all no 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.360
 will notice that this car was in 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.489
 what time is it 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 takes up all repairs on this half 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.970
 the hood you spent 30 minutes at all the whole 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.970
 car do frequencies 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.130
 single recovery cost 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.870
 car about three and a half to five 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.690
 thousand rubles depending on the class 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.490
 cars and the number of chips important plus 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.709
 new technologies of preserving factory 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.390
 paint coating thickness if 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.550
 complete repainting of an element can be revealed 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.560
 using a thickness gauge here in fact 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.950
 no repainting occurs enamel 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.030
 fills themselves exclusively chipped 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.739
 Perhaps this is the first repair technology 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.030
 chips that provide high 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.380
 surface quality and does not require 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.380
 capital investment
