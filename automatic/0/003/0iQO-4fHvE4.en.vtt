00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
it's kind of southwest of it and be

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.010 
it's kind of southwest of it and be
southeast<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.910> dawn<00:00:21.090> star<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> kind<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.840> meat

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
southeast of dawn star it kind of meat

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.470 
southeast of dawn star it kind of meat
sauce<00:00:22.289> between<00:00:22.710> them<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.449> some

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
sauce between them so here are some

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.870 
sauce between them so here are some
locations<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.410> both<00:00:25.650> sides<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.279> maybe<00:00:26.519> that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
locations on both sides and maybe that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.980 
locations on both sides and maybe that
will<00:00:27.060> keep<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.960> location<00:00:28.439> itself<00:00:28.880> and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
will keep on the location itself and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.820 
will keep on the location itself and
once<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> be

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
once you get in there's going to be

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.020 
once you get in there's going to be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
around for traps and the word wall of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.510 
around for traps and the word wall of
course<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:37.260> I'll<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.860> through<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
course so I'll get through all of that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
course so I'll get through all of that
stuff<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.329> show<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> where<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.960> out

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
stuff and I'll show you where it's out

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.229 
stuff and I'll show you where it's out
on<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.350> map<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.250> where<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.149> actual

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
on your map and then where the actual

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.010 
on your map and then where the actual
thing<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> game<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> first<00:00:45.870> one

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
thing is in the game so the first one

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290 
thing is in the game so the first one
that<00:00:46.079> we're<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> cover<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> main

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that we're going to cover is in the main

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.260 
that we're going to cover is in the main
area<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> once<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.640> come<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.969> you'll<00:00:51.149> be

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
area so once you come in you'll be

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
area so once you come in you'll be
facing<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.840> entrance<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
facing the entrance and this is on the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420 
facing the entrance and this is on the
lower<00:00:53.370> level<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> look<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.250> you'll

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
lower level so if you look up you'll

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
lower level so if you look up you'll
come<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.760> from<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.090> they're<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
come in from if they're right there and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.970 
come in from if they're right there and
you'll<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.160> drop<00:00:59.309> down<00:00:59.550> here<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> once<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you'll just drop down here so once you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.500 
you'll just drop down here so once you
come<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.449> pull<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> right

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
come in if you pull this on the right

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.320 
come in if you pull this on the right
it'll<00:01:06.510> open<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.960> door<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.850> next<00:01:09.030> couple

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it'll open this door and the next couple

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.429 
it'll open this door and the next couple
are<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.290> you'll<00:01:10.320> experience
