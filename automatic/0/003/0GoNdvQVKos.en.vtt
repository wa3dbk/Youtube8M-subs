00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.490
 hello my name is baptist 27 years old my 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.099
 road trip 5500 km around France in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 bike in two months so what I hope 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.439
 of this trip it's simply 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:24.060
 meet and discover a maximum of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.980
 world of culture landscapes of everything 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 what makes france 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 so my course i'm going to leave 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.150
 honfleur in the direction of the needles 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 a watch 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 so I'm going to go north why 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.600
 clockwise 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.859
 simply because 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.480
 seems that the wind would be more favorable 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.649
 end more often favorable in this sense 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.089
 there so I'm going to listen to the messages that 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.820
 have gone before me and leave in the 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.710
 clockwise and in 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.290
 two words my path is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.309
 so from honfleur back up 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.670
 calais gravelines after direction east 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.550
 strasbourg and after heading south to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.360
 monaco grosso modo after I'm going to follow 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.640
 the mediterranean cross the Pyrenees 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.640
 along the Atlantic Ocean Brittany 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.120
 back to Normandy to complete the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.480
 simply loop back on evreux 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.990
 so what do you think of this road trip my 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.090
 friends my family etc 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.490
 it's first of all the madness of 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.380
 worry also often asks where 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.050
 are you going to sleep how are you going 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.350
 to make boobies that they did it before 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.140
 me 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.160
 all reassures me so no problem 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.980
 it's almost a choice to leave everything 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.150
 only it allows to meet more 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.650
 easily from the world people are more 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.950
 endorsement when we are when we travel 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.570
 only after I know that it will weigh 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.140
 from time to time it's pretty much a 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.260
 certainty but from there to be afraid no 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.070
 no no not at all then my equipment 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.580
 I chose 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.760
 a vtc basic that I arranged so 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.350
 I put bag 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.390
 i put a gps on it i have any system 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.900
 electric I am autonomous so with 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.370
 our means says me dynamo in the hub 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.450
 to be able to charge my smartphone 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 batteries 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 everything I would need during the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.450
 trip 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.940
 what I'm expecting also these two 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.730
 to know where are my limits the challenge 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.360
 physical is something that attracts me 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.360
 enormously enormously 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.830
 I hope so, thank you very much 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.830
