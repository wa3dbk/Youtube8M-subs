00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the fluid in any Norwalk juicer the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.759 
the fluid in any Norwalk juicer the
first<00:00:12.150> step<00:00:12.420> will<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.809> remove<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.320> press

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
first step will be to remove the press

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.109 
first step will be to remove the press
plate<00:00:14.150> which<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:16.039> loosen<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.430> nut<00:00:17.970> at

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
plate which you can loosen the nut at

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.550 
plate which you can loosen the nut at
the<00:00:18.270> bottom<00:00:18.600> which<00:00:18.720> I've<00:00:18.869> already<00:00:19.020> done<00:00:19.170> can

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the bottom which I've already done can

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.980 
the bottom which I've already done can
make<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> scroll<00:00:20.130> faster<00:00:20.420> you<00:00:21.420> take<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
make the scroll faster you take out the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
make the scroll faster you take out the
guide<00:00:22.170> post<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:24.180> press<00:00:24.420> plate<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:26.090> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
guide post and the press plate and the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.109 
guide post and the press plate and the
next<00:00:27.420> step<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> remove<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.680> three<00:00:28.949> screws

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
next step is to remove the three screws

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.429 
next step is to remove the three screws
around<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.539> press<00:00:30.779> cover<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.260> have

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
around the press cover which have

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.850 
around the press cover which have
already<00:00:31.590> done<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.910> remove<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.960> front<00:00:34.170> cover

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.810 

now<00:00:37.860> your<00:00:38.129> next<00:00:38.520> step<00:00:38.760> will<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.210> remove<00:00:40.820> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
now your next step will be to remove the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.520 
now your next step will be to remove the
three<00:00:42.210> bolts<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.170> six<00:00:43.440> bolts<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.700> top<00:00:44.969> of

three bolts the six bolts in the top of
the<00:00:46.530> reservoir<00:00:48.020> now<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> do

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the reservoir now I'm not going to do

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.619 
the reservoir now I'm not going to do
that<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.030> relatively

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that because it's relatively

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
that because it's relatively
straightforward<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> next<00:00:53.670> video

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you will see me replacing the fluid and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.910 
you will see me replacing the fluid and

get the bottom overing out but you can

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:21.780 
get the bottom overing out but you can
use<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.280> safety<00:02:09.519> pin<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.060> bend<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.479> it

and continue soaking up the rest of that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.860 
and continue soaking up the rest of that
fluid<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.720> paper<00:02:28.989> towel<00:02:30.870> until

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the next step is to purge the pump and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.780 
the next step is to purge the pump and
the<00:02:35.110> way<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> do<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.799> turn<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.400> machine

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
the way you do this is turn the machine

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:50.699 
the way you do this is turn the machine

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
new o-rings that I'm putting in the top

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.860 
new o-rings that I'm putting in the top
I<00:03:03.310> already<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.819> new<00:03:04.969> one<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.420> piston

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
I already have the new one in the piston

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.610 
I already have the new one in the piston
got<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.739> new<00:03:06.920> one<00:03:07.069> on<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.310> piston<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.200> let's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
got a new one on the piston and let's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.040 
got a new one on the piston and let's
see<00:03:09.950> where<00:03:10.280> did<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.040 

we<00:03:14.110> are

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.230 

the<00:03:17.260> piston<00:03:17.650> goes<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> small<00:03:18.430> end

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
the piston goes in the small end

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:31.210 
the piston goes in the small end
comes<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.290> chamber<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.770> next<00:03:31.010> step

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
comes in the chamber and the next step

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.730 
comes in the chamber and the next step
is<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.550> pour<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:31.970> fresh<00:03:32.360> oil<00:03:33.790> hydraulic<00:03:34.790> fluid

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.660 

I<00:03:37.830> love<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.550> clear<00:03:38.940> fluid<00:03:39.980> jack<00:03:40.980> oil<00:03:41.250> or

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
I love this clear fluid jack oil or

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.260 
I love this clear fluid jack oil or
hydraulic<00:03:42.240> fluid

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.100 

that<00:03:50.810> looks<00:03:51.050> like<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.470> give<00:03:51.680> other<00:03:51.890> message

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
that looks like to give other message

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.309 
that looks like to give other message
and<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.590> last<00:03:54.800> step<00:03:55.070> is<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.850> put<00:03:56.060> on<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.240> top

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.780 

there's<00:03:59.439> enough

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
there's enough

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:13.120 
there's enough
attention<00:04:01.510> they're<00:04:01.690> cold

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.509 

there<00:04:13.790> we<00:04:14.030> go<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:14.930> of<00:04:15.140> course<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.710> last<00:04:15.890> step

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
there we go and of course the last step

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:31.189 
there we go and of course the last step
is<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.180> put<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:18.629> bolts

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.230 

when<00:04:31.469> you<00:04:31.590> put<00:04:31.800> in<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.039> bolts<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.849> tighten

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
when you put in the bolts you tighten

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.600 
when you put in the bolts you tighten
them<00:04:33.330> just<00:04:33.569> like<00:04:33.689> you<00:04:33.749> do<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:33.990> car<00:04:34.289> tire

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
them just like you do a car tire

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.570 
them just like you do a car tire
opposites

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.840 

so<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:40.750> video<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.620> not<00:04:41.800> too<00:04:42.070> long<00:04:42.250> I'm

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
so that this video is not too long I'm

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.970 
so that this video is not too long I'm
going<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.210> end<00:04:43.420> here<00:04:43.540> finish<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.500> rest<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.830> it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
going to end here finish the rest of it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.510 
going to end here finish the rest of it
and<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.670> hope<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.000> found<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.330> helpful
