super<00:02:23.760> hard<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.150> help<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> said<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.930> triple

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
super hard is help you said it a triple

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.260 
super hard is help you said it a triple
twist<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.830> she<00:02:25.980> stroked<00:02:26.340> struggled<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.090> and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
twist that she stroked struggled on and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.080 
twist that she stroked struggled on and
work<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:29.069> see<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> air<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> legs

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
work out you see the air is the legs

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.150 
work out you see the air is the legs
apart<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.590> big<00:02:32.040> big<00:02:32.550> step<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> side

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
apart and that big big step to the side

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.550 
apart and that big big step to the side
that'll<00:02:35.160> cost<00:02:35.310> her
