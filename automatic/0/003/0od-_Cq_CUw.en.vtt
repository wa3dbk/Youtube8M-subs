00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320
 kids here from Lewis commenting 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.730
 now all of us and good welcome 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840
 to a new server we are in the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.389
 server that the truth is that it is very 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.800
 It has just started and it would be appreciated 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 that you pass because the truth is that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 It's very good and it's pretty pretty 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 correct what would come to be the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 modality that has in this case is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.179
 good factions let's start and let's 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.509
 appear here in this spanish and good and 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.310
 Fully feasible servers full pp 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.350
 for pvp lovers that I have 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.240
 many servers and this server is going 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 to come very well so good 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.440
 you're going to start with a valley kit that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 it would be this of the two plus the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 two wooden stakes then the dynamite 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 steaks and golden apples 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 besides the sword and the armor that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.240
 we have here today eat an apple I know 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 why but the good thing is that they give you 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.870
 all this to start that is quite 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.930
 well and good once we start we can 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 come by here already to the portal by the way 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 for the people who ask me and I know 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 I wanted to put bar blogging voucher and the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 password that is and then but before 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.150
 login you have to register yourself 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.030
 put to resist and the password that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.880
 want 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 I usually say this and there is always 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.450
 someone who asks me but good 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.700
 I'll say it again here is pretty 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.080
 easy addition and it's already good for 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.240
 start here when we go through the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.190
 portal we will have the store worth the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620
 store is pretty good 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.660
 we have everything here that sells us in 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.310
 Money has told me that you have since 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.990
 every time we kill a new agent 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.030
 is going to give us money so we can 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.150
 buy all this up here tells us 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.180
 a position that the type is and such for 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.190
 here is to know the holter if we want a 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.320
 horse and ride to him is very well the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.180
 It really has a lot and here it's good 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.820
 we can love when we kill many 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 animals or different things good 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.840
 I will also teach you a little bit to 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.420
 how are you going about the fact ians is worth seeing 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.250
 go down here if we put bar efe 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.380
 Obviously we will get the commands 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.150
 factions you will say but if here 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.240
 there are only a few worth the easiest 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.980
 is to put bar efe el and here they come out 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.870
 well here before when we put 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.940
 bar ft the pages come out then 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.650
 you put two and you get more commands 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.930
 You can wear you too and the truth 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.940
 is that it 's pretty easy to create a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.290
 faction and enjoy here with your 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.380
 friends so it's not that difficult either 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.840
 to throw people good luck for 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.340
 create zones to put money on 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.940
 money obviously has to be put in 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.610
 a faction because if I do not load it 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.830
 and nothing then serves to continue the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.020
 factions and it gets bigger 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.660
 like more money then obviously you go 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.530
 to make bigger clay peeing to areas and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.990
 I'm here 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.990
 in six are to see I'm going to kill this 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.750
 and as you can see, he just gave me five 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.459
 dollars for killing a one sheep so 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.200
 it's pretty good the truth you can 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.970
 earn enough money and that's how easy it is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.890
 to stay is a faction and as I already 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.660
 I say if you come here with friends this 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.069
 it can be the pump so good 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.050
 I hope you liked the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.120
 server as you can see is very practical 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.890
 and very simple but it has been for people 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.410
 who loves pvp and who likes to play 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.900
 facto of this area that by the way is a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.269
 Ski area is protected and is lowered 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 for these four holes that are here like this 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.840
 what good guys like I said to the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.700
 I would appreciate it if you would come to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.380
 play is like if you are playing a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.910
 faction about you have thought about playing a 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.130
 factions that you do not have here with 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.500
 your friends and you will have a great time 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.299
 and good kids in the sunset 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.100
 here we say goodbye I hope you have 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.660
 liked the server as I always say 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.670
 you will have all the social networks of 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.260
 server and mine in the description well 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.030
 how good I wait for you on this server and 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.530
 I will also be playing and even the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.890
 next 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.890
 goodbye
