today in our class at a very common
concept<00:00:12.990> about<00:00:13.320> programming<00:00:13.799> language

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
concept about programming language

called variable lengths we've been

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.150 
called variable lengths we've been
talking<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.190> storage<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> memory<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.160> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
talking about storage and memory and a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.849 
talking about storage and memory and a
variable<00:00:20.609> name<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.480> label<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> location

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
variable name is a label for a location

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.970 
variable name is a label for a location
in<00:00:23.250> memory<00:00:23.600> every<00:00:24.600> location<00:00:25.080> has<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
in memory every location has to have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.670 
in memory every location has to have
something<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.900> identify<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
something to identify it and from the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
something to identify it and from the
programmers<00:00:29.340> point<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.730> view<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.210> you're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
programmers point of view what you're

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
programmers point of view what you're
going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.720> use<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.929> identify<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> label<00:00:32.399> for

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
going to use to identify as a label for

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.180 
going to use to identify as a label for
a<00:00:32.910> location<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.600> memory<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
a location in memory you can think of a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.240 
a location in memory you can think of a
location<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.910> memory<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.840> container<00:00:37.469> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
location in memory as a container so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
location in memory as a container so
consider<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.850> perhaps<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.510> shoebox<00:00:40.070> any<00:00:41.070> kind

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
consider this perhaps a shoebox any kind

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910 
consider this perhaps a shoebox any kind
of<00:00:41.550> container<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.170> computer's<00:00:43.649> memory

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
of container and the computer's memory

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.569 
of container and the computer's memory
is<00:00:44.340> made<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.969> millions<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:46.140> containers<00:00:46.579> so

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is made up of millions of containers so

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
is made up of millions of containers so
you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.940> put<00:00:48.180> something<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.440> what

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you can put something in here now what

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100 
you can put something in here now what
can<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> put<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.520> well<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.899> put

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
can you put in there well you can put

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.560 
can you put in there well you can put
things<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.559> there<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.920> numeric<00:00:53.489> values<00:00:56.570> like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
things in there like numeric values like

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.729 
things in there like numeric values like
any<00:00:57.840> number<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:59.030> 15.3<00:01:00.030> 27<00:01:01.020> any<00:01:01.289> number<00:01:01.710> a

in memory for example you have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.130 
in memory for example you have
information<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.990> be

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
information about you that would be

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310 
information about you that would be
invariant<00:01:07.680> value<00:01:08.070> your<00:01:08.909> score<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> last

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
average for the course is perhaps you'd

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
average for the course is perhaps you'd
need<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.590> score<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:21.030> container

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
need to have that score in a container

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
need to have that score in a container
in<00:01:21.840> memory<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.430> location<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.150> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
in memory and that location for this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.530

program<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> tell<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> computer

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
program is going to tell the computer

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.999 
program is going to tell the computer
what<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.310> step<00:01:29.369> by<00:01:29.850> step<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> program

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
what to do step by step so the program

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
what to do step by step so the program
will<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.490> come<00:01:32.640> back<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> refer<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
will have to come back and refer to this

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.520 
will have to come back and refer to this
location<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.790> order<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.960> needs<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
location in order to do that it needs a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.219 
location in order to do that it needs a
name<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> variable<00:01:40.049> name

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
name for it that's what a variable name

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.180 
name for it that's what a variable name
is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:42.200> variable<00:01:43.200> name

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
is a variable name

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.540 
is a variable name
is<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.640> name<00:01:45.120> for<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.720> location<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.650> container<00:01:47.190> in

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
is a name for a location or container in

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.420 
is a name for a location or container in
memory<00:01:47.940> for<00:01:48.480> example<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:49.890> call<00:01:50.160> this

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
memory for example we could call this

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
memory for example we could call this
location<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:53.000> test<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.050> we<00:01:55.470> can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
location right here test one and we can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.810 
location right here test one and we can
put<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> score<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> location<00:01:57.110> let's<00:01:58.110> say

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
put a score in that location let's say

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.210 
put a score in that location let's say
85<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> numeric<00:02:02.010> value

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
85 and so now we have a numeric value

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.820 
85 and so now we have a numeric value
stored<00:02:02.910> in<00:02:03.120> a<00:02:03.180> location<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:03.840> memory<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.800> a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
stored in a location in memory with a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.970 
stored in a location in memory with a
variable<00:02:05.340> name<00:02:05.630> besides<00:02:06.630> numeric<00:02:07.230> values<00:02:07.710> we

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
variable name besides numeric values we

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.710 
variable name besides numeric values we
can<00:02:08.100> put<00:02:08.280> another<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.940> value<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
can put another kind of value out there

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.790 
can put another kind of value out there
that's<00:02:10.380> just<00:02:10.880> or<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:13.230> character<00:02:13.830> value<00:02:15.800> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that's just or and character value and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.230 
that's just or and character value and
of<00:02:16.920> course<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.460> information<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:18.090> that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
of course you have information like that

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.240 
of course you have information like that
stored<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.170> computer's<00:02:19.620> memory<00:02:19.890> also<00:02:20.850> if

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
stored in a computer's memory also if

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.010 
stored in a computer's memory also if
the<00:02:23.250> computer<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.670> performing<00:02:24.300> some<00:02:24.330> action

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the computer is performing some action

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.200 
the computer is performing some action
on<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> date<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.890> might<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.580> example<00:02:26.610> your

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
on a date it might be for example your

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.340 
on a date it might be for example your
last<00:02:27.420> name<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.330> can<00:02:30.540> store<00:02:30.750> character

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
last name so you can store character

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.800 
last name so you can store character
information<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.220> location<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.880> memory<00:02:33.030> but

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
information in a location in memory but

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.140 
information in a location in memory but
once<00:02:34.080> again<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> name<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.610> box<00:02:35.850> as

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
once again you have to name the box as

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330 
once again you have to name the box as
well<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.930> name<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> box<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.160> name

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
well and the name for the box the name

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.980 
well and the name for the box the name
for<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> container<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> variable<00:02:39.960> name

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
for the container is the variable name

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.170 
for the container is the variable name
so<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.130> could<00:02:41.280> call<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.520> container<00:02:42.090> right

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so we could call this container right

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.880 
so we could call this container right
here<00:02:42.390> where<00:02:42.900> we're<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.350> put<00:02:43.440> someone's

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
here where we're going to put someone's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.210 
here where we're going to put someone's
last<00:02:44.100> name<00:02:44.630> we<00:02:45.630> could<00:02:45.780> call<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.110> name<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.010> name

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
last name we could call it name but name

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.280 
last name we could call it name but name
is<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.520> pretty<00:02:47.730> generic<00:02:47.940> term<00:02:48.540> like<00:02:48.870> name<00:02:49.140> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
is a pretty generic term like name of

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
label our container in memory so that we

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.840 
label our container in memory so that we

can refer to it some other examples
let's<00:03:06.090> put<00:03:06.239> another<00:03:06.450> box<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.350> say<00:03:07.709> we're

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
let's put another box here and say we're

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.479 
let's put another box here and say we're
going<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.220> label<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.390> box<00:03:10.070> or<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
going to label this box or have the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.630 
going to label this box or have the
computer<00:03:11.880> label<00:03:12.270> for<00:03:12.510> us<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.170> box<00:03:13.860> called<00:03:14.220> test2

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
computer label for us a box called test2

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.490 
computer label for us a box called test2
and<00:03:15.090> we're<00:03:15.269> going<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.450> put<00:03:15.630> our<00:03:15.810> score<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.440> our

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
and we're going to put our score on our

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.920 
and we're going to put our score on our
second<00:03:17.100> test<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:18.180> box<00:03:18.450> right<00:03:18.570> here

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
second test in that box right here

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.170 
second test in that box right here
another<00:03:19.260> numeric<00:03:19.769> value<00:03:20.130> stored<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.580> location

another numeric value stored in location
in<00:03:21.300> memory<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.620> now<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.670> power<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.180> do

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
in memory so now we have the power to do

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.390 
in memory so now we have the power to do
something<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.080> computer<00:03:25.560> because<00:03:26.250> we

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
something with the computer because we

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.460 
something with the computer because we
can<00:03:26.550> go<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.760> test<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.750> get<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.170> store

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
can go to test one and get it to store

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.620 
can go to test one and get it to store
and<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.130> go<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.310> test<00:03:29.670> two<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.269> get<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
and we can go to test two and get the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.290 
and we can go to test two and get the
score<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.200> tell<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.010> computer<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.700> use<00:03:32.910> the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
score and tell the computer to use the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.229 
score and tell the computer to use the
ALU<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.230> arithmetic<00:03:34.500> logic<00:03:34.830> unit<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:36.060> add

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
ALU the arithmetic logic unit to add

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.360 
ALU the arithmetic logic unit to add
those<00:03:36.570> two<00:03:36.840> numbers<00:03:36.870> together<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.860> divide<00:03:38.340> by

that formula in the box our next step

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.370 
that formula in the box our next step
might<00:04:14.609> be<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:15.090> take<00:04:15.269> this<00:04:15.510> information<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
might be to take this information and

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.710 
might be to take this information and
send<00:04:16.949> it<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> printer<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.359> we<00:04:18.449> want<00:04:18.630> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
send it to the printer so if we want to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.240 
send it to the printer so if we want to
print<00:04:18.840> out<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.169> name<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.560> students<00:04:19.949> we

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
print out the name of the students we

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.159 
print out the name of the students we
could<00:04:20.579> send<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.120> Box<00:04:21.329> called<00:04:21.599> students

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
could send it to the Box called students

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.560 
could send it to the Box called students
we<00:04:22.710> can<00:04:22.860> get<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.190> information<00:04:23.430> which<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.449> this

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
we can get the information which in this

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.839 
we can get the information which in this
case<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:25.080> text<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.620> character<00:04:26.009> value<00:04:26.160> and

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
case is text or a character value and

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.909 
case is text or a character value and
tell<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.660> send<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.139> printer<00:04:28.320> if

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
tell it to send it to the printer if

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.200 
tell it to send it to the printer if
we're<00:04:29.099> gonna<00:04:29.190> pretend<00:04:29.550> like<00:04:29.699> this<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.060> what

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
we're gonna pretend like this is what

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.820 
we're gonna pretend like this is what
the<00:04:30.300> protect<00:04:30.690> printer<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.169> producing<00:04:31.620> right

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
the protect printer is producing right

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.860 
the protect printer is producing right
here<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.190> could<00:04:32.310> write<00:04:32.490> Smith<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.780> we

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
here it could write Smith and then we

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.540 
here it could write Smith and then we
can<00:04:34.020> tell<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.289> perhaps<00:04:34.590> all<00:04:34.830> we<00:04:35.009> need<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.220> write

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
can tell it perhaps all we need to write

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.010 
can tell it perhaps all we need to write
out<00:04:35.759> is<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:37.080> average<00:04:37.349> for<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.009> semester<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
out is the average for the semester and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.150 
out is the average for the semester and
we<00:04:40.020> could<00:04:40.169> write<00:04:40.349> out<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.650> average<00:04:40.800> right

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
we could write out the average right

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.529 
we could write out the average right
there<00:04:41.400> send<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:41.820> number<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.300> printer

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
there send that number to the printer

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.629 
there send that number to the printer
also<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.110> then<00:04:43.410> go<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.130> next<00:04:44.340> student

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
also and then go on to the next student

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.670 
also and then go on to the next student
we're<00:04:45.330> going<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.660> look<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.990> what<00:04:46.289> some<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.530> our

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
we're going to look in what some of our

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.550 
we're going to look in what some of our
next<00:04:47.009> sections<00:04:47.460> about<00:04:48.240> how<00:04:48.630> we<00:04:48.690> decide<00:04:49.229> what

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
next sections about how we decide what

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.860 
next sections about how we decide what
to<00:04:49.710> name<00:04:49.889> each<00:04:50.310> one<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.759> these<00:04:50.910> locations

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
to name each one of these locations

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.080 
to name each one of these locations
right<00:04:52.440> here<00:04:52.650> or<00:04:52.889> containers<00:04:53.550> where<00:04:53.849> we<00:04:53.940> can

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
right here or containers where we can

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.120 
right here or containers where we can
put<00:04:54.300> things<00:04:54.479> how<00:04:55.229> we<00:04:55.289> come<00:04:55.650> up<00:04:55.800> with<00:04:55.919> these

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
put things how we come up with these

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.529 
put things how we come up with these
variable<00:04:56.520> names<00:04:56.729> because<00:04:57.120> there<00:04:57.240> are<00:04:57.360> some

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
variable names because there are some

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.510 
variable names because there are some
rules<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:57.900> those<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:59.010> we're<00:04:59.159> going<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.310> also

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
rules for those and we're going to also

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.790 
rules for those and we're going to also
look<00:04:59.669> at<00:04:59.970> what<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.330> can<00:05:00.510> do<00:05:00.780> with<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.229> values

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
look at what we can do with the values

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.460 
look at what we can do with the values
numeric<00:05:02.430> values<00:05:02.880> or<00:05:03.150> character<00:05:03.750> text<00:05:04.050> values

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
numeric values or character text values

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.899 
numeric values or character text values
that<00:05:04.710> we<00:05:04.830> have<00:05:05.010> into<00:05:05.310> each<00:05:05.460> one<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.699> these

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
that we have into each one of these

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.360 
that we have into each one of these
locations

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370
