hello<00:00:46.929> Rowan<00:00:47.289> asymmetry<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.159> welcome<00:00:48.399> back

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
hello Rowan asymmetry and welcome back

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.819 
hello Rowan asymmetry and welcome back
to<00:00:48.789> another<00:00:48.820> hearthstone<00:00:49.390> mention<00:00:49.839> this<00:00:50.530> one

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
to another hearthstone mention this one

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.250 
to another hearthstone mention this one
is<00:00:51.159> called<00:00:51.430> booted<00:00:51.909> middle<00:00:52.149> minecraft<00:00:52.629> and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
is called booted middle minecraft and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.170 
is called booted middle minecraft and
the<00:00:53.469> way<00:00:53.589> it<00:00:53.649> works<00:00:53.890> is<00:00:54.100> uses<00:00:54.399> command<00:00:54.909> blocks

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
the way it works is uses command blocks

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.770 
the way it works is uses command blocks
add<00:00:55.570> some<00:00:55.839> in<00:00:56.019> an<00:00:56.229> invisible<00:00:57.010> skeleton<00:00:57.780> with

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
add some in an invisible skeleton with

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.429 
add some in an invisible skeleton with
the<00:00:59.140> player<00:00:59.409> head<00:00:59.769> on<00:00:59.979> of<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.789> boof<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:02.049> I'm

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.439 
the player head on of a boof so I'm

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.049 
the player head on of a boof so I'm
gonna<00:01:02.589> get<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:02.949> Redstone<00:01:03.399> and<00:01:03.429> show<00:01:04.000> you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
gonna get to the Redstone and show you

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.719 
gonna get to the Redstone and show you
how<00:01:04.269> it's<00:01:04.449> done<00:01:04.539> and<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.340> how<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.549> works

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
how it's done and this is how it works

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.510 
how it's done and this is how it works
so<00:01:07.390> right<00:01:07.539> over<00:01:07.750> here<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.289> have<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:08.649> very<00:01:09.190> quick

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
so right over here you have a very quick

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.389 
so right over here you have a very quick
one<00:01:09.909> tick<00:01:10.240> redstone<00:01:10.840> clock<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.830> goes<00:01:12.069> into

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
one tick redstone clock that goes into

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.910 
one tick redstone clock that goes into
this<00:01:12.729> has<00:01:12.970> four<00:01:13.240> command<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:14.319> when<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.679> get<00:01:14.799> to

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
this has four command so when you get to

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.859 
this has four command so when you get to
the<00:01:15.069> area<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.700> will<00:01:15.880> summon<00:01:16.209> the<00:01:16.390> skeletons

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
the area it will summon the skeletons

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.809 
the area it will summon the skeletons
because<00:01:17.289> this<00:01:17.530> will<00:01:17.679> test<00:01:17.860> true<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.459> power

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
because this will test true and power

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.180 
because this will test true and power
these<00:01:19.270> four<00:01:19.509> command<00:01:19.780> blocks<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.319> this<00:01:21.039> is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
these four command blocks and this is

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.520 
these four command blocks and this is
probably<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.759> most<00:01:21.789> complex<00:01:22.270> part<00:01:22.539> so<00:01:23.380> if<00:01:23.440> you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
probably the most complex part so if you

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.020 
probably the most complex part so if you
go<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.830> very<00:01:24.039> beginning<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.580> this<00:01:24.729> command

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
go to the very beginning of this command

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.320 
go to the very beginning of this command
and<00:01:25.299> summons<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.869> skeleton<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.610> is<00:01:28.000> six

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
and summons a skeleton that is six

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330 
and summons a skeleton that is six
blocks<00:01:28.450> in<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.929> positive<00:01:29.080> y-direction<00:01:29.470> ten

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
blocks in the positive y-direction ten

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.859 
blocks in the positive y-direction ten
blocks<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.759> positive<00:01:31.060> z-direction<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.750> can

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
blocks and positive z-direction you can

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.090 
blocks and positive z-direction you can
have<00:01:31.959> that<00:01:32.110> whatever<00:01:32.439> you<00:01:32.530> want<00:01:32.679> of<00:01:32.860> course

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
have that whatever you want of course

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.730 
have that whatever you want of course
