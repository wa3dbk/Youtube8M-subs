00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.050 
England we used to do that a little bit
but<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> important<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> note<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> even

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
but the important thing to note is even

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.429 
but the important thing to note is even
though<00:01:51.149> he<00:01:51.270> makes<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> initial<00:01:52.020> shuffle<00:01:52.350> or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that initial movement of his after that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.639 
that initial movement of his after that
he<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:54.960> balanced<00:01:55.470> position

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
he is in a really good balanced position

to<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.100> able<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.490> fully<00:01:56.759> back<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> go

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to be able to go fully back and to go

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
whenever the wherever the ball is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.670 
whenever the wherever the ball is
pitched<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> add<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
I think is what great patience
especially<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> comes<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.950> early<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.730> in
