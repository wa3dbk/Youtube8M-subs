 [Music] 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 contrary to what many people think 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 air suspension has not been developed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.039
 now along with the drone fever 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.800
 it was created at the beginning of the century 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 past in the 1940s was 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 nascar racing cars in the 50's 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 became an optional item of the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.800
 automakers and today it is no longer a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 little functional to provide a lot of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 fun

 the air or pneumatic suspension 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.409
 replace the original car springs 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.390
 for bags of arc and enter or empty 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.420
 with the help of an air cylinder 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.729
 compressed to give greater speed to the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.510
 movement of lowering and raising the car 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.129
 can use the nitrogen cylinder 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 a cylinder which is used to 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.710
 stores so much to understand then if you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.110
 have the nitrogen you can use in the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 used suspension was often 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 seeing here marcelo your car dance and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 coral dance I dance it shows how 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.530
 what does he dance to and a control can 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.530
 someone's day game but it does not come out

 also known as a body shop outside the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.399
 Brazil suspension system for air 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.130
 the trucks requires greater preparation 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.380
 sometimes it is necessary to rebuild the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.390
 chassis for the body drag on the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.950
 ground and give the expected effect 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.789
 to what extent does it become

 she leaned down on the floor to do 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.170
 a proof that will show now I'm going 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.090
 put a little paper here under the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.259
 car and it will lower suspension going 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.259
 be safe you can lower it 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:15.050
 actually the leaf globe does not lower and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.000
 lift gives sustenance air became 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.410
 popular in car culture 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.440
 customized 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.510
 but whatever the old and new 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.750
 to have this style is not the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:34.250
 comfort or maneuverability but the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:36.110
 aesthetic either this tribe of demoted 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:53.330
 But now it 's my turn to enjoy. 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:57.280
 also stroll to the top is more
