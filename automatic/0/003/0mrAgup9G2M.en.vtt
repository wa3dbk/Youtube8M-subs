00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the two slashes so that you can get an

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.510 
the two slashes so that you can get an
idea<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.500> did<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.190> were<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
idea of what we just did if you were to

idea of what we just did if you were to
call<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.850> quits<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.510> test<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.960> in

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
call it quits here and test this out in

call it quits here and test this out in
minecraft<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> see<00:00:47.610> by

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
minecraft this is what you see by

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000 
minecraft this is what you see by
default<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.690> shadows<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.200> indeed<00:00:49.500> softer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
default the shadows are indeed softer

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.590 
default the shadows are indeed softer
but<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.489> my<00:00:50.610> personal<00:00:51.000> preference<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
but for my personal preference this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.389 
but for my personal preference this
amount<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> softness<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.920> too<00:00:52.980> much

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
amount of softness is just way too much

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.970 
amount of softness is just way too much
and<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.270> doesn't<00:00:54.539> look<00:00:54.629> very<00:00:54.840> realistic<00:00:55.230> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and it doesn't look very realistic so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
and it doesn't look very realistic so
let's<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> adjust<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.969> blur<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
let's go back and adjust the blur of the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.560 
let's go back and adjust the blur of the
shadows<00:00:57.660> directly<00:00:58.850> scroll<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.300> until

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
shadows directly scroll down a bit until

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.369 
shadows directly scroll down a bit until
you've<00:01:00.660> located<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.170> line<00:01:01.460> 822<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:04.019> value

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you've located a line 822 the value

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
you've located a line 822 the value
directly<00:01:04.559> hit<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> float<00:01:05.280> speed<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
directly hit a float speed is going to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
directly hit a float speed is going to
dictate<00:01:06.479> our<00:01:06.840> shadow<00:01:07.140> map<00:01:07.439> resolution<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
dictate our shadow map resolution so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
dictate our shadow map resolution so
let's<00:01:08.880> mess<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> number<00:01:09.630> change<00:01:10.229> one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
let's mess with the number change one

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330 
let's mess with the number change one
point<00:01:10.770> zero<00:01:10.860> F<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.960> 0.09<00:01:12.960> F<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:14.010> those<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
point zero F to 0.09 F for those of you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
point zero F to 0.09 F for those of you
who<00:01:14.490> would<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> further<00:01:15.030> test<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.479> some

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
who would like to further test out some

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.450 
who would like to further test out some
different<00:01:16.049> numbers<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.979> remember<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
different numbers just remember this

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880 
different numbers just remember this
advice<00:01:17.840> lower<00:01:18.840> numbers<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.409> make<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.710> end

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
advice lower numbers will make your end

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.740 
advice lower numbers will make your end
result<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.369> blurry<00:01:20.700> while<00:01:21.210> higher<00:01:21.420> numbers

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
result more blurry while higher numbers

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200 
result more blurry while higher numbers
will<00:01:21.900> make<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> shadows<00:01:22.500> sharper<00:01:23.070> save<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
will make the shadows sharper save and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.740 
will make the shadows sharper save and
let's<00:01:24.330> check<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.659> out<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.930> minecraft<00:01:26.750> when

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
let's check this out in minecraft when

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
let's check this out in minecraft when
you<00:01:27.840> check<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> shade<00:01:28.350> routing<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:28.920> you'll

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you check the shade routing game you'll

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
you check the shade routing game you'll
see<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> shadows<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.299> quite

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
see that the shadows are actually quite

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080 
see that the shadows are actually quite
similar<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.350> they<00:01:31.530> were<00:01:31.590> originally<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.970> if

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
similar how they were originally but if

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.460 
similar how they were originally but if
you<00:01:33.150> look<00:01:33.299> closely<00:01:33.570> you'll<00:01:33.960> find<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you look closely you'll find that the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.569 
you look closely you'll find that the
shadows<00:01:34.799> now<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.159> more<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> natural

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
shadows now have more of a natural

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
shadows now have more of a natural
Gaussian<00:01:36.540> blur<00:01:36.780> type<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.259> finish<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> the
