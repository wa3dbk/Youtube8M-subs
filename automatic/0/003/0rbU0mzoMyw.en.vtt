00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
previously I think the the most

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
previously I think the the most
interesting<00:01:09.390> thing<00:01:09.570> about<00:01:09.600> halo<00:01:09.930> 4<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
interesting thing about halo 4 is it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.840 
interesting thing about halo 4 is it
comes<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> new<00:01:10.890> developer<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> not

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
comes from a new developer so it's not

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
comes from a new developer so it's not
from<00:01:12.180> Bungie<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> know<00:01:12.900> Bungie<00:01:13.229> had<00:01:13.350> done

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
always believed in is that games need to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.810 
always believed in is that games need to
become<00:03:14.380> even<00:03:14.620> more<00:03:14.650> mainstream<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.520> mean<00:03:15.670> guys
