okay today what we're going to talk
about<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.419> CV<00:00:04.020> joints<00:00:04.470> carry<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:05.100> with<00:00:05.250> our

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
about is CV joints carry on with our

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.980 
about is CV joints carry on with our
series<00:00:05.609> here<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:07.099> I'm<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.400> show<00:00:08.580> you

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
series here and I'm going to show you

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.780 
series here and I'm going to show you
basically<00:00:09.990> your<00:00:10.800> CV<00:00:11.190> joint<00:00:13.370> just<00:00:14.370> fit<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.639> on

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
basically your CV joint just fit it on

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.170 
basically your CV joint just fit it on
here<00:00:15.059> okay<00:00:15.630> CV<00:00:16.440> join<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.859> comes<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
here okay CV join that comes on the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.689 
here okay CV join that comes on the
shaft<00:00:18.630> if<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> there's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
shaft if you can do that with it there's

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.910 
shaft if you can do that with it there's
something<00:00:20.939> wrong<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
something wrong with it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
something wrong with it
this<00:00:22.920> has<00:00:23.160> no<00:00:23.369> balls<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:25.050> you've<00:00:25.439> lost

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
this has no balls in it if you've lost

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.230 
this has no balls in it if you've lost
Drive<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.340> maybe<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.939> would<00:00:27.119> have

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
Drive then maybe this would have

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.179 
Drive then maybe this would have
collapsed

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
collapsed

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.740 
collapsed
however<00:00:29.189> I've<00:00:29.400> stripped<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.539> for

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
however I've stripped this out just for

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
however I've stripped this out just for
demonstration<00:00:31.439> purposes<00:00:33.290> okay<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.890> removing

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
demonstration purposes okay so removing

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
demonstration purposes okay so removing
the<00:00:36.030> CV<00:00:36.420> joint<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.860> best<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the CV joint the best thing to do is to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
the CV joint the best thing to do is to
if<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> keep<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> CV<00:00:40.980> joint<00:00:41.250> if

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
if you're going to keep the CV joint if

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
if you're going to keep the CV joint if
it's<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.610> good<00:00:41.730> condition<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.300> use<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> copper

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
it's in good condition is use a copper

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.190 
it's in good condition is use a copper
mallet<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.579> giving<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.629> couple

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
mallet and it's just giving it a couple

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.540 
mallet and it's just giving it a couple
of<00:00:46.350> whacks<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.860> should<00:00:47.100> slip<00:00:47.370> off

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of whacks and that should slip off

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
of whacks and that should slip off
easily<00:00:48.030> unless<00:00:48.210> somebody's<00:00:48.750> budged<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> on

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
easily unless somebody's budged it on

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.340 
easily unless somebody's budged it on
them<00:00:50.120> like<00:00:51.120> that

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.889 

in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.949> end<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> shaft<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
in the end of the shaft do you have a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.579 
in the end of the shaft do you have a
slot<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> snap<00:01:02.609> ring<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.589> it's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
slot this has a snap ring in it it's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.780 
slot this has a snap ring in it it's
easy<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.100> move<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:06.090> possibly<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> screwdriver

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
easy to move with possibly a screwdriver

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
easy to move with possibly a screwdriver
alright<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> collar<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
also a spacer so when you put your new

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.560 
also a spacer so when you put your new
CV<00:01:16.200> joint<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
CV joint on

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
CV joint on
you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> new<00:01:19.020> snap<00:01:19.320> ring<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.830> make<00:01:20.759> sure

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you have a new snap ring and make sure

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
you have a new snap ring and make sure
your<00:01:21.090> collars<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:25.520> CV<00:01:26.520> joint<00:01:26.820> itself<00:01:27.979> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
your collars the CV joint itself is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
your collars the CV joint itself is
lubricated<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.939> CV<00:01:30.420> joint<00:01:30.810> grease<00:01:31.229> I'll

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
lubricated with CV joint grease I'll

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.469 
lubricated with CV joint grease I'll
show<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> how<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> minute<00:01:33.180> but

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
show you how to do that in a minute but

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.010 
show you how to do that in a minute but
first<00:01:33.689> I'm<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> fit<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.470> dry<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
first I'm going to fit this dry the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
first I'm going to fit this dry the
reason<00:01:37.320> I'm<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> fit<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.009> dry<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
reason I'm going to fit this dry is to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
reason I'm going to fit this dry is to
make<00:01:38.939> sure<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.540> splines<00:01:40.430> matchup

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
make sure that my splines matchup

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.510 
make sure that my splines matchup
because<00:01:41.670> CV<00:01:42.390> joints<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.979> come<00:01:44.369> in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
because CV joints actually can come in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.630 
because CV joints actually can come in
different<00:01:44.670> spline<00:01:45.799> amounts<00:01:46.799> you've<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
different spline amounts you've got to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
different spline amounts you've got to
make<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.600> fit<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.649> also

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
make sure that it will fit it's also

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
make sure that it will fit it's also
wise<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> make<00:01:50.579> sure<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> component<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
wise to make sure that the component is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.160 
wise to make sure that the component is
okay<00:01:52.350> before<00:01:52.799> greasing<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.990> other

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
okay before greasing it up the other

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
okay before greasing it up the other
thing<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> make<00:01:56.790> sure

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
thing I want to do is just to make sure

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
thing I want to do is just to make sure
that<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> movement<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that the movement is all right on the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.569 
that the movement is all right on the
half<00:01:59.130> shaft<00:02:00.049> if<00:02:01.049> I'm<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.680> using<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> CV

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
half shaft if I'm going to be using a CV

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.789 
half shaft if I'm going to be using a CV
joint<00:02:02.850> again<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.990> same<00:02:04.229> thing<00:02:04.439> applies

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
joint again then the same thing applies

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
joint again then the same thing applies
is<00:02:05.100> checking<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> movement<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.270> seeing<00:02:06.899> how

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
is checking the movement and seeing how

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.559 
is checking the movement and seeing how
much<00:02:07.259> slack<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.099> actually<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> CV<00:02:09.239> joint

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
much slack is actually in the CV joint

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.600 
much slack is actually in the CV joint
how<00:02:09.780> much<00:02:09.929> where<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.830> grabbing

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
how much where there is there grabbing

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.130 
how much where there is there grabbing
hold<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.239> twisting<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
hold of it and twisting it on the

hold of it and twisting it on the
splines

in<00:02:17.920> very<00:02:18.099> good<00:02:18.310> conditions<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.930> will

be used again so basically what I'm
doing<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.989> just<00:02:23.050> grabbing<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.830> checking

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
well have a problem because this needs

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.480 
well have a problem because this needs
to<00:05:14.460> be<00:05:14.550> squeezed<00:05:15.030> up<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.360> bit<00:05:16.280> so<00:05:17.280> what<00:05:17.460> do<00:05:19.490> is

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
to be squeezed up a bit so what do is

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.630 
to be squeezed up a bit so what do is
I'll<00:05:20.700> get<00:05:20.790> a<00:05:20.850> pair<00:05:21.090> of<00:05:21.120> pliers<00:05:21.330> here<00:05:22.640> I'll

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
I'll get a pair of pliers here I'll

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.360 
I'll get a pair of pliers here I'll
squeeze<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.240> then<00:05:24.510> knock<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.870> on<00:05:25.250> what<00:05:26.250> it

into<00:05:32.340> place<00:05:32.670> so<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.420> will<00:05:33.660> go<00:05:33.780> easily<00:05:35.450> so<00:05:36.450> if

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
into place so it will go easily so if

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.090 
into place so it will go easily so if
you<00:05:36.720> just<00:05:36.930> miss<00:05:37.170> that<00:05:37.200> it's<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.770> matter<00:05:37.980> of

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
squeezing this up hang on we'll get it

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.600 
squeezing this up hang on we'll get it
just<00:05:40.920> right<00:05:41.040> some<00:05:41.610> people<00:05:41.640> use<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.030> cable<00:05:42.330> tight

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610

squeezed up I'm now going to zoom out
the<00:05:54.390> camera<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.100> I'm<00:05:56.100> holding<00:05:56.520> that<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:57.060> it's

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
the camera and I'm holding that so it's

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.720 
the camera and I'm holding that so it's
in<00:05:57.690> place<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.200> whack<00:05:58.500> straight<00:05:58.980> that<00:05:59.280> goes<00:05:59.490> on

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
in place and whack straight that goes on

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.320 
in place and whack straight that goes on
so<00:05:59.940> it's<00:06:00.750> as<00:06:00.840> easy<00:06:00.990> as<00:06:01.200> that<00:06:02.030> CV<00:06:03.030> joint

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
so it's as easy as that CV joint

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330 
so it's as easy as that CV joint
