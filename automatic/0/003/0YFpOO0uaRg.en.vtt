00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.340
 presenting you an interesting 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:19.610
 development of the company to fighters allowing 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 connect the reverse gear to the engine 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:30.019
 air cooled kit consists 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.019
 in two parts this is such a carter 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:42.140
 who joins the gearbox here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 such a coupling that allows 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:55.040
 from the slotted primary rail shaft and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:08.100
 doctors go to the cylindrical shaft 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 engine kit also includes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.650
 fastener kit to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.640
 demonstrate how to fasten and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 With this system we took our 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.320
 the widow shred took off his belt 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 gear 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.360
 removed the pulley and now show how it all 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 joins if your diesel 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 the motor has an output shaft 25 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.850
 millimeters and has such here 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.159
 connecting holes with 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:50.310
 centering belt then you can easily 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:54.150
 attach the ship gearbox with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.979
 this transition kit order 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.650
 assembly 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:05.150
 this set the following put on 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.150
 dad reverse gear from the top 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.320
 attach the crankcase to the outside 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.380
 given kontra 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.630
 The transitional has four holes in 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:33.560
 which fixing bolts are inserted 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:37.180
 included in the kit are also two 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:43.100
 mounting holes are located inside 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:48.080
 give them two bolts for 6 gran 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.070
 we tightened the mounting bolts and now 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.010
 we put the clutch in order to clutch 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:05.720
 it was easier to put on the shaft a little bit 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 unclenched it using a mu screwdriver 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.320
 set all the way 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.920
 then we tighten the two bolts under 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 hexagon 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:37.830
 and bait gearbox we fix 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.130
 adapter with bolts that go 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.130
 in set 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:53.349
 all bolts tightened centering belt 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:58.349
 sat on a special 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:05.170
 flow centering casting 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:07.930
 centering and not counting the wheels on 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.989
 which installed garden shredder 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.159
 we got a full ship 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:18.190
 engine with reverse gear 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:22.630
 installation is quite compact and can 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.039
 be as diesel as gasoline only 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:32.830
 lever position 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:35.710
 we are in neutral turning 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.160
 lever from the engine we get the front 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.770
 engine running back now we 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.770
 let's start the engine and show how it works 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.170
 here 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.100
 water 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.009
 here 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.350
 he 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.560
 tube it 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.560
 So 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.210
 by which 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.169
 1 record 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.270
 stolen 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.360
 is it time 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.229
 discover 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.710
 learn this kit 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.710
