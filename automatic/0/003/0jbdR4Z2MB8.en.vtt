00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.470
 psv plays in the play-offs of the europe 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.140
 league against the austrian sv ried 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 nevertheless, the draw today determined 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.980
 first plays on Thursday, August 18 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 at home a week later the return is in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.910
 Austria and fraud is for 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 trainer fred rutten of psv 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.430
 a completely unknown opposition from 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.340
 girl totally unknown i only have the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.519
 information that they ended 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.380
 the past we are your brumby yes 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.960
 come through 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.829
 well that is one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.260
 there is good performance but as soon as schmitz 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.879
 well-known serious approach to cup winner 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 they stand from austria celebrate place 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.160
 I understand the moment after 5 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.570
 matches 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.940
 yes yes that makes sense to you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.510
 competition and if we can, we can 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.160
 see it twice so if possible 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 I would just fly over like that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.180
 is possible 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 to a challenge coach the work 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 is deployed on a very accessible basis 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.949
 800 kilometers away who 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 I thought so 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.049
 it is for us that the ideal is you 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 have little travel time and he himself 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 with the match that the channel goes again 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 come that nice Jan 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.920
 a longer dress should not be a problem 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.299
 its sv ried yes look i am psv see club 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.380
 that has a decent reputation in 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.479
 Europe reached quarterfinal last year and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 yes if you are the kind of put together 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 yes then you have to watch out for 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.000
 underestimation of looking ahead 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 to the double confrontation with it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.720
 we now use austrian reed with fred 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.290
 rutten talk about the opening of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.619
 League 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.869
 Sunday afternoon half past twelve in Alkmaar az 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.119
 Fred Rutten spoke extensively this afternoon 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.369
 of course with journalists too 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.869
 you look at how he looks at az 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.299
 wants to make a good start and that good one 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.020
 start is always if you can go there now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.520
 go and you can grab 3 points there and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.050
 that then we should think a bit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.000
 strive and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.220
 sea ​​view and already in the competition 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 which was a number of sl were drums 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.490
 played that ring might be one 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.810
 little in their favor 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.990
 on the other hand have a journey in the legs 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.850
 and will also have time for us 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.700
 I think we're ready 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.690
 Be ready to get a good score there 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.340
 to put down 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.050
 are you fresher on Sunday afternoon? 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.250
 parties like you from az this past week 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.010
 in that with that match 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.130
 Thursday with that journey afterwards yes behind 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.670
 is all in the head and look over it 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.800
 thinking 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.160
 look here it is the start of their van 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.410
 commission to that city that I bother 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.940
 mine you from wolves with about five six 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.890
 then you can see if you can see if there 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.959
 good condition 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.640
 this is a website and we are going to have it 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.240
 learn from winning and then goes will too 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.520
 For all I know it in me a gertjan 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.430
 and I can verbeek very well so I 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 think he is both physically and mentally 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 ready to do what to do 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.180
 how it would be there the first 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.500
 1000 he win we we have at it 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.860
 start of this new football competition 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.050
 always of those somewhat clichéd questions 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.850
 space further ready for the start i look 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.950
 am ready for rheumatism anyway 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.500
 and also to the players who want it 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.299
 very happy that the beginning can be coincidence 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.200
 coincidentally heard this morning with hooves 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.150
 their play and that through always takes the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.410
 you know how to prepare for too long in the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.350
 the experience of a football player was a chalet 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.790
 for when it goes and that's it 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.190
 final 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.780
 then the ultimate does not matter 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.130
 preparation football but in the sense of 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.510
 a ready to be had 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.830
 of course prefer that defender and that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.310
 rush hour goes here or as you like 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.080
 to have 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.000
 pity invite who we sour woe 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.530
 how to deal with when we are concerned 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.730
 pragmatic 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.010
 we have this which is currently the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.780
 disposal and I will be the best team 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.920
 draw up 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.010
 certainly 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.930
 from half past one that it made me high day 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.819
 could have had the best result on the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.950
 best result that is if you can 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.480
 inside and those 11 names that you go now 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.800
 tell you don't tell and that 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.800
 you also for myself
