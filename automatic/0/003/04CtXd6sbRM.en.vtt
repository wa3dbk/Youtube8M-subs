00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi everybody today I want to make a video 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.690
 about cold porcelain from that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.360
 the moment I shot my videos passed 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 more than eight months and a lot in my 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.859
 the recipe has changed I began to do 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.779
 lighter some of the ingredients i replaced 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.039
 absolutely and make an announcement for release 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.380
 your brand new recipe let's say 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.020
 so it will not be cold china 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.620
 it will be a polymer clay it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 completely different in properties will be here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.020
 such here if everything works out 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 new recipe here is such a polymer ki it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010
 absolutely dried petal and we are more 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.309
 five days 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 what prompted me to do 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:00.300
 completely elastic cold porcelain 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 let's call him so here is my gerbera 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 she fell with the vase she filed 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 the first 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.790
 she and here's a rose and regardless of her 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.170
 high plasticity of the petals here they are 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.970
 there are still more than two months 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.979
 she still broke but it 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.439
 due to the fact that the starch which we 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.869
 We use it is fragile and I was stuck on 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.850
 on trash that part of starch is starch 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 act as a thickener and such here 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.110
 these rays I got namely raw cold 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.439
 china so that it is convenient to work with him 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:46.200
 onto part of another thickener so he 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:49.470
 was more plastic after drying well 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.079
 This is an announcement this while I did not do before 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.079
 in a month I will not show you anything 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:01.409
 I want to understand whether there will be flowers in my 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.509
 from this new plastic we will call 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.899
 also polymer clay is the same 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.970
 elastic expiration month or 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:14.129
 all the same 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:17.489
 this property will be lost while it is but 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.099
 I'll tell you that I'm in the cold 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.709
 porcelain changed to become such 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.340
 perfect elastic yet per month 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.340
 will wait 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.430
 This is the first thing I changed in the first place. 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.519
 pulp i naturally no longer so 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.110
 Wise I wrote it in annotations I 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:43.620
 I take here the medical film 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:48.180
 here so I cut and get out 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.040
 loose pulp here it is please 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:58.319
 Ready Thank you, Anya prompted 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.840
 so second I add pulp to 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.630
 smaller quantity than i showed 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.410
 to avoid this dry effect 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.959
 as so as dried up and add 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.200
 right away i mean i cook with pulp then 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.180
 there is dissolving it in glue 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.690
 well then add starch vanity 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.670
 I stood for 10 minutes and cook 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:27.180
 instead of candles candles remember when I was at 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.340
 we waxed I sat on the forum fi and 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.079
 chemists and found out that stearin is better 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.480
 can and paraffin bottom stearin better 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.420
 so I buy stearine now 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.120
 candles stearin candle is a mixture 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.160
 paraffin and stearin stearic acid 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.579
 called steven then stearic 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.940
 acid is better yes checked and paraffin i 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.280
 added then stearin and everything is fine not 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.170
 cracking increases ductility 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.920
 significantly increased to more then 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.690
 plasticizer which we have in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.489
 glue 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.209
 glue by the way using now is not easy 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.380
 glue or wood glue when there is a 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.169
 Mostly have a feast I use dispersion according to 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.320
 plasticized which are 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.650
 plasticizers 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.500
 esters it or depu 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.600
 be and tired of iso butyl become fret you 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.699
 Understood this is a reduction can still 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.889
 be that is when you choose 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.389
 dispersion look there db 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.880
 this here it is dbf here such here and 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.780
 check with the seller what it is 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.979
 designate why this plasticizer is not 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.930
 plasticizer plus plasticized 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.440
 dispersion i always add rubber 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.270
 gotama oil 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.990
 this is our natural plasticizer 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.590
 Castorca is sold in the pharmacy at 6 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:03.199
 tablespoons defense I drive floor dining 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:09.750
 spoons of rubber oil and glycerin 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:12.389
 half tablespoons too and candles and i 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.229
 also half tablespoon true stearin 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.530
 stearin, paraffin and that's all that 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:23.039
 I wanted to clarify on cold china 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:25.770
 from the new that is in that old recipe i 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.520
 now do new i'm a wizard they i 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.710
 drew 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.650
 and made the announcement of its new recipe 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.909
 wait for him to sign up for 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.909
 channel all bye
