00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 what's up but I'm not wing haven and if not 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.109
 I'm dead I'm alive and I bring you the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.849
 second chapter of jumping by 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 butterfield 4 that the first liked 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.360
 quite and I hope you like it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 equal or even more than the first so 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 let's start and to begin with we have a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
 I jump pretty cool on the map of favor 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 and we are here in the pipes of the middle 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 and for this we have to go up to this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 pipe with this ramp since there are 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 here and then we do not have this container 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 taking a little run and now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.349
 true here because we break the window by 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 which we want to enter good as 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 You see all broken laser and we'll go in 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.570
 for being the medium so we have 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.129
 lanes now and we hit the button 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.469
 jump and as you can see it makes us the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.540
 animation and we are here within the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 df flag and we can capture the flag 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
 or copy in the back the people who 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.880
 it's in tunnel so it's the first jump 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.010
 and we are going to the second 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.360
 and we move towards golmud train 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.160
 in the most peculiar part that by 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.230
 course they are the roofs where 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.260
 we will jump from this roof to this other and 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.700
 vice versa in a fairly simple way 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.740
 I think a jump that many people know 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.470
 but still he deserved a place in this 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.910
 episode and to do it is very simple 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.010
 all you have to do is catch 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.140
 a little run and jump like 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.360
 it is very very easy on a par 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.400
 what useful and instead to do it at 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.380
 reverse is a bit more difficult since 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.690
 if you try to do the same, the only thing that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.330
 will get is to hit you against this and 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.740
 assault then you fall down this 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.350
 it is for it both on the left side 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.150
 as the right the one who prefers jce us 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.310
 we put a little diagonally we jump 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.410
 here and then we make another small 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.840
 jump and we're already on the other roof 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.150
 as you see is very very simple is something 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.490
 pretty useful so everything to sneak away 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.990
 just that it's from the enemies so 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.939
 we go to the next 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.380
 and we do not move from golmud train 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.210
 because I'm going to show you how sori 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 roof of the house small street in bravo 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.350
 there are two ways and both are very 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.570
 simple the first is to get on this 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 house here we jump to the blue contario 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.729
 from here to the roof and from here because 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.439
 We jump to the roof as it is very 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.330
 simple from a pretty useful position 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.159
 where where we see practically all the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.740
 map and to do it from the other 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.330
 position we have to come here and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.880
 we come to these boxes here we 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.000
 we climb to the rock diagonally 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.160
 we went up to the wall this one could say 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.380
 and from here, we got on 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.420
 to the roof this as you see the two ways 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.180
 they are very simple and they are quite fast 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.549
 from this position is very useful where where 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 we can do get click that means 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.470
 only give us the head and also 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 we can have control of practically 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.660
 34 of the map so we turn towards 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.880
 the next and finally I bring you a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.709
 jump not cool but ultra cool in typhoon 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.049
 of paracelsus a jump that used 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.180
 quite competitive if we are in the 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.730
 charly flag and we come towards 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.569
 here we jump we make a triple the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.840
 basket 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.999
 we got on top and once we're 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.609
 up here we jump where you see the boat 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.329
 kim and as you see this position is very 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.629
 monkey 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.459
 it's a position that I like a lot and 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.099
 as you see we can control 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.040
 practically three quarters of the map 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.439
 both in tcm of death by teams 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.599
 as in domination and above all we have 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.459
 best angle to kill those who are 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.310
 inside the houses that as you know 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.749
 In the vate field, the camper is the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.459
 from here, you think you do not have a 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.469
 extra point of advantage to kill the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.269
 they are changing houses and nothing 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.480
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.239
 video and from here I promise you that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.919
 I will try not to be so irregular with the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.319
 upload of the videos and we will try 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.930
 bring us some the odd video 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.389
 weekly I will commit myself to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.310
 public way to press him a little 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.689
 so grada on my part nothing more than 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.639
 add I hope you liked the 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.660
 video and see you in another made people 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.820
 see you later 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.100
 and leave some comment on this pussy 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.120
 roof to the other is very simple the only thing 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.110
 what you have to do is exhale 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.970
 run and good wing yes 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.970
 very good how good I am
