00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.370 
smooth and all we have to do is blow out
and<00:01:03.750> style<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> top<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> first<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> use

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and style the top so first I like to use

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:22.630 
and style the top so first I like to use
a<00:01:07.409> foam

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.400 

and<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.760> brush<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> very<00:01:24.180> good<00:01:24.870> with<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
and the brush is very good with this

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.550 
and the brush is very good with this
hair<00:01:25.590> type<00:01:26.240> because<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:28.080> lays<00:01:28.260> down

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
hair type because that really lays down

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.150 
hair type because that really lays down
the<00:01:28.980> hair<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> good<00:01:31.050> thing<00:01:31.260> about<00:01:31.380> fine

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
the hair so the good thing about fine

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.800 
the hair so the good thing about fine
hair<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:35.760> can<00:01:35.910> mold<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.300> really

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
hair is that it's you can mold it really

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.090 
hair is that it's you can mold it really
easy<00:01:37.910> when<00:01:38.910> it's<00:01:39.119> wet<00:01:39.300> so<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.010> get

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
easy when it's wet so you want to get

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:51.460 
easy when it's wet so you want to get
the<00:01:41.190> hair<00:01:41.340> nice<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.970> wet

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.740 

now<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.760> a<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:53.090> important<00:01:53.540> step

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
now this is a very important step

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.740 
now this is a very important step
because<00:01:54.400> how<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.460> hair<00:01:55.820> dries<00:01:56.150> that's<00:01:56.630> how

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
because how the hair dries that's how

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.840 
because how the hair dries that's how
it's<00:01:56.930> gonna<00:01:57.050> stay<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:58.100> want<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.400> make<00:01:58.580> sure

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it's gonna stay so you want to make sure

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.570 
it's gonna stay so you want to make sure
that<00:01:59.120> you<00:01:59.330> get<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.540> nice<00:02:00.010> mould<00:02:01.010> on<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> sides

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
that you get a nice mould on the sides

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:17.730 
that you get a nice mould on the sides
here<00:02:02.830> very<00:02:03.830> very<00:02:04.070> important

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.250 

and<00:02:18.740> once<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.070> do<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:20.600> want<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> lock<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and once you do that you want to lock it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.580 
and once you do that you want to lock it
into<00:02:21.380> place<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.870> best<00:02:24.020> way<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.470> that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
into place and the best way to do that

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:36.059 
into place and the best way to do that
is<00:02:24.800> with<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:26.770> sanic<00:02:27.770> strip

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.140 

and<00:02:37.069> at<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.370> point<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.760> don't<00:02:37.790> need<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
and at this point you don't need to

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.309 
and at this point you don't need to
worry<00:02:38.360> about<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.690> top<00:02:38.870> because<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:39.170> gonna

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
worry about the top because I'm gonna

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.100 
worry about the top because I'm gonna
blow<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.620> with<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> blow-dryer<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.900> take

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
blow that with a blow-dryer you take

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.000 
blow that with a blow-dryer you take
your<00:02:45.230> clip

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.210 

make<00:02:51.489> sure<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.849> in<00:02:51.910> place<00:02:52.920> put<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> client

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
make sure it's in place put the client

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.759 
make sure it's in place put the client
under<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:55.000> dryer<00:02:55.269> for<00:02:55.300> at<00:02:55.690> least<00:02:55.870> 30<00:02:56.530> minutes

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
under the dryer for at least 30 minutes

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.720 
under the dryer for at least 30 minutes
or<00:02:57.069> until<00:02:57.099> it's<00:02:57.550> completely<00:02:57.970> dry<00:02:59.459> then<00:03:00.459> go<00:03:00.670> to

or until it's completely dry then go to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.580 
or until it's completely dry then go to
the<00:03:00.910> next<00:03:01.150> step<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:01.599> now<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.319> her

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the next step so now that I have her

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.619
