from<00:00:30.779> bloating<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.610> forms<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.480> allergies

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
from bloating to all forms of allergies

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.160 
from bloating to all forms of allergies
more<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:34.860> people<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.579> off<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
more and more people are going off of it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
more and more people are going off of it
there<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.530> better<00:00:38.180> varieties<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> wheat

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
there are some better varieties of wheat

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.310 
there are some better varieties of wheat
like<00:00:39.960> spelt<00:00:40.700> it's<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.059> example<00:00:42.320> but

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
like spelt it's just one example but

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.619 
like spelt it's just one example but
it's<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.219> our<00:00:44.399> main<00:00:44.550> diet<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.120> mean<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.420> hard

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it's it's our main diet I mean it's hard

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.540 
it's it's our main diet I mean it's hard
to<00:00:45.809> grab<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> quick<00:00:46.680> piece<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.129> food<00:00:47.280> without

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to grab a quick piece of food without

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.979 
to grab a quick piece of food without
having<00:00:47.969> wheat<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.930> there<00:00:51.930> are

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
having wheat in it you know so there are

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.500 
having wheat in it you know so there are
in<00:00:52.140> fact<00:00:52.320> still<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.980> lot<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> different<00:00:54.300> types

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
in fact still a lot of different types

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.540 
in fact still a lot of different types
of<00:00:54.660> flours<00:00:55.020> around<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.190> probably<00:00:56.340> have

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
of flours around but you probably have

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
of flours around but you probably have
to<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.090> Indian<00:00:57.539> shop<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.079> 40<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:58.710> 50

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to like an Indian shop you see 40 or 50

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.299 
to like an Indian shop you see 40 or 50
types<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.760> flours<00:01:00.710> they're<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.100> made

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

types of flours they're not all made
from<00:01:02.550> wheat<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.870> spelt<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
from wheat on you but spelt is it is a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.320 
from wheat on you but spelt is it is a
good<00:01:05.100> form<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.460> wheat<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.450> expensive

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
good form of wheat and more expensive

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
good form of wheat and more expensive
we're<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.450> even<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.840> sure<00:01:10.049> what's<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> our

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
we're not even really sure what's in our

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.700 
we're not even really sure what's in our
wheats<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> mean<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.350> few<00:01:13.350> years<00:01:13.590> ago

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
wheats you know I mean a few years ago

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
wheats you know I mean a few years ago
in<00:01:13.890> Britain<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.400> were<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.729> were<00:01:14.790> massive

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
in Britain there were there were massive

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
in Britain there were there were massive
floods<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> wheat<00:01:16.290> harvest<00:01:16.710> got

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
floods and of the wheat harvest got

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490 
floods and of the wheat harvest got
ruined<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.450> damaged<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.380> had<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
ruined and damaged I think they had to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
ruined and damaged I think they had to
harvested<00:01:19.979> early<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> government

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
harvested early in and so the government

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
harvested early in and so the government
responded<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.259> saying<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.400> put

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
responded by saying I will just put

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
responded by saying I will just put
additives<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> wheat<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
additives in in the wheat you know like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.630 
additives in in the wheat you know like
like<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.930> animal<00:01:27.930> feed<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:29.159> example

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like you do with animal feed for example

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850 
like you do with animal feed for example
and<00:01:29.820> who<00:01:30.000> knows<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.140> ground<00:01:31.409> powder

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and who knows what is just ground powder

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.990 
and who knows what is just ground powder
who<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.670> knows<00:01:32.939> what's<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.850> any

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
who really knows what's in it but in any

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.539 
who really knows what's in it but in any
event<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.549> nourishing

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
event I don't think it's as nourishing

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
event I don't think it's as nourishing
as<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> should<00:01:39.119> be<00:01:39.770> rice<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> nice

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
as it should be rice is a nice

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
as it should be rice is a nice
alternative<00:01:42.229> there<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.290> quite<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> few

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.210 
alternative there are quite a few
varieties<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> rice<00:01:45.290> but<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
varieties of rice but it's a bit of a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.330

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
know you're gonna keep adding water and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
know you're gonna keep adding water and
getting<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> keep<00:01:52.590> watching<00:01:52.740> it
