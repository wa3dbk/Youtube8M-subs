00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
strip of board here that's 8 foot 6

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.099 
strip of board here that's 8 foot 6
inches<00:00:18.420> long<00:00:19.100> one<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> top<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.080> one<00:00:22.080> on

inches long one on the top and one on
the<00:00:22.320> bottom<00:00:22.470> there<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.990> basically<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.140> we

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the bottom there and basically what we

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.160 
the bottom there and basically what we
do<00:00:25.680> disconnected<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> from<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> rack<00:00:27.840> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
do disconnected it from the rack that

do disconnected it from the rack that
holds<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> cages<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> frame<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> holds

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
holds the cages or the frame that holds

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.110 
holds the cages or the frame that holds
the<00:00:30.869> cages<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.349> moved<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> down<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.759> 5

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the cages and moved it down about 5

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.340 
the cages and moved it down about 5
inches<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.870> also<00:00:34.829> at<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> same<00:00:35.190> time<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
inches and also at the same time we the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.979 
inches and also at the same time we the
old<00:00:37.500> version<00:00:37.890> goes<00:00:38.129> underneath<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.989> board

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
old version goes underneath the board

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.760 
old version goes underneath the board
that<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.200> put<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:41.850> goes<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.030> top

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
that we put in and this one goes on top

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.840 
that we put in and this one goes on top
so<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.399> pulling

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so you see that where it's pulling

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
so you see that where it's pulling
because<00:00:46.520> because<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> weight<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.410> lot<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because because of the weight a lot of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439 
because because of the weight a lot of
flaws<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> old<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.090> we

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
flaws in this old one because what we

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
flaws in this old one because what we
found<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.649> couldn't<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.100> underneath<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
found was we couldn't see underneath the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.020 
found was we couldn't see underneath the
cages<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.829> getting<00:00:56.100> caught<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
cages and what was getting caught in the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
cages and what was getting caught in the
cages<00:00:57.770> again<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.010> couldn't<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.460> was

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
cages again and we couldn't see what was

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
cages again and we couldn't see what was
on<00:01:00.030> top<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:02.489> catch<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> see

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
on top of the catch so now we can see

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.810 
on top of the catch so now we can see
what's<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> catch<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.670> also

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
what's on top of catch and we can also

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
what's on top of catch and we can also
push<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> rake<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.380> clean<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> out

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
push a rake in here and and clean it out

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
push a rake in here and and clean it out
if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> look<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> older<00:01:10.170> ones

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
if you look on some of the older ones

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
if you look on some of the older ones
there<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.790> pretty
