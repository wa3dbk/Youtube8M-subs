00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
probably better if you're sort of a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
probably better if you're sort of a
mechanically<00:00:53.190> minded<00:00:53.399> person<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.090> sort<00:00:54.239> of

look<00:00:55.050> after<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> these<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.699> doesn't<00:00:57.000> have

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
look after one of these it doesn't have

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
look after one of these it doesn't have
indicators<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> they've<00:00:58.379> been<00:00:58.410> removed<00:00:59.070> to

some stage in the past also has known
errors<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> bike<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> paintwork<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
errors on the bike the paintwork on the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.200 
errors on the bike the paintwork on the
bike<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.140> bad<00:01:07.500> although<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
bike is not bad although here if you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000 
bike is not bad although here if you
look<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> proper<00:01:10.740> pitch

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
look in that and then the proper pitch

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.380 
look in that and then the proper pitch
you'll<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.700> stress<00:01:12.030> around<00:01:12.210> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you'll see is a bit stress around this

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.700 
you'll see is a bit stress around this
screw<00:01:12.720> hole<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:15.080> made<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> paintwork

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710

are not good either they really want to
come<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.150> properly<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.810> think

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
come up and be put on properly I think

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
come up and be put on properly I think

along as soon as this left cylinder
wasn't<00:01:50.579> firing<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.360> took<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.750> float<00:01:52.079> ball<00:01:52.320> off

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
wasn't firing I took this float ball off
it's<00:01:52.710> quite<00:01:52.920> scummy<00:01:53.369> inside

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it's quite scummy inside

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.560 
it's quite scummy inside
I<00:01:54.540> gave<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> wipe<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.310> squirted<00:01:56.700> wd-40

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
I gave it a wipe out and squirted wd-40

I gave it a wipe out and squirted wd-40
of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> Jets<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.979> fixed<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of the Jets and that fixed it for a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.210 
of the Jets and that fixed it for a
while<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:01.130> after<00:02:02.130> about<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> mile<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
while but after about a mile or so you

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.280 
while but after about a mile or so you
