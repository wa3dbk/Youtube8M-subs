00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
below middle C and that's the one to up

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.730 
below middle C and that's the one to up
tips<00:00:12.480> below<00:00:12.719> middle<00:00:13.049> C<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.440> that's<00:00:13.500> our

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
tips below middle C and that's our

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.749 
tips below middle C and that's our
starting<00:00:14.250> point

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
starting point

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.550 
starting point
we'll<00:00:15.360> look<00:00:15.420> about<00:00:15.630> five<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.109> six<00:00:16.320> or<00:00:16.529> seven

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
we'll look about five or six or seven

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.040 
we'll look about five or six or seven
different<00:00:17.100> left<00:00:17.640> hand<00:00:17.940> patterns<00:00:18.420> today<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
different left hand patterns today and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
different left hand patterns today and
we'll<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:19.859> hand<00:00:19.890> another<00:00:20.250> time<00:00:20.580> so

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
we'll do the right hand another time so

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.910 
we'll do the right hand another time so
first<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:21.869> we'll<00:00:21.990> start<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.380> simplest

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
first of all we'll start at the simplest

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.640 
first of all we'll start at the simplest
and<00:00:23.250> we'll<00:00:23.640> work<00:00:23.850> up<00:00:24.029> from<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.449> so

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
and we'll work up from there so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.010 
and we'll work up from there so

the movie Train feel obviously the hold

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.220 
the movie Train feel obviously the hold
your<00:00:42.880> fingers<00:00:43.180> like<00:00:43.360> that<00:00:43.390> I'm<00:00:43.870> just<00:00:43.930> doing

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
your fingers like that I'm just doing

00:00:44.230 --> 00:01:03.569 
your fingers like that I'm just doing
that<00:00:44.260> so<00:00:44.500> you<00:00:44.559> can<00:00:44.739> see<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.340> you'd<00:01:03.460> be

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
that so you can see so you'd be

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.550 
that so you can see so you'd be
well-advised<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.089> practice<00:01:04.899> that<00:01:05.080> over<00:01:05.440> and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
well-advised to practice that over and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.900 
well-advised to practice that over and
over<00:01:05.649> till<00:01:05.830> you<00:01:05.890> can<00:01:06.040> get<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.580> chord

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
over till you can get that that chord

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.690 
over till you can get that that chord
structure<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.570> same<00:01:07.840> with<00:01:08.770> all<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
structure is the same with all the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.249 
structure is the same with all the
pounds<00:01:10.360> we're<00:01:10.450> going<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.630> do<00:01:10.720> today<00:01:10.930> right<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
pounds we're going to do today right the

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.950 
pounds we're going to do today right the
next<00:01:11.530> one<00:01:11.680> it's<00:01:12.190> very<00:01:12.670> simple<00:01:13.240> again<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.690> these

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
next one it's very simple again to these

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.240 
next one it's very simple again to these
but<00:01:14.259> this<00:01:14.380> time<00:01:14.560> we<00:01:14.619> do<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.830> middle<00:01:14.950> to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
but this time we do the middle to

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.590 
but this time we do the middle to
another

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:38.930 

outside<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.840> time<00:01:23.080> thing<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:24.430> have<00:01:29.130> goats<00:01:30.130> gee

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.610 

okay<00:01:39.940> now<00:01:40.120> we'll<00:01:40.300> look<00:01:40.390> at<00:01:40.510> some<00:01:40.570> more<00:01:40.780> those

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
okay now we'll look at some more those

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.460 
okay now we'll look at some more those

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
of mmm just take laps practice the next

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.630 
of mmm just take laps practice the next
one<00:01:44.680> I'm<00:01:44.740> going<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> show<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.310> bit<00:01:45.610> more

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
then back to the C so 2 1 1 then we'll

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.460 
then back to the C so 2 1 1 then we'll
just<00:02:00.850> we'll<00:02:00.970> play<00:02:01.120> AC<00:02:01.390> major<00:02:01.600> chord<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.290> E<00:02:02.320> in

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.030 

you<00:02:29.660> got<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.930> work<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.410> one<00:02:30.620> really

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
you got to work on this one really

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.790 
you got to work on this one really
slowly<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.550> build<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.030> bit

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.750 

that's<00:02:37.280> good<00:02:37.520> out<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.880> have

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.800 

so<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:45.780> chord<00:02:46.019> sequence<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.590> same<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
so on the chord sequence is the same and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.809 
so on the chord sequence is the same and
to<00:02:48.810> make<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.170> one<00:02:49.500> step<00:02:49.530> more<00:02:50.040> complex<00:02:50.549> again

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
to make that one step more complex again

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.449 
to make that one step more complex again
as<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.180> do<00:02:51.299> this<00:02:52.909> then<00:02:53.909> rather<00:02:54.120> than<00:02:54.390> going

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
as if you do this then rather than going

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.160 
as if you do this then rather than going
you<00:02:56.459> go

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you go

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:25.120 
you go
so<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.860> get<00:02:59.010> this

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.150 

that<00:03:25.640> said<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:27.170> expect<00:03:27.530> more<00:03:27.620> coordination

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
that said to expect more coordination

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:37.089 
that said to expect more coordination
that<00:03:28.460> one<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.090> we've<00:03:29.240> covered<00:03:30.580> coverage

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.080 

and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090

now the one classic booyah movie riff of
all<00:03:48.319> time<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.950> I'll<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.250> play<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:49.580> real<00:03:49.790> slow

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
all time is I'll just play it real slow

all time is I'll just play it real slow
it's<00:03:50.269> easy<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.900> just<00:03:51.410> needs<00:03:51.650> practice<00:03:51.920> to

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
it's easy but it just needs practice to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:07.220 
it's easy but it just needs practice to
get<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.489> fast<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.599> it's<00:03:53.810> all<00:03:53.959> obvious

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
doing in triplet so you go CC and then

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:26.860 
doing in triplet so you go CC and then
back<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:03.750> C<00:06:03.960> again<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:04.410> citizens

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870
