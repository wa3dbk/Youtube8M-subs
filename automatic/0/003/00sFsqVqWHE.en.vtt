00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.789
 hello how welcome are you to this your channel 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.030
 november orange speaks to them miguel 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:15.769
 Mendoza and today I want to talk about a 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.030
 topic I'm going to read a note on mercury 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.030
 the planet mercury 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.220
 three independent studies conducted 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.980
 with several of the instruments of the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.740
 messenger mission reveal that in the pole 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.349
 north of mercury the most internal of the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.500
 planets of the solar system there is a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.840
 large amount of water ice and a 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.960
 mysterious dark layer of compounds 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.200
 organic the spectacular find 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.300
 just published in science 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.830
 mercury is the planet closest to 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.650
 Sun is in fact only 58 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.380
 million kilometers three times more 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.680
 near the star king that the earth 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.840
 that's why the temperatures reach there 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.440
 really hellish values until the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.560
 450 degrees in its Ecuador despite that 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.229
 the messenger area just nasa 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.490
 provide unequivocal evidence of the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.550
 existence of a large amount of ice 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.190
 on the planet hidden inside of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.619
 deep and dark craters in its pole 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.090
 north an ice that is also covered 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.600
 of organic compounds 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.020
 good what simply relates this 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.880
 note is that the planet closest to 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.840
 sun which is mercury which is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.250
 the planets also smaller 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:47.720
 and is composed of solid rock 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 It is tilted one degree on its own axis 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.289
 and there is a certain area where the 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:00.960
 sun and in that area the messenger probe 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.960
 he caught with his instruments 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.620
 the fact that there is ice there under the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.250
 craters that means there are the 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.660
 temperatures go down quite low 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.910
 let's say let's say it like that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.460
 or 30 below zero is not known yet how 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.800
 but nevertheless 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.360
 if we go to the part where it hits 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.480
 the sun is obviously going to be very 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.410
 hot and here what the Nasa intends 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 when investigating the planet mercury is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.220
 find a small fringe 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.349
 This is what all scientists 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.830
 It makes them think that NASA has invested 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.750
 Too much money 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.600
 to be able to find the mercury if the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 humans we can live there one day 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.580
 clear not on the entire planet but one 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.360
 small strip where where there may be 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.040
 liquid water water in liquid state with 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.040
 some temperatures hovering from 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:19.060
 from 5 degrees centigrade or 0 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.220
 Celsius degrees to 30 35 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.220
 degrees centigrade approximately 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.129
 and if not the messenger mission just just 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.129
 I would have a scientific goal 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.950
 although for what we know it is not reversed 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.390
 so much money but we believe that it has a 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.540
 finish 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.140
 an end for humanity whether it be lived and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.960
 has some facilities 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.540
 on the mercury planet and this expands 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.459
 our world because not only would it be the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.870
 earth inhabited by us the moon 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.670
 Mars 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.670
 a small part of mercury 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.100
 and perhaps some planets beyond 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:16.380
 of the asteroid belt 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.720
 not counting some space stations 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.640
 international 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.900
 and that's it and I hope that there 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.900
 liked thank you
