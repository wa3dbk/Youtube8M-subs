 Recently, the DVR has become 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.290
 integral salon accessory any 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.330
 car a variety of models sometimes 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.950
 just be stupor about what 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.630
 technical specifications should 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.250
 possess this device and what is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.109
 important when buying a DVR 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.109
 learn from our expert 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.750
 in my opinion modern 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.880
 DVR should be maximized 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.660
 compact not stand out in the cabin 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 the car 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.040
 possess high quality and shooting 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.739
 also have a maximum set 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.010
 additional functions to these requirements 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.739
 fully meets procam cx4 exactly 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.840
 I would like to talk about him today as 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.070
 I have already mentioned 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.070
 DVR is very compact 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.660
 Made a black matte plastic and can 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.379
 easily fit behind a mirror 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 rear view 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.190
 DVR mount 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.170
 carried out through a special box 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 which food comes 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.059
 as well as it has a gps antenna 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.280
 the disadvantage of this mount is 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.039
 that the DVR cannot be turned in 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.740
 side and you can only turn up or 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.539
 down to install the DVR 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.160
 car just need to fix 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:15.160
 gps box on the windshield connect 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.200
 gps boxing power to 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.860
 power lead is not hung to the front 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.380
 glass 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.090
 you can always take it under the trim 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.080
 but this will require help 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.689
 auto electrician 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.049
 after we installed the mounts and 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.290
 fed power with one click we hold 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.119
 DVR it automatically 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.909
 turn on and start in Odessa 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.520
 note that for removing and 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.740
 DVR installation is not required 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 each time connect and disconnect the wire 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.180
 despite the miniature size 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.640
 DVR has a rich 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.869
 functional namely wide viewing angle 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.100
 140 degrees full hd 30 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.930
 frames per second 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.659
 Night shooting turns out very 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.150
 quality device day and night 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.580
 allocated by internal memory 8 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.280
 gigabyte of which is approximately 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.679
 about 1 hour of recording with maximum 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.300
 settings this memory you can 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.150
 use as main memory for 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.069
 video recording as well as backup it 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.410
 It will be relevant if it occurs 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.530
 need to copy the video to 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.959
 the scene of the incident give the main card 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.940
 aspects of ru as evidence function 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.980
 gps is also not superfluous because 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.500
 useful for fixing the speed of your 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.959
 movement as well as location on 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.810
 electronic maps sensor availability 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.580
 hitting and movement allows you to fix 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.920
 non-standard situations that may 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.110
 happen both on the move and during 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.840
 parking time unlike most 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.830
 compact video recorders this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.350
 model possesses 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.819
 one and a half inch screen interface 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.380
 very comfortable and does not cause any 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.930
 difficulties with settings 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.569
 I want to note the presence of a hot key 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.670
 pressing one of the recording mode buttons 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:03.160
 You can both turn off the microphone and 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.880
 protect current movie from further 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.239
 rewriting 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.239
 gps dvr included 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.290
 boxing car charger and 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.269
 usb cable for connecting SEC 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.709
 additional double sided tape with 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.880
 software 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.890
 as well as user manual 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.050
 conclusion it should be noted that the price of 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.030
 This DVR is quite acceptable 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.650
 and is approximately 6000 rubles 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.780
 agree that this is a small amount 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.970
 compared to the cost of cars it 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.310
 insurance and just your personal 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.290

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.290
