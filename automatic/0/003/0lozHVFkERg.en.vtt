00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.510
 hi friends with you substitute line and in 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.670
 this blog we discuss all the questions 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 food related to sports and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.090
 achieve excellent physical condition 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 last time talked to you about 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.020
 vitamins and today is the time 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 talk about minerals as i promised 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.040
 generally learn the more I think about 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.380
 of how many components is 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.060
 human nutrition and what a huge 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.740
 the number of things is basically necessary 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 consider the more I understand that if 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 zamorochitsya this really can 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
 I am of course all other things in life 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.970
 generally forget because if everyone 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.620
 element in the diet to devote at least 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 one program then half a life can 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.500
 talking about different elements 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 talking about how confused by him 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.829
 you need to become a man to each of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 of these elements 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.970
 integrate your diet exclusively 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.880
 in the right proportions also give it 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.739
 attention forget about it i'm trying to 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.540
 this blog to share with you practical 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 by methods 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.840
 introducing all these elements your 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 diet and most importantly those ways or 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 dishes that are used to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.530
 all these elements were present in my 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 nutrition to allow me to train 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 intense active and most importantly long and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 so saying minerals are inorganic 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 substances 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 the source of human minerals is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 first of all plant food 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 Sea food is also a good source 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.740
 minerals by virtue of being inhabited 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.740
 environment rich in minerals but in general can 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.720
 so to say that animals need 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700
 minerals and get them from the plant 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.049
 therefore, food is better for man 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.369
 minerals from plant foods 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.470
 which means the fact that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.689
 inorganic substances it means that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.790
 when heated minerals are nowhere 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.070
 disappear that is if you take 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.450
 any source of the world to taste 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.270
 I already have several on the table 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.360
 sources put them in the fire and they 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.799
 completely burned ashes and in general 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.409
 all that will remain is 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 their minerals cannot be destroyed 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.650
 can not be said about organic 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.390
 food components and so now on screen 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.100
 you see a list of the main minerals and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.409
 minor difference between these two 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 groups only in the amount that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.070
 necessary for the human body if in 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.350
 In the first case, the quantity is greater than 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.250
 the second case, the amount is less but those 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.750
 and other essential minerals in general 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 absolutely necessary to impart 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.760
 structures to the human body 4 percent 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.409
 demon man this 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.540
 niraly if you start looking in the literature 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.340
 those products that are good 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.230
 source of certain minerals then 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
 there are abundant sources then again and 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.500
 stumble again on products like 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.860
 dried apricots almonds nuts cashews and walnuts 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.360
 nut 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.879
 but naturally there are those products that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.470
 sort of like in nature there but we have them 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.420
 never seen in practice at 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 I do not know where to buy them so guys I 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.360
 chose those products that any of you 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.329
 will find anywhere 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.939
 these are the products we will now 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:51.500
 mercilessly smash special devices 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.959
 and so 50 grams of walnuts 50 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.650
 grams of cashews 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:01.250
 100 grams of almonds and 100 grams of dried apricots 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.659
 half a lemon like this 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.819
 forearm training 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:12.129
 great, it already smells great 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.129
 close or damn circling 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.280
 so apparently need to add more lemon 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.540
 some juice 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.680
 and another forearm on the mating 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:35.829
 priests gave Victoria I correctly what 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.599
 girls lemon juice and preservative you 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.870
 know as a child I remember that not 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.909
 once said the motto want to be always 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.430
 healthy mix dried apricots and walnut 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.069
 honey here is a lot more components 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.659
 the most interesting thing is that this mess well 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.930
 let's call it a cough and in fact 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.829
 This I do not even know what to compare it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.709
 fairly dry 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.049
 you can easily take it in a small 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.909
 container and to maintain energy strength 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.790
 and the influx of the very elements about which 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.099
 we say consume during the day as 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.840
 Well, what should I try now I think so 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.939
 have you ask why i didn't use 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.829
 ice I will answer that in my opinion honey 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.440
 too sugary a lot of sugar 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.360
 simple carbohydrates here dried apricots this 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.550
 function completely performed normally 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.880
 Ladozhsky excellent what can be said about 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.190
 this one is this product which 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.260
 the body really wants to chew that is 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.570
 chew in order to learn all 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.750
 these elements are so necessary 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.010
 great for maintaining strength and the most 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.260
 the main thing is that in this small amount 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.289
 contains more than the daily rate 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.940
 many components that is basically it 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.979
 and two days is enough but friends we 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.750
 cooked a dish today exclusively 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.760
 rich in minerals although possible with 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.940
 culinary point of view and not the most 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.440
 recognized perhaps even we are the first who 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.449
 this dish did yes I can tell you 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.099
 which is tasty enough in terms of 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.139
 its functional value 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.639
 there is simply no better dish because 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.139
 minerals here for two days as 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.090
 least so i welcome any 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.860
 criticisms regarding those 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.620
 the kind of dishes that we cook guys 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.110

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.180
 or just advise what you can do 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.190
 the best and how to make the dish tastier but with 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.440
 This so that they all were exclusively 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.900
 rich in useful for sports 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:29.729
 human elements exercise and good luck 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:32.020

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.990
 we weigh you now I'm still solid 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.990
 additive wait 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.360
 see how much will be 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:53.750

 generals even more experiment well and 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.890
 how do you get the road train and put it on top

 parsley and will look great
