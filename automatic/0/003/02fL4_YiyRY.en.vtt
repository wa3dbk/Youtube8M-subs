we're<00:04:12.550> almost<00:04:12.730> there

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.499 

so<00:04:30.770> now<00:04:30.949> we're<00:04:31.129> trying<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.400> create<00:04:31.580> an<00:04:31.879> S<00:04:32.150> shape

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
so now we're trying to create an S shape

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.540 
so now we're trying to create an S shape
and<00:04:32.780> we're<00:04:33.409> going<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.590> braid<00:04:33.800> back<00:04:34.129> in<00:04:34.400> the

and we're going to braid back in the
other<00:04:34.699> direction<00:04:39.370> now<00:04:40.370> however<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:41.270> hair

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
other direction now however the hair

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.089 
other direction now however the hair
we're<00:04:41.689> taking<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.199> coming<00:04:42.530> from<00:04:42.620> underneath

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
we're taking is coming from underneath

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:52.350 
we're taking is coming from underneath
the<00:04:43.340> braid<00:04:43.550> not<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.240> top

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.330 

so<00:04:53.169> at<00:04:53.289> braiding<00:04:53.650> back<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.129> other

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
so at braiding back in the other

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:06.400 
so at braiding back in the other
direction<00:04:54.669> back<00:04:55.569> to<00:04:55.599> where<00:04:55.900> we<00:04:56.020> started<00:04:56.500> from

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.680 

so<00:05:06.980> now<00:05:07.160> we've<00:05:07.370> got<00:05:07.580> back<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.180> where<00:05:08.330> we<00:05:08.480> came

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
so now we've got back to where we came

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.840 
so now we've got back to where we came
from<00:05:08.750> all<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.830> way<00:05:09.920> over<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.250> other<00:05:10.280> side<00:05:10.730> of
