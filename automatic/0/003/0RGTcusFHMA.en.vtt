the procedures that you can see that the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.160 
the procedures that you can see that the
frenum<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.730> has<00:00:50.730> encroached<00:00:51.449> upon<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.989> free

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
loss of attached gingiva here so we're

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.470 
loss of attached gingiva here so we're
going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> relieve<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.160> pull<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.969> frenum

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
we begin the excision we have removed

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.030 
we begin the excision we have removed
the<00:01:49.880> proximal<00:01:50.880> area<00:01:51.300> amid<00:01:51.870> an<00:01:51.990> incision<00:01:52.530> and

we have removed the proximal area amid
an<00:02:44.340> incision

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
an incision

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.090 
an incision
now<00:02:45.390> we're<00:02:45.570> going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> remove<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.560> labial

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
now we're going to remove the labial

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.910 
now we're going to remove the labial
section<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.760> front<00:02:49.010> using<00:02:50.010> 0.9<00:02:51.000> watts
