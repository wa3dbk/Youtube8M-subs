so Corsair link right there and I have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
so Corsair link right there and I have
it<00:00:43.800> pinned<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> bottom<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.760> well<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to let it run you out let it run it's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.920 
to let it run you out let it run it's
safe<00:00:51.840> its<00:00:52.050> corsair<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
safe its corsair so in this you get this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
safe its corsair so in this you get this
really<00:00:55.230> nice<00:00:55.579> overview<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.539> see

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
really nice overview where you can see

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.020 
really nice overview where you can see
how<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.469> least<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.859> mine<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.850> see

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
how much at least with mine you can see

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.569 
how much at least with mine you can see
how<00:01:00.120> much<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.539> h<00:01:00.930> 100<00:01:01.350> i<00:01:01.500> fans<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:02.039> working<00:01:02.430> on

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
how much the h 100 i fans are working on

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.950 
how much the h 100 i fans are working on
this<00:01:03.239> side<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:04.880> for<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.150> JD<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this side right here for a JD as well I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
this side right here for a JD as well I
would<00:01:07.170> guess<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.250> H<00:01:08.400> 100<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.909> temperature

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
would guess on the H 100 I temperature

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
would guess on the H 100 I temperature
the<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.680> could<00:01:10.830> change<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> LED<00:01:11.520> color<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the you could change the LED color and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990 
the you could change the LED color and
the<00:01:12.360> CPU<00:01:13.080> temperature<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.830> that's<00:01:14.610> that's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the CPU temperature so that's that's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.550 
the CPU temperature so that's that's
pretty<00:01:15.150> nice<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> GPU<00:01:16.320> temperature

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pretty nice and the GPU temperature

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
pretty nice and the GPU temperature
Western<00:01:17.159> Digital<00:01:17.310> Drive<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.030> monitor<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
Western Digital Drive so monitor is a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
Western Digital Drive so monitor is a
bunch<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> stuff<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.850> say

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
bunch of stuff and it's just I would say

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.359 
bunch of stuff and it's just I would say
it's<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.150> nice<00:01:21.890> systems<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> start<00:01:23.220> out

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's really nice systems to start out

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.620 
it's really nice systems to start out
with<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
is a blue and you can set it so that

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.539 
is a blue and you can set it so that
it's<00:01:57.670> just<00:01:57.759> off<00:01:58.360> it's<00:01:59.079> on<00:01:59.289> get<00:02:00.159> set<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.429> our

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
it's just off it's on get set it's our

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.300 
it's just off it's on get set it's our
pulses<00:02:01.030> as<00:02:01.210> well<00:02:01.390> like<00:02:02.110> all<00:02:02.289> let's<00:02:02.860> try<00:02:03.039> red

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
pulses as well like all let's try red

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.059 
pulses as well like all let's try red
pulsating<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:03.939> see<00:02:04.149> how<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.360> looks

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
pulsating and see how that looks

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.550 
pulsating and see how that looks
which<00:02:06.069> looks<00:02:06.579> pretty<00:02:06.819> good<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:08.019> pulsing<00:02:08.440> is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
which looks pretty good the pulsing is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.160 
which looks pretty good the pulsing is
definitely<00:02:08.950> not<00:02:09.069> too<00:02:09.429> smooth<00:02:09.849> but<00:02:10.690> personally

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
definitely not too smooth but personally

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.729 
definitely not too smooth but personally

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
do change it to balance mode you can

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.979 
do change it to balance mode you can
check<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.670> temperature<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.480> check<00:02:52.840> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
check the temperature of it to check the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.229 
check the temperature of it to check the
temperature<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.530> with<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.799> CPU<00:02:54.310> it's<00:02:55.030> very

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
temperature of it with you CPU it's very

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.030 
temperature of it with you CPU it's very
nice<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.690> general<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.620> would<00:02:56.799> highly

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
recommend using it I will link this into

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.309 
recommend using it I will link this into
the<00:02:59.769> description<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.519> course<00:03:00.670> or<00:03:00.910> link<00:03:01.319> and

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
the description of course or link and

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.069 
the description of course or link and
this<00:03:02.650> works<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> H<00:03:03.400> 80<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.359> h100

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
this works on the H 80 and h100

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.289 
this works on the H 80 and h100
I<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.470> believe<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:05.889> also<00:03:06.100> works<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.579> H<00:03:06.790> 110

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
I I believe it also works on the H 110

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.740 
I I believe it also works on the H 110
if<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.720> has<00:03:07.900> an<00:03:08.049> LED<00:03:08.170> light<00:03:08.680> inside<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.370> um

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
if that has an LED light inside of it um

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.289 
if that has an LED light inside of it um
