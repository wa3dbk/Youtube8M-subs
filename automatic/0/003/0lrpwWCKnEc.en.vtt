be a little late to the party but I've

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.440 
be a little late to the party but I've
been<00:00:07.440> marathoning<00:00:07.950> through<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.309> 2.5<00:00:08.849> content

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450

been marathoning through the 2.5 content
and<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.870> think<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.230> just<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.469> terms<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.830> story

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
and I think that just in terms of story

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
and I think that just in terms of story
progression<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.630> definitely<00:00:13.049> been<00:00:13.230> my

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
progression it has definitely been my

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.749 
progression it has definitely been my

motivation for him to act against us was

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.450 
motivation for him to act against us was
as<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.240> have<00:05:38.360> said<00:05:38.660> a<00:05:38.870> really<00:05:39.290> neat<00:05:39.650> and<00:05:39.890> well

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
as I have said a really neat and well

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.810 
as I have said a really neat and well
placed<00:05:40.940> plot<00:05:41.600> pivot<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.040> scenes<00:05:43.400> now<00:05:43.610> have

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
placed plot pivot the a scenes now have

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.090 
placed plot pivot the a scenes now have
a<00:05:43.850> window<00:05:44.240> by<00:05:44.420> which<00:05:44.630> they<00:05:45.020> perceive<00:05:45.560> us<00:05:45.590> as

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
a window by which they perceive us as

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.850 
a window by which they perceive us as
vulnerable<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.450> we<00:05:48.050> in<00:05:48.200> turn<00:05:48.470> have<00:05:48.500> an

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
vulnerable and we in turn have an

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.800 
vulnerable and we in turn have an
effective<00:05:49.250> means<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.580> destroy<00:05:50.120> them<00:05:50.360> so<00:05:50.780> I

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
effective means to destroy them so I

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.510 
effective means to destroy them so I
think<00:05:50.960> we<00:05:51.200> can<00:05:51.320> expect<00:05:51.650> that<00:05:51.860> whole<00:05:52.100> realm<00:05:52.400> of

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
think we can expect that whole realm of

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.230 
think we can expect that whole realm of
the<00:05:52.640> story<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:53.090> really<00:05:53.630> pick<00:05:53.870> up<00:05:54.020> pace<00:05:55.240> finally

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
the story to really pick up pace finally

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.510 
the story to really pick up pace finally
and<00:05:56.570> this<00:05:56.660> might<00:05:57.290> not<00:05:57.440> seem<00:05:57.680> like<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.890> big<00:05:57.980> focal

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
and this might not seem like a big focal

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.550 
and this might not seem like a big focal
point<00:05:58.760> but<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.210> Imperials<00:05:59.660> are<00:05:59.840> very<00:06:00.320> much

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
point but the Imperials are very much
