have that built it right in with your

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
have that built it right in with your

that<00:02:44.100> way<00:02:44.520> now<00:02:45.090> there's<00:02:45.270> an<00:02:45.390> asterisk<00:02:45.840> here

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that way now there's an asterisk here

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.870 
that way now there's an asterisk here
but<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:46.500> see<00:02:46.800> where<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> asterisks<00:02:47.760> is

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
but I don't see where the asterisks is

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.880 
but I don't see where the asterisks is
linked<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.960> may<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
linked to so that may just be for the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.980 
linked to so that may just be for the
LED<00:02:50.490> modeling<00:02:51.060> light<00:02:51.300> probably<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:51.900> of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
LED modeling light probably because of

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.770 
LED modeling light probably because of
the<00:02:52.080> video<00:02:52.380> function<00:02:53.240> it's<00:02:54.240> two<00:02:54.480> point<00:02:54.690> eight

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780

really great little light just come out

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.520 
really great little light just come out
from<00:03:08.370> Canon<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.300> 320<00:03:10.050> X<00:03:10.580> DX<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.320> big

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
from Canon the 320 X DX it's the big

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
from Canon the 320 X DX it's the big
thing<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.040> built-in<00:03:14.400> LED<00:03:15.210> light<00:03:15.240> I'm<00:03:15.510> really

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
thing the built-in LED light I'm really

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.610 
thing the built-in LED light I'm really
excited<00:03:16.050> about<00:03:16.230> that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
excited about that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.850 
excited about that
it's<00:03:17.610> got<00:03:17.910> vertical<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.200> horizontal<00:03:19.230> bounce

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
it's got vertical and horizontal bounce

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.370 
it's got vertical and horizontal bounce
capability<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:21.300> has<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:24.020> function<00:03:25.020> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
capability it has the the function the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.300 
capability it has the the function the
flash<00:03:25.590> release<00:03:25.890> function<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:28.800> wireless

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
flash release function for the wireless

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.030 
flash release function for the wireless
and<00:03:30.050> actually<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.170> new<00:03:31.350> flash<00:03:31.650> release

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
and actually the new flash release

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.650 
and actually the new flash release
function<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.670> says<00:03:32.850> triggers<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.450> camera

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
function it says triggers the camera

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.480 
function it says triggers the camera
wirelessly<00:03:34.470> from<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.920> flash<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.460> a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
wirelessly from the flash on a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.580 
wirelessly from the flash on a
two-second<00:03:36.180> delay<00:03:36.270> so<00:03:36.480> that's<00:03:36.810> new<00:03:37.050> that's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
two-second delay so that's new that's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.720 
two-second delay so that's new that's
kind<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.920> cool

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
kind of cool

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.720 
kind of cool
wire<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> wireless<00:03:39.630> slave<00:03:40.080> function<00:03:40.730> so

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
wire and the wireless slave function so

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.630 
wire and the wireless slave function so
basically<00:03:42.710> some<00:03:43.710> really<00:03:44.040> good<00:03:44.220> reasons<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
basically some really good reasons to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.150 
basically some really good reasons to
consider<00:03:45.270> this<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.810> an<00:03:46.020> economical<00:03:46.830> flash

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
consider this as an economical flash

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.970 
consider this as an economical flash
especially<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.300> off<00:03:48.480> camera<00:03:49.110> if<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.680> want<00:03:49.890> it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
especially for off camera if you want it

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.890 
especially for off camera if you want it
as<00:03:50.100> one<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.400> your<00:03:50.490> remotes<00:03:50.850> they're<00:03:51.480> cheaper

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
as one of your remotes they're cheaper

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
as one of your remotes they're cheaper
than<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.500> other<00:03:52.590> ones<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.400> can<00:03:53.640> pick<00:03:53.820> up

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
than the other ones so you can pick up

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.240 
than the other ones so you can pick up
more<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.780> more<00:03:55.020> remotes<00:03:55.350> off<00:03:55.560> camera<00:03:56.070> and

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
more so have more remotes off camera and

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.940 
more so have more remotes off camera and
the<00:03:56.820> built-in<00:03:57.210> LED<00:03:57.810> light<00:03:57.840> really<00:03:58.500> excited

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
the built-in LED light really excited

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.040 
the built-in LED light really excited
about<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.220> so<00:04:00.000> anyways<00:04:00.240> that's<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.660> Canon

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
about that so anyways that's the Canon

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.460 
about that so anyways that's the Canon
320<00:04:01.740> X<00:04:02.100> in<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.490> nutshell<00:04:02.760> folks<00:04:03.330> check<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.320> out

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
320 X in a nutshell folks check it out

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.860 
320 X in a nutshell folks check it out
we<00:04:05.310> back<00:04:05.550> soon<00:04:05.850> I'll<00:04:06.000> do<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.120> comparison

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
we back soon I'll do a comparison

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.580 
we back soon I'll do a comparison
against<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> 430<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:09.750> can<00:04:09.930> see<00:04:10.260> what<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
against the 430 and you can see what the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.890 
against the 430 and you can see what the
differences<00:04:11.070> are<00:04:11.130> there<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.850> whether<00:04:12.720> you

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
differences are there and whether you

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.050
