00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.700 

that's<00:00:48.879> more<00:00:49.090> intense<00:00:49.360> than<00:00:49.539> sharknado<00:00:50.110> that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
that's more intense than sharknado that

I've<00:01:07.509> ever<00:01:07.690> seen<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.259> 23<00:01:08.830> years<00:01:08.979> of<00:01:09.040> Shark<00:01:09.310> Week

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
I've ever seen in 23 years of Shark Week

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.310 
I've ever seen in 23 years of Shark Week
over<00:01:09.700> 18<00:01:10.270> feet<00:01:10.299> long<00:01:10.479> that's<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.960> conservative

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
over 18 feet long that's a conservative

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.870 
over 18 feet long that's a conservative
estimate<00:01:11.619> might<00:01:12.100> have<00:01:12.190> been<00:01:12.310> 20<00:01:12.580> and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
estimate might have been 20 and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.749 
estimate might have been 20 and
extremely<00:01:13.810> aggressive<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:14.590> Brandon<00:01:15.070> was<00:01:15.250> well

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
extremely aggressive so Brandon was well

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.850 
extremely aggressive so Brandon was well
they<00:01:16.659> put<00:01:16.869> this<00:01:16.960> way<00:01:17.170> he<00:01:17.380> had<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.590> change<00:01:17.770> his

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
they put this way he had to change his

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.219 
they put this way he had to change his
wetsuit<00:01:18.130> after<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:18.910> dive<00:01:19.119> how<00:01:19.570> dangerous<00:01:19.960> is

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
wetsuit after that dive how dangerous is

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.410 
wetsuit after that dive how dangerous is
it<00:01:20.410> actually<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.160> that<00:01:21.399> case<00:01:21.670> sharks<00:01:22.210> have

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
it actually in that case sharks have

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.540 
it actually in that case sharks have
enough<00:01:22.690> power<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.289> break<00:01:23.830> into<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.250> cage

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
enough power to break into that cage

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.430 
enough power to break into that cage
very<00:01:24.789> easily<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.390> cage<00:01:25.869> is<00:01:26.050> really<00:01:26.259> like<00:01:26.409> a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
very easily a cage is really like a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.980 
very easily a cage is really like a
bluff<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:27.580> know<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.729> shark<00:01:28.000> hits<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.509> with

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
bluff you know the shark hits it with

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.620 
bluff you know the shark hits it with
his<00:01:29.110> nose<00:01:29.320> he<00:01:29.530> feels<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.970> then<00:01:31.090> he<00:01:31.240> decides

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
his nose he feels it and then he decides

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.149 
his nose he feels it and then he decides
this<00:01:31.869> isn't<00:01:32.200> something<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:32.710> really<00:01:32.950> want<00:01:33.130> to

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
this isn't something I really want to

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.499 
this isn't something I really want to
deal<00:01:33.340> with<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:33.789> just<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.030> little<00:01:34.240> bit<00:01:34.330> too

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
deal with it's just a little bit too

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.899 
deal with it's just a little bit too
hard<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.619> if<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:35.950> really<00:01:36.159> wanted<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.610> get<00:01:36.759> in

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
hard but if you really wanted to get in

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.180 
hard but if you really wanted to get in
there<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.179> get<00:01:37.330> him<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.659> could<00:01:37.929> what<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.950> chose

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
there and get him it could what it chose

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.790 
there and get him it could what it chose
to<00:01:39.220> bite<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.759> scene<00:01:40.179> was<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.630> float<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
to bite in that scene was the float the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.380 
to bite in that scene was the float the
nice<00:01:41.979> soft<00:01:42.280> float<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.819> was<00:01:42.970> holding<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
nice soft float that was holding the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.359 
nice soft float that was holding the
cage<00:01:43.569> up<00:01:43.840> was<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.229> little<00:01:44.289> problematic<00:01:45.220> because

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
cage up was a little problematic because

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.859 
cage up was a little problematic because
if<00:01:45.700> he<00:01:45.819> bites<00:01:46.000> all<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.300> floats<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.720> cage

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
if he bites all the floats the cage

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.800 
if he bites all the floats the cage
sinks<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.350> bottom<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.690> sharks<00:01:49.690> are

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
sinks to the bottom but sharks are

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.850 
sinks to the bottom but sharks are
really<00:01:49.960> smart<00:01:50.289> people<00:01:50.440> don't<00:01:50.649> give<00:01:50.770> them

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
really smart people don't give them

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.410 
really smart people don't give them
enough<00:01:51.009> credit<00:01:51.040> they<00:01:51.520> understand<00:01:52.060> things

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
enough credit they understand things

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.190 
enough credit they understand things
that<00:01:52.630> are<00:01:52.750> actually<00:01:53.140> edible<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.670> things<00:01:54.969> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that are actually edible and things that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.420 
that are actually edible and things that
they<00:01:56.200> should<00:01:56.409> attack<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.950> shouldn't<00:01:57.219> attack

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
they should attack and shouldn't attack

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.760 
they should attack and shouldn't attack
so<00:01:57.729> they're<00:01:57.880> very<00:01:57.909> adaptable<00:01:58.780> they<00:01:59.469> learn

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770
