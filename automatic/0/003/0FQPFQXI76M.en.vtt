configure<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.830> map<00:02:41.100> size<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.790> let's<00:02:42.120> say<00:02:42.420> I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
configure your map size so let's say I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.460 
configure your map size so let's say I
wanted<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.100> 300<00:02:44.940> x<00:02:45.180> 150<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.290> set

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
wanted to have it 300 x 150 I just set

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.520 
wanted to have it 300 x 150 I just set
that<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.040> um<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.390> my<00:02:48.600> opinion<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:49.080> think<00:02:49.110> heat

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that and um in my opinion I think heat

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.430 
that and um in my opinion I think heat
maps<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.920> really<00:02:50.340> cool-looking<00:02:50.580> effect<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.989> um

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
maps a really cool-looking effect but um

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.190 
maps a really cool-looking effect but um
you<00:02:52.950> cannot<00:02:53.280> configure<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.060> pin<00:02:54.690> shape<00:02:54.989> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
you cannot configure the pin shape and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.930 
you cannot configure the pin shape and
pink<00:02:55.440> color<00:02:55.680> but<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.370> want<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.580> check<00:02:56.730> that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
pink color but if you want to check that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.360 
pink color but if you want to check that
out<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.330> displays<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.709> if<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.160> was<00:02:59.250> an

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
out it displays it as in if it was an

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
out it displays it as in if it was an
infrared<00:02:59.790> goggles<00:03:00.090> or<00:03:00.510> something<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
infrared goggles or something like that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.380 
infrared goggles or something like that
but<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.769> looks<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.220> cool<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:02.880> see

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but it looks really cool and you can see

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.500 
but it looks really cool and you can see
where<00:03:04.080> your<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:04.830> heat<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:05.970> your<00:03:06.090> website
