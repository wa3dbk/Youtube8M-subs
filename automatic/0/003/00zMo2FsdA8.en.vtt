00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.509 
what's he doing why's he stood so far
back<00:00:25.050> yes<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> obviously<00:00:26.010> looks<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.340> they

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
back yes it obviously looks like they

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.859 
back yes it obviously looks like they
they're<00:00:26.699> pre<00:00:26.939> calling<00:00:27.269> us<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.599> bringing

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
they're pre calling us and bringing

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
they're pre calling us and bringing
themselves<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.590> huddle<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
themselves into little huddle so that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.769 
themselves into little huddle so that
the<00:00:29.369> opponents<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.910> hear<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.570> probably

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the opponents can hear they probably

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.089 
the opponents can hear they probably
have<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> couple<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.410> moves<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.980> they've

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
have a couple of moves that they've

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.200 
have a couple of moves that they've
worked<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.520> couple<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.790> triggers<00:00:33.090> as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
worked on a couple of triggers as

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.729 
worked on a couple of triggers as
they're<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> line<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.230> try<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
they're going to line out and try to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 
they're going to line out and try to
capitalize<00:00:35.030> when<00:00:36.030> they<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.329> opportunity

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
capitalize when they see an opportunity

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.869 
capitalize when they see an opportunity
so<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.559> people<00:00:37.710> probably<00:00:37.980> walk<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.489> last

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
so I think people probably walk in last

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
so I think people probably walk in last
and<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.780> he<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> spot<00:00:40.200> any<00:00:40.590> hinges<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and see if he can spot any hinges to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.440 
and see if he can spot any hinges to
work<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.579> yeah<00:00:41.700> he's<00:00:41.820> letting<00:00:42.030> his<00:00:42.180> troops

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
work on so yeah he's letting his troops

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.970 
work on so yeah he's letting his troops
go<00:00:42.690> he's<00:00:42.870> constantly<00:00:43.530> assessing<00:00:43.770> because

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
go he's constantly assessing because

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
go he's constantly assessing because
Northampton<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.670> moving<00:00:45.000> positions

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
Northampton and moving positions

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.840 
Northampton and moving positions
constantly<00:00:45.989> trying<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> con<00:00:46.860> him<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.309> not

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
constantly trying to con him into not

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.279 
constantly trying to con him into not
being<00:00:48.120> able<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> work<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.780> how<00:00:48.989> they're<00:00:49.200> going

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
being able to work out how they're going

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
being able to work out how they're going
to<00:00:49.379> defend<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> line<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.760> gets<00:00:50.969> there

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to defend this line out as he gets there

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
to defend this line out as he gets there
you<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:51.809> calls<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.469> check

go<00:01:21.720> around<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> other<00:01:22.140> side<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
go around the other side where the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
go around the other side where the
defenders<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.670> talk<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:24.180> what

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
defenders are and just talk about what

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.929 
defenders are and just talk about what
the<00:01:24.900> attacking<00:01:25.229> side<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.799> looking<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.310> okay

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the attacking side are looking for okay

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.359 
the attacking side are looking for okay
so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.600> can't<00:01:27.869> mark<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.320> areas<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> defense

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
so you can't mark all areas as a defense

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
so you can't mark all areas as a defense
because<00:01:29.700> there<00:01:29.850> aren't<00:01:30.000> enough<00:01:30.150> bodies<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
because there aren't enough bodies so in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
because there aren't enough bodies so in
this<00:01:31.650> scenario<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.250> defenders<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:32.970> from

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this scenario the defenders here from

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
this scenario the defenders here from
Tabar<00:01:33.600> they've<00:01:34.049> got<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.439> pot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> three<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
Tabar they've got a pot of three in the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
Tabar they've got a pot of three in the
middle<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> pot<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.540> three<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
middle and then a pot of three at the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.929 
middle and then a pot of three at the
front<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> thinking<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.310> you

might<00:02:35.250> walk<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:35.670> two<00:02:35.820> cores<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.180> mean<00:02:36.300> that

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
might walk in with two cores I mean that

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.880 
might walk in with two cores I mean that
first<00:02:36.690> when<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.050> three<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.470> do<00:02:37.590> two

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
first when you get three if we do two

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.860 
first when you get three if we do two
these<00:02:38.580> chaps<00:02:38.820> would<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.060> noticed<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.780> know

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
these chaps would have noticed you know

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.240 
these chaps would have noticed you know
the<00:02:40.050> middle<00:02:40.170> opportunity<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> cooler<00:02:41.070> at<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the middle opportunity the cooler at the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.190 
the middle opportunity the cooler at the
back<00:02:41.490> would<00:02:41.670> say<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.930> banging<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:43.170> are

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
back would say to banging there we are

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
back would say to banging there we are
just<00:02:43.680> nice<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.070> simple<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.880> mentioned

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
just nice and simple and you mentioned

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
just nice and simple and you mentioned
about<00:02:45.720> those<00:02:46.290> scrum-half<00:02:46.620> sand<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> fact

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
about those scrum-half sand and the fact

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
about those scrum-half sand and the fact
that<00:02:47.700> they<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.210> ball<00:02:48.390> off<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.080> back

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
that they like the ball off the back

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.860 
that they like the ball off the back
what<00:02:49.530> happens<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
what happens if we have you know the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.210 
what happens if we have you know the
middle<00:02:51.990> if<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.350> guys<00:02:52.530> move<00:02:52.770> back<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> little

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
middle if you guys move back a little

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.520 
middle if you guys move back a little
bit<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.780> take<00:02:54.780> away<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.110> front<00:02:55.350> ball

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
bit just to take away that front ball

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.560 
bit just to take away that front ball
okay<00:02:56.100> they're<00:02:56.490> giving<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> front<00:02:57.390> but

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
okay they're giving you the front but

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.120 
okay they're giving you the front but
you're<00:02:57.690> scrum-half<00:02:57.990> might<00:02:58.440> say<00:02:58.650> well<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.860> don't

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
you're scrum-half might say well I don't

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.740 
you're scrum-half might say well I don't
really<00:02:59.520> want<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.850> attack<00:03:00.180> with<00:03:00.360> ball<00:03:00.540> from

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
really want to attack with ball from

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.150 
really want to attack with ball from
there<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.110> what<00:03:01.260> are<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.410> thinking<00:03:01.710> then<00:03:01.860> so

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
there so what are you thinking then so

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.710 
there so what are you thinking then so
then<00:03:02.280> you've<00:03:02.400> got<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.610> try<00:03:02.760> G<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:03.150> away<00:03:03.450> of

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
then you've got to try G right away of

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.510 
then you've got to try G right away of
getting<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.680> ball<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> back<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.400> and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
getting that ball to the back in and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.650 
getting that ball to the back in and
we've<00:03:05.610> all<00:03:05.700> got<00:03:05.730> chicks<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.150> our<00:03:06.270> sleeves<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
we've all got chicks up our sleeves and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.110 
we've all got chicks up our sleeves and
defenses<00:03:07.410> shift<00:03:07.620> around<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.980> lot<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.000> do

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
defenses shift around a lot so if we do

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.670 
defenses shift around a lot so if we do
a<00:03:09.150> four<00:03:09.450> boys<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.840> sees<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.080> bit<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.290> movements

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
a four boys that sees a bit of movements

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.530 
a four boys that sees a bit of movements
creates<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> dam<00:03:11.460> in<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> middle<00:03:11.910> hoping<00:03:12.390> we're

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
creates a dam in the middle hoping we're

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.000 
creates a dam in the middle hoping we're
hoping<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.870> defensive<00:03:13.530> pod<00:03:13.710> will<00:03:13.860> pull

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
hoping this defensive pod will pull

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.340 
hoping this defensive pod will pull
forward<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:14.880> creates<00:03:15.240> an<00:03:15.390> open<00:03:16.020> space<00:03:16.170> at

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
forward which creates an open space at

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.330 
forward which creates an open space at
the<00:03:16.410> back<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.740> well<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.160> bit<00:03:17.280> of

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the back as well so it's a bit of

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.070 
the back as well so it's a bit of
guesswork<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.510> drills<00:03:18.750> got<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.990> be

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
guesswork you know the drills got to be

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.180 
guesswork you know the drills got to be
good<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.710> could<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:19.920> done<00:03:20.070> your

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
good and you could have done your

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.500 
good and you could have done your
homework<00:03:20.220> or<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.820> now<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.240> just<00:03:21.270> go

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
homework or so on now if we just go

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.760 
homework or so on now if we just go
through<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.870> one<00:03:21.960> again<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.200> reset<00:03:22.680> that

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
through that one again just reset that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.070 
through that one again just reset that
really<00:03:23.070> quickly<00:03:23.300> what's<00:03:24.300> happened<00:03:24.690> there<00:03:24.900> is

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
really quickly what's happened there is

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.870 
really quickly what's happened there is
is<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.410> guys<00:03:25.590> come<00:03:25.890> from<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.190> middle<00:03:26.460> to<00:03:26.610> drag

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
is the guys come from the middle to drag

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.820 
is the guys come from the middle to drag
that<00:03:27.090> pod<00:03:27.360> forward<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.050> then<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> hidden

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
that pod forward and then a hidden

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.860 
that pod forward and then a hidden
player<00:03:29.100> right<00:03:29.400> at<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.610> front<00:03:29.910> has<00:03:30.390> come<00:03:30.660> round

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
player right at the front has come round

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.840 
player right at the front has come round
so<00:03:31.080> he's<00:03:31.260> hoping<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.740> have<00:03:31.980> come<00:03:32.190> from<00:03:32.580> their

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
so he's hoping to have come from their

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.640 
so he's hoping to have come from their
blind<00:03:33.090> spot<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.450> by<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.720> time<00:03:34.020> they<00:03:34.200> see<00:03:34.260> him

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
blind spot and by the time they see him

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.110 
blind spot and by the time they see him
they<00:03:35.010> haven't<00:03:35.280> got<00:03:35.370> time<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.730> react<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
they haven't got time to react the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.400 
they haven't got time to react the
absolute<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.510> often<00:03:36.750> hard<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.990> clock<00:03:37.230> that

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
absolute is often hard to clock that

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.990 
absolute is often hard to clock that
back<00:03:37.590> player<00:03:37.890> coming<00:03:38.190> from<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.400> front<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.820> I

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
back player coming from the front and I

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400 
back player coming from the front and I
guess<00:03:39.420> see<00:03:39.540> there's<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.840> million<00:03:40.140> variations

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
guess see there's a million variations

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.500 
guess see there's a million variations
and<00:03:40.950> how<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.100> can<00:03:41.280> be<00:03:41.460> done<00:03:41.490> but<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.270> soon<00:03:42.420> as

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
and how it can be done but as soon as

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.790 
and how it can be done but as soon as
you<00:03:42.600> drag<00:03:42.780> pods<00:03:43.050> forward<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.410> soon<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.650> put

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
you drag pods forward as soon as you put

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.260 
you drag pods forward as soon as you put
them<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.010> uncomfortable<00:03:44.310> positions<00:03:44.640> he

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
them in uncomfortable positions he

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.310 
them in uncomfortable positions he
created<00:03:45.570> weaknesses<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.140> try<00:03:46.260> to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
created weaknesses and you try to

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.620 
created weaknesses and you try to
capitalize<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.280> give<00:03:47.670> those<00:03:48.000> really

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
capitalize on it and give those really

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.870 
capitalize on it and give those really
annoying<00:03:48.930> scrum<00:03:49.470> holes<00:03:49.710> are<00:03:50.070> constantly<00:03:50.700> in

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
annoying scrum holes are constantly in

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.360 
annoying scrum holes are constantly in
your<00:03:51.060> ear
