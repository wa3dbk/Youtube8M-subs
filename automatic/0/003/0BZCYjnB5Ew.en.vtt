00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
how to make it we know the intricate the

how to make it we know the intricate the
physics<00:01:19.290> behind<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> actually

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
physics behind it but it's actually

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
physics behind it but it's actually
turning<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.439> acceptable<00:01:23.009> number

turning them out in an acceptable number

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
turning them out in an acceptable number
that's<00:01:23.729> always<00:01:24.000> been<00:01:24.270> difficult<00:01:24.630> because

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that's always been difficult because

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.800 
that's always been difficult because
obviously<00:01:25.560> cost<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.369> very<00:01:26.430> high<00:01:26.689> when<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
obviously cost is very high when you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.870 
obviously cost is very high when you
don't<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.530> large<00:01:28.950> quantities
