00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
of immersion with the game itself it's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
of immersion with the game itself it's
like<00:01:43.740> those<00:01:43.970> things<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.149> over<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.659> eyes

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

yeah<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.049> kind<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.619> much

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
yeah it's kind of like that but much

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.520 
yeah it's kind of like that but much

mean<00:05:28.710> if<00:05:28.980> you<00:05:29.190> think<00:05:29.220> about<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.580> again<00:05:29.700> closer

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
mean if you think about it again closer

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.690

and closer
honestly<00:05:33.700> I<00:05:33.760> think<00:05:33.850> in<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.690> future<00:05:34.720> pc<00:05:35.200> gamers

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
honestly I think in the future pc gamers

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.840 
honestly I think in the future pc gamers
are<00:05:35.620> gonna<00:05:35.710> end<00:05:35.800> up<00:05:35.950> going<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.430> consoles
