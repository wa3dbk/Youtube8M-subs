00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.950
 video tutorial of cinema 4d in this 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.690
 occasion we will make that glass with water 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.040
 who see here on the screen with a lot 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.040
 ice we started 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.119
 good first thing we're going to do what 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.100
 let's go to the primitives and we're going to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.690
 look for the cylinder object here in the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.450
 properties we are going to put the following 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.660
 data let's put 70 in radio 30 in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.100
 height 10 in height segments and in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 segments of the rotation we are going to put 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 the 50 we're going to zoom 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.720
 and we are going to accommodate here in this part 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 after this we are going to insert now a 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.770
 tube we do not go here again to the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.270
 primitives and we look for the tube option 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.310
 here we are going to put the following 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.870
 values ​​we're going to put the 67 in radio 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.150
 internal 70 on the outer radio 50 in 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.890
 segments of the rotation in segments in 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.540
 the lid we are going to put the value of 1 and 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.870
 here in height we will change it for 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.510
 200 activate the singing option and here 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.640
 let's put the following in segments 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.830
 let's leave the value of 8 in radio what 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390
 we left like it was 1.5 because 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.790
 we were going to accommodate it we are going to upload a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.380
 little so he wants one more way 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.090
 exact we can activate the four 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.740
 panels with the middle button and here in 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.140
 this view either the front by the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.640
 right we can see that really that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.470
 stay on the other object 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.300
 here for example we observe that it is 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.770
 alright then let's click on the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.409
 central button we organize here in the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.880
 perspective view and we continue then 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.920
 of this to simulate what would be the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.110
 water let's insert another cylinder we 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 we go here to the primitives and we look 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.150
 the cylinder option we are going to put you here 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.690
 in radius 67 in height we are going to put 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.820
 the value of 170 we leave 1 here in 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.890
 segments in height and in segments in the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.830
 rotation let's put the value of 50 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.800
 after this we are going to upload it so that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.360
 are obviously inside the glass here 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 we can be guided again by the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.060
 front view let's activate it and let's go 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 to fertilize the water accommodates in this way 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.530
 we return with the central button to the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.480
 perspective view and let's now create 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 the ice cubes to do it we go 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.319
 to precisely hide this cylinder that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.780
 simulate water let's click here 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.550
 in this part to hide it and now 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.950
 let's insert active is primitive 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.180
 which would be precisely the cube and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.980
 now let's change here what it is 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.030
 the size on x axis we are going to put it 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.050
 center on each in both x and jim z 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.720
 60 and 60 thousand and we sing the song and here you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.190
 let's put the value of 10 in radio and 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.140
 in subdivision of the song let's put 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.670
 the value of 7 now to accommodate this 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.440
 ice cube we will choose with the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.750
 central button and we will support in 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.459
 these two views then let's go up 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.549
 slightly what ice would be what 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.840
 let's put here in this part and then 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.700
 of that we have to make another copy 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.900
 let's make three ice cubes like that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.000
 that we keep pressing the key 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 control while we move to do 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.560
 the next ice cube we are going to 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.540
 place it here on top of this but let's go 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.069
 to put a little bit to the right here 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.959
 the location of the ice cubes 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.000
 that gives the taste of each one is case what 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.240
 they put here on the right side and we're going to 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.640
 rotate it slightly 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.700
 so that it is not the same as the other 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.470
 that has some certain rotation and here 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.260
 we are going to turn it in this way 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.490
 is that more or less like this here he supports me with 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.440
 this view of the place click on the button 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.530
 central and let's move slightly 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.970
 the ice cube we are going to send it a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.350
 little bit 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.270
 went down to the left we there 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.280
 we click again with the central button 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.930
 and we're going to create another ice cube like that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.180
 that we keep pressing the key 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.270
 control and we drag this ice cube 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.830
 up here the idea is that this 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.570
 last ice cube is above 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 of the surface of the water so let's go 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.580
 to also rotate it and we select this 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.560
 tool and we're going to give it a light 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.410
 inclination 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.760
 let's put it like this this way and this 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.100
 ulna I'm going to express a little 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.319
 upwards 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.090
 let's see it this way 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.640
 let's leave it 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.260
 there it would be fine and well let's give it 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.330
 click a central button or come back here 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.570
 the perspective list we see that it comes out 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:23.480
 too much I'm going to go down a bit more 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.480
 let's manipulate with this view 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.810
 but there 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.910
 this cube manages to shift a bit towards 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.790
 the right the selection does not move a 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.470
 little for 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.470
 let's see if he did not get out of the glass 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.650
 well that's fine if we do not come back 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.780
 again in perspective view 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.060
 here we notice that it has slightly 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.890
 come out the ice cube is perfect 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.720
 as it was and well now only missing 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.550
 texturize each of the objects we go 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.800
 here the window menu to the option 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.810
 content browser and here we go 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.300
 to go to the basic folder and let's search 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.740
 this texture called glass 001 we're going 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.810
 to double click to add it here to 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.730
 our material manager all of us 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.810
 we went to the miscellany folder and here 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.660
 let's add the following 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.660
 materials we are going to look for those that are 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.350
 bungee here I will select the bungee 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.330
 glass 001 we double click on 0 04 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.669
 Double click 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.189
 and finally the man your upper double 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.139
 click also after that we close the 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.120
 content browser 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.590
 the texture of bungee big pearl let's 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.210
 use for these three cubes of 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.430
 ice so we selected the three 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.409
 cubes and now we drag the texture 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.419
 about the object here in this part only 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.270
 we apply it here we already see that 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.409
 the three textures are applied 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.240
 we activate our cylinder which is the one 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.819
 represents the water that is inside 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.590
 our glass and that cylinder that we're going to 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.590
 apply the following texture the bungee 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.499
 glass 004 we only apply here what 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.389
 it would be the water and this texture the 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:57.069
 I selected in case they wanted to give it another 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.069
 tonality to what would be the liquid or the 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:02.740
 water but just as good there we leave it and 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.479
 Finally in this texture of glass 001 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.060
 It will be applied to both the tube and the 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.710
 cylinder that represents in the glass 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.390
 we select the two objects and 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.220
 we drag the texture on them 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.560
 we can already see that those who explained 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.270
 well then what are we going to do 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.850
 now it's adding a sky we're going here 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.170
 this button we add a sky and we 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.660
 we go back to what would be 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.450
 our window to the browser option 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.790
 of content we went here to the 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.560
 hdr folder and I will reselect 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.210
 this same texture that is what I explain 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.470
 in the video that I just mentioned 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.260
 we double click 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.210
 we close this window if we apply it to 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.860
 heaven 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.630
 and here in the label options 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.180
 let's change the projection by the 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.949
 flat option after this so you do not 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.660
 see here in the background what we're going to 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.370
 apply we are going to click on the 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.310
 right to heaven we go to cinema 4d 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.319
 labels and we select the label 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.940
 composition and on the bottom 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.610
 we simply disable the option 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.979
 visible by the camera so now we have 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.389
 the texture in the background finally let's 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.849
 to click here to the options of 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:09.560
 rendering and we're going to get here in 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:09.560
 effects the environmental occlusion 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.190
 we close this window and well before 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.650
 render I'm going to tilt slightly 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.370
 our camera is going to rotate this for 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:23.230
 give more or less this inclination let's 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.720
 to talk a little we zoom 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.180
 we refocus we make it stay 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.860
 there and now we are going to click on the 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.289
 done button to see our 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.999
 final composition 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.249
 and good and that is finally the result 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:39.279
 that we get a pretty good result 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:40.990
 realistic personally I loved so 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.129
 how good we are at the end of this 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.749
 videotutorial I hope you have them 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:46.649
 liked and see you until the next 

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:46.649
 Thank you
