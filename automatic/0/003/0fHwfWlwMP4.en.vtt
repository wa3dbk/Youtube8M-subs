00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
this base over here for example there's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.990 
this base over here for example there's
lots<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:22.130> different<00:01:22.400> vases<00:01:22.670> out<00:01:22.790> there<00:01:22.940> this

the<00:01:26.600> fact<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.140> one<00:01:27.320> holds<00:01:27.560> five<00:01:27.710> single

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the fact that this one holds five single

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.380 
the fact that this one holds five single
flowers<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.430> I<00:01:28.490> could<00:01:28.640> put<00:01:28.820> five<00:01:29.210> different

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
flowers so I could put five different

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.240 
flowers so I could put five different
labs<00:01:29.690> in<00:01:29.870> there<00:01:29.990> they<00:01:30.170> can<00:01:30.320> be<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.530> same<00:01:30.920> color

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
labs in there they can be the same color

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.770 
labs in there they can be the same color
or<00:01:31.580> different<00:01:31.910> colors<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:32.420> doesn't<00:01:32.570> make<00:01:32.720> a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
or different colors so doesn't make a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.630 
or different colors so doesn't make a
difference<00:01:32.900> whatever<00:01:33.410> you<00:01:33.650> fancy<00:01:33.830> right<00:01:34.310> now

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
difference whatever you fancy right now

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.490 
difference whatever you fancy right now
you'll<00:01:34.880> notice<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.330> tops<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.900> glass<00:01:36.080> very

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you'll notice the tops of the glass very

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.520 
you'll notice the tops of the glass very
interesting<00:01:37.040> thing<00:01:37.250> at<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.670> top<00:01:37.940> up<00:01:38.180> here

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
interesting thing at the top up here

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.140 
interesting thing at the top up here
what<00:01:39.530> you'll<00:01:39.920> notice<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:40.340> these<00:01:40.460> are<00:01:40.640> all<00:01:40.670> even

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150

what you'll notice is these are all even
okay<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:41.780> what<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:41.990> did<00:01:42.170> was<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:42.410> went<00:01:42.590> through

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
okay so what I did was I went through

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.950 
okay so what I did was I went through
and<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.190> tipped<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.850> glad<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.330> just<00:01:44.630> took<00:01:44.780> out

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
and I tipped the glad I just took out

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.410 
and I tipped the glad I just took out
that<00:01:45.260> top<00:01:45.590> part<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.910> then<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
that top part like that and then it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.030 
that top part like that and then it
doesn't<00:01:47.780> send<00:01:47.960> all<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.230> strength<00:01:48.590> up<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.800> that

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
doesn't send all the strength up to that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.640 
doesn't send all the strength up to that
flower<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.940> also<00:01:50.090> since<00:01:50.750> ethylene<00:01:51.470> up<00:01:51.560> to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
flower and it also since ethylene up to

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.020 
flower and it also since ethylene up to
the<00:01:51.740> top<00:01:51.920> that'll<00:01:52.190> help<00:01:52.310> open<00:01:52.640> up<00:01:52.700> all<00:01:52.850> those

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the top that'll help open up all those

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.520 
the top that'll help open up all those
blimps<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.870> can<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.170> how<00:01:54.260> sometimes

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
blimps so you can see how sometimes

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.020 
blimps so you can see how sometimes

definitely or Kazon could put that
together<00:02:09.550> either<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.119> were<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.360> defense<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.900> would

I would have so what I did was I made

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.090 
I would have so what I did was I made
that<00:02:13.780> last<00:02:14.020> night<00:02:14.200> though<00:02:14.350> cuz<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.860> an<00:02:14.980> old

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
that last night though cuz it's an old

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.680 
that last night though cuz it's an old
technique<00:02:15.250> my<00:02:15.490> grandpa<00:02:15.820> used<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.060> make<00:02:16.270> up<00:02:16.390> but

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
technique my grandpa used to make up but

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.750 
technique my grandpa used to make up but
you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.080> use<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.440> same<00:02:17.680> technique<00:02:18.220> because

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you can use the same technique because

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.370 
you can use the same technique because
what<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:18.970> did<00:02:19.060> was<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.450> picked<00:02:19.780> off<00:02:19.930> some<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
what I did was I picked off some of the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.770 
what I did was I picked off some of the
blossoms<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.310> what<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:21.940> did<00:02:22.150> was<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.390> cut<00:02:22.600> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
blossoms and what I did was I cut the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.780 
blossoms and what I did was I cut the
backs<00:02:23.020> off<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.620> blossoms<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.640> what

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
backs off of the blossoms and then what

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.850 
backs off of the blossoms and then what
I<00:02:24.820> do<00:02:24.940> is<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.420> put<00:02:25.990> them<00:02:26.080> together<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.770> I'm

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
I do is I just put them together so I'm

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.050 
I do is I just put them together so I'm
sticking<00:02:27.100> my<00:02:27.990> inside<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.290> other<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.970> like

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
sticking my inside the other just like

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.060 
sticking my inside the other just like
that<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.020> create<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.590> now<00:02:32.710> that's<00:02:32.860> how<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
that so I create that now that's how the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.560 
that so I create that now that's how the
center<00:02:33.490> is<00:02:33.550> created<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.030> those<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.270> glued

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
center is created and those are glued

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.660 
center is created and those are glued
together<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.590> then<00:02:35.740> we<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.130> drop<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.370> into

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
together but then we can drop that into

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.370 
together but then we can drop that into
a<00:02:36.790> base<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> well<00:02:37.810> I'm<00:02:37.900> pretty<00:02:38.080> sure<00:02:38.320> I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
a base like that well I'm pretty sure I

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.700 
a base like that well I'm pretty sure I
can<00:02:38.500> handle<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.250> yeah<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.500> way

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
can handle that one yeah in this way

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.190 
can handle that one yeah in this way
don't<00:02:42.190> forget<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.300> can<00:02:43.480> use<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
don't forget that you can use the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.130 
don't forget that you can use the
blossoms<00:02:44.740> by<00:02:45.250> themselves<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:46.810> simple

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
blossoms by themselves so it's so simple

blossoms by themselves so it's so simple
I<00:02:47.290> mean<00:02:47.410> this<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:47.800> cute<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.370> nice<00:02:48.550> this
