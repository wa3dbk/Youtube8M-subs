00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.350
 Our studio has four pieces 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:12.190
 two views 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.129
 the front and the back 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.660
 this fabric does not fray because it is a 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.789
 knitted fabric 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.530
 if it was a fraying fabric 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:28.590
 I would have to finish this shore first 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.070
 the front edge 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:37.280
 the edge of the shoulders 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.280
 both the front and the back 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.490
 for the seams we are going to make a 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.730
 seam at the armhole 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.760
 we leave the shoulder open we make a 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.370
 seam on the neck we leave open the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.940
 shoulder and we make a seam at the armhole 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.150
 this is going to be both in the forward 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 in the back we have cooked the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.260
 views we have open men 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.180
 in both 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.550
 this seam did with robert 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.380
 therefore it is a thin seam 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.680
 I would have used a straight machine 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.690
 I would have chosen a slim zig zag already 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.730
 which is an elastic fabric and the zig zag 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 Slim is an elastic seam 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.370
 I would also have to do some 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.600
 cuts before reaching the seam for 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:33.490
 that when turning around the same thing is fine 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.250
 it happened from stand to make cuts 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.180
 since we have turned them over we are going to 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.780
 sew the sides 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.320
 when cooking the side we have the side 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.920
 here and this is the part of the views 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 let's sew starting with the views 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.230
 taking care that here 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.230
 I stayed in the same position 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 and then we continue with the rest of this 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.270
 we are going to do it on both sides 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.849
 the next step is the key to being able 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.000
 finish this project and it's in the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:18.290
 shoulders here we have the dress upside down 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.150
 therefore he is entitled with right and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.590
 we are going to make a seam to join 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.590
 the front of the shoulders 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.390
 perform this posture very slowly 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.510
 always ensuring nothing else to take a 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.770
 cloth layer if you prefer you can make it 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.040
 by hand 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.220
 here raise the press fabrics with the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.510
 down to recommend the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.100
 fabric in the front we have the seam that 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.420
 we do and on the other side we have it 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.380
 open 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.590
 if we close them let's say 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.640
 everything on one side will be bulky 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.930
 so that this does not happen we need 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.250
 get to the first seam 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.250
 and open it 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.520
 once it is open let's move on 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.500
 one on one side 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.550
 and the other 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.760
 On the other side, this is how we are left 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.890
 without councils of both the part of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.890
 back as from the front 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.890
 let's see how we do sewing 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.990
 this is where you have to start sewing 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.080
 so let's start with the part of 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.080
 behind 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.230
 to be able to put the knot as I'm 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.620
 using black thread to show them the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.620
 stitch 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.330
 here we sunbathe 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 piece on this side 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.050
 we enter and leave this side 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.800
 after this side 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.030
 and said to finish if they are observed at 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.000
 pull the thread the sewing almost does not show 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.000
 and it is a seam that is very flat 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.470
 and we have the right of man and the 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.220
 reverse of man 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.710
 now we need to fix the view of the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.689
 sisa so it does not fly away we have 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.040
 two options one is to sew 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:58.180
 with the machine 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:03.070
 a bit in just in the seam and the 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.370
 another is to sew the seam margins to 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.370
 hand 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.860
 to ensure that the view does not go to 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.900
 flip while we're using it 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.900
 we can iron it though this is how it is 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:23.000
 a knit fabric to lose 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.970
 quickly ironing or sewing 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.610
 I met this little one or with a seam 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.690
 straight so it's not going to move 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.690
 around the neck 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.210
 [Applause] 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.620
 to end 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.970
 Make a hem with zig zag for 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.970
 that could be elastic 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.699
 break and with this we end 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.680
 the dress I hope this tutorial will 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.520
 It has been useful to have a good 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.520
 day bye
