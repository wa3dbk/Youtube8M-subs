00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
of tape I'm using electrical tape

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
of tape I'm using electrical tape
because<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.220> other<00:00:47.520> tape<00:00:47.700> is

because I don't know what other tape is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.210 
because I don't know what other tape is
but<00:00:48.630> basically<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.290> put<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.710> stencil

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
but basically I put my the the stencil

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.890 
but basically I put my the the stencil
down<00:00:53.400> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.880> shirt<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.450> then<00:00:54.600> there's<00:00:54.810> a

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
down on the shirt and then there's a

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.650 
down on the shirt and then there's a
piece<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.110> wood<00:00:55.820> underneath<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.240> so<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
piece of wood underneath here so it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.500 
piece of wood underneath here so it
won't<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:58.170> through<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> other<00:00:58.740> shirt<00:00:59.610> or<00:01:00.120> this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
dry it too good because then it'd be

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.790 
dry it too good because then it'd be
hard<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.819> off<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.990> here<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.260> we're

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
hard to get this off of here so we're

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.559 
hard to get this off of here so we're
gonna<00:02:24.890> head<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.459> take<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.030> tape<00:02:26.330> off<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
gonna head in take this tape off the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.840 
gonna head in take this tape off the
shirt<00:02:27.160> with<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.310> stencil<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:29.090> find<00:02:30.080> out<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.850> it

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
shirt with the stencil to find out if it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.530 
shirt with the stencil to find out if it
looks<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.209> crap<00:02:32.660> or<00:02:33.080> if<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.860> looks<00:02:34.220> good<00:02:37.540> and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
looks like crap or if it looks good and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.059 
looks like crap or if it looks good and
hopefully<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.050> looks<00:02:39.170> good<00:02:39.410> cuz<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.920> really

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
hopefully it looks good cuz I really

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.490 
hopefully it looks good cuz I really
hope<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.180> does<00:02:41.390> turn<00:02:41.690> out<00:02:41.840> really<00:02:41.959> good<00:02:44.350> if<00:02:45.350> I

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500

get this tape off of here I wish I had
my<00:02:52.190> other<00:02:52.220> tape<00:02:52.640> because<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:54.530> would<00:02:54.650> work<00:02:54.830> a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
my other tape because it would work a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
reuse it just make sure that you go

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.610 
reuse it just make sure that you go
through<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.300> where<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.510> monopods<00:03:26.989> was<00:03:27.319> glue

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
through and where the monopods was glue

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.660 
through and where the monopods was glue
that<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:28.849> get<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.870> off<00:03:30.319> of<00:03:30.380> there<00:03:30.709> but<00:03:31.489> this
