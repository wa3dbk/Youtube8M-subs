didn't quite make the cut is by a guy
called<00:03:54.340> Hamby<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.810> an<00:03:55.959> incredibly

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
called Hamby and this is an incredibly

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.470 
called Hamby and this is an incredibly
simple<00:03:56.770> concept<00:03:57.520> but<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.910> think<00:03:58.090> he's<00:03:58.209> pulled

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
simple concept but I think he's pulled

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:07.140 
simple concept but I think he's pulled
it<00:03:58.569> off<00:03:58.690> very<00:03:58.930> well<00:03:59.110> a<00:04:05.670> lot<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.730> people<00:04:07.000> really

like<00:04:07.390> that<00:04:07.600> one<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:07.989> didn't<00:04:08.200> quite<00:04:08.350> make

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
like that one but it didn't quite make

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.100 
like that one but it didn't quite make

the hardest one to make so this was

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.460 
the hardest one to make so this was
between<00:04:39.340> two<00:04:39.760> entries<00:04:40.270> both<00:04:40.690> of<00:04:40.870> which<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.200> very

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
between two entries both of which a very

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.580 
between two entries both of which a very
high<00:04:41.710> quality<00:04:42.060> very<00:04:43.060> different<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:44.080> styles

high quality very different in styles
but<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.340> was<00:04:45.850> such<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.090> hard<00:04:46.360> decision<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:47.229> make

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
but it was such a hard decision to make

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.090

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
very minimalistic feel to that and I

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.480 
very minimalistic feel to that and I
think<00:04:59.899> it<00:05:00.050> really<00:05:00.259> suits<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.949> style<00:05:01.069> of<00:05:01.369> my
