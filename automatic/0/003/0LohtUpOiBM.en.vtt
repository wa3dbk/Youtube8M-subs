going to be showing you five tips or
things<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.040> do<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.339> improve<00:00:05.640> your

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
things you can do to improve your

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.610 
things you can do to improve your
mechanics<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.450> what<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.930> do<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.319> warm<00:00:07.470> up

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
mechanics and what I do to warm up

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.470 
mechanics and what I do to warm up
before<00:00:07.950> games<00:00:08.220> or<00:00:08.460> if<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.760> feel<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.000> little<00:00:09.240> bit

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
before games or if I feel a little bit

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.749 
before games or if I feel a little bit
rusty<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.349> number<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:11.099> not<00:00:11.309> play<00:00:11.550> with

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
rusty so number one do not play with

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.610 
rusty so number one do not play with
cold<00:00:12.030> hands<00:00:12.420> now<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:12.990> sounds<00:00:13.290> really<00:00:13.469> dumb

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
cold hands now this sounds really dumb

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.709 
cold hands now this sounds really dumb
but<00:00:13.950> honestly<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.610> cannot<00:00:15.030> play<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.269> cold

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
but honestly you cannot play with cold

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.870 
but honestly you cannot play with cold
hands<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.560> promise<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.460> will<00:00:17.550> affect

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
hands and I promise you it will affect

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.460 
hands and I promise you it will affect
your<00:00:18.029> performance<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.109> won't<00:00:19.260> really

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
your performance now you won't really

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.080 
your performance now you won't really
notice<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> start<00:00:20.369> with<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:20.789> when<00:00:20.970> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
notice it to start with but when it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.670 
notice it to start with but when it
comes<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.539> make<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.869> split-second<00:00:22.650> decision

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
comes to make a split-second decision

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
comes to make a split-second decision
and<00:00:23.189> react<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.480> fast<00:00:24.720> as

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and react to you what make it as fast as

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.570 
and react to you what make it as fast as
you<00:00:25.019> normally<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.500> now<00:00:25.920> obviously<00:00:26.340> dealing

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you normally do now obviously dealing

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
you normally do now obviously dealing
with<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.180> different<00:00:27.599> from<00:00:27.689> person<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
with this is different from person to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
with this is different from person to
person<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.250> pull<00:00:29.429> my<00:00:29.580> sleeves<00:00:29.880> over

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
person but I just pull my sleeves over

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
person but I just pull my sleeves over
my<00:00:30.420> hands<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.900> rub<00:00:31.050> them<00:00:31.199> together<00:00:31.349> until<00:00:31.980> they

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
my hands I rub them together until they

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.690 
my hands I rub them together until they
feel<00:00:32.279> warm

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
feel warm

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
feel warm
so<00:00:33.090> number<00:00:33.390> two<00:00:33.570> practice<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.260> csing<00:00:34.800> now

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so number two practice you're csing now

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.080 
so number two practice you're csing now
this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.340> probably<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> most

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this is probably one of the most

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060 
this is probably one of the most
important<00:00:36.809> aspects<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> game<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
important aspects to the game and the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
important aspects to the game and the
best<00:00:38.280> way<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> improving<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.629> by

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
best way of improving is just by

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.170 
best way of improving is just by
practicing<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.770> way<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.969> go

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
practicing the way I do this is I go

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
practicing the way I do this is I go
into<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.450> custom<00:00:42.870> game<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.260> choose<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> champion

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
into a custom game I choose a champion

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
into a custom game I choose a champion
I'm<00:00:44.370> likely<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> play<00:00:45.120> after<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.600> done

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
I'm likely to play after I'm done

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.270 
I'm likely to play after I'm done
warming<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.800> try<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.160> hit

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
warming up and then I try and hit

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.430 
warming up and then I try and hit
perfect<00:00:47.700> CS<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> personally<00:00:48.960> keep<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.260> count

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
perfect CS now I personally keep a count

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.950 
perfect CS now I personally keep a count
of<00:00:49.649> how<00:00:49.829> many<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.100> miss<00:00:50.640> each<00:00:50.879> wave<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.750> try

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of how many I miss each wave and I try

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.049 
of how many I miss each wave and I try
to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.559> next<00:00:52.829> wave<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.610> miss<00:00:53.789> two

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to be to the next wave so if I miss two

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
to be to the next wave so if I miss two
CS<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:55.050> wave<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.620> need<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.920> make

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
CS in the first wave then I need to make

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
CS in the first wave then I need to make
sure<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.489> only<00:00:56.670> miss<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.239> less<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
sure that I only miss one or less in the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
sure that I only miss one or less in the
next<00:00:58.109> wave<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> real<00:00:59.219> games<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.910> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
next wave now in real games is going to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
next wave now in real games is going to
be<00:01:00.090> impossible<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.140> perfect<00:01:01.590> CS<00:01:01.859> because

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
be impossible to get perfect CS because

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
be impossible to get perfect CS because
you'll<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.489> fighting<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.300> you'll<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.629> away

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you'll be fighting or you'll be away

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
you'll be fighting or you'll be away
from<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.170> wave<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> focus

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
from the wave and so you want to focus

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
from the wave and so you want to focus
on<00:01:05.850> getting<00:01:05.909> every<00:01:06.659> CS<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.229> possible<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
on getting every CS that is possible to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
on getting every CS that is possible to
get<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> mean<00:01:08.790> by<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.479> say

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
get now what I mean by this is that say

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.630 
get now what I mean by this is that say
if<00:01:10.229> you're<00:01:10.380> being<00:01:10.530> zoned<00:01:10.830> two<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> six

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
if you're being zoned two out of the six

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
if you're being zoned two out of the six
minions<00:01:12.270> may<00:01:12.479> die<00:01:12.689> before<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.350> reach<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
minions may die before they reach you

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
minions may die before they reach you
but<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> leaves<00:01:14.460> four<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.570> reach<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
but that leaves four that do reach you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.780 
but that leaves four that do reach you
and<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.500> need<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> those<00:01:17.430> four

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and so you need to get all of those four

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
and so you need to get all of those four
now<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> main<00:01:18.509> things<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> focus<00:01:19.259> on

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
now the main things you want to focus on

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.950 
now the main things you want to focus on
when<00:01:19.920> csing<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.700> who<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.479> minions<00:01:21.810> are

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
when csing are who your minions are

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
when csing are who your minions are
attacking<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.680> enemy<00:01:23.220> minions<00:01:23.610> health

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
attacking and the enemy minions health

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
attacking and the enemy minions health
now<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> will<00:01:24.659> let<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> figure<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.140> which

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
now this will let you figure out which

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.380 
now this will let you figure out which
minion<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> die<00:01:26.490> first<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
minion is going to die first and it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
minion is going to die first and it
should<00:01:27.600> let<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> hit<00:01:28.080> every<00:01:28.470> CS<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.130> also

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
should let you hit every CS but also

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
should let you hit every CS but also
don't<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.880> afraid<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.390> use<00:01:30.420> low<00:01:30.750> mana<00:01:30.990> cost

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't be afraid to use low mana cost

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
don't be afraid to use low mana cost
abilities<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.130> secure<00:01:32.520> CS<00:01:32.820> you'd<00:01:33.060> otherwise

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
abilities to secure CS you'd otherwise

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.810 
abilities to secure CS you'd otherwise
miss<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.439> number<00:01:34.740> three<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.250> comfortable

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
miss now number three be comfortable

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
miss now number three be comfortable
attack<00:01:36.090> moving<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.020> those<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.470> don't

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
attack moving now for those of you don't

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
attack moving now for those of you don't
know<00:01:37.950> what<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.299> issuing<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
know what this is it's just issuing a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
know what this is it's just issuing a
movement<00:01:40.079> command<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.829> usual<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.549> instead

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
movement command like usual but instead

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.219 
movement command like usual but instead
you'll<00:01:42.150> attack<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> first<00:01:42.840> thing<00:01:43.110> you

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you'll attack the first thing you

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.469 
you'll attack the first thing you
encounter<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> way<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> personally<00:01:45.149> do

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
encounter on the way now I personally do

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.780 
encounter on the way now I personally do
this<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.810> pressing<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.159> clicking<00:01:47.490> as

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this by pressing a and then clicking as

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
this by pressing a and then clicking as
usual<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> bunch<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.560> different

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
usual but there are a bunch of different

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
usual but there are a bunch of different
ways<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.280> set<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.570> doing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
ways to set this up and I will be doing

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.929 
ways to set this up and I will be doing
an<00:01:51.930> in-depth<00:01:52.439> video<00:01:52.770> about<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.250> soon<00:01:53.460> now

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
an in-depth video about this soon now

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.249 
an in-depth video about this soon now
it's<00:01:54.180> best<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.750> when<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.079> being

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it's best to use this when you're being

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.139 
it's best to use this when you're being
chased<00:01:55.320> by<00:01:55.799> someone<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.430> remember<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> it's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
chased by someone but remember that it's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.030 
chased by someone but remember that it's
going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> attack<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> closest<00:01:58.229> target<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.890> if

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to attack the closest target so if

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.530 
going to attack the closest target so if
minions<00:01:59.399> are<00:01:59.579> around<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.180> may<00:02:00.329> end<00:02:00.479> up

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
minions are around you may end up

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.359 
minions are around you may end up
attacking<00:02:00.990> them<00:02:01.110> insert<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> enemy<00:02:01.920> champion

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
attacking them insert the enemy champion

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.100 
attacking them insert the enemy champion
now<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.180> ways<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.899> really

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
now there are two ways that I can really

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.469 
now there are two ways that I can really
practice<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.100> first<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.700> by<00:02:05.969> csing

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
practice this the first it just by csing

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.419 
practice this the first it just by csing
using<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.960> TAC<00:02:07.170> move<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.890> sounds<00:02:08.220> really

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
using a TAC move now this sounds really

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
using a TAC move now this sounds really
odd<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.330> actually<00:02:09.539> bring<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
odd but you can actually bring up the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
odd but you can actually bring up the
attack<00:02:10.470> move<00:02:10.649> cursor<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.340> click<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> minion

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
attack move cursor and click on a minion

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
attack move cursor and click on a minion
to<00:02:12.480> attack<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to attack that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380 
to attack that
now<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> exactly<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> same<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.000> clicking

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
now this is exactly the same as clicking

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.940 
now this is exactly the same as clicking
on<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.780> minion<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.380> gets<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> used<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
on the minion but it gets you used to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.950 
on the minion but it gets you used to
pressing<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.550> before<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.210> attack<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> it's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
pressing a before you attack and it's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.360 
pressing a before you attack and it's
going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.200> improve<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.500> attack<00:02:19.830> moving<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
going to improve your attack moving to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.800 
going to improve your attack moving to
so<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.940> second<00:02:21.240> way<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.390> while<00:02:21.660> you're

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
so the second way is while you're

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.840 
so the second way is while you're
practicing<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.320> csing<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:22.890> well<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.550> as<00:02:23.820> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
practicing your csing as well and as a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.490 
practicing your csing as well and as a
wave<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.360> moving<00:02:24.540> towards<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> you're<00:02:25.350> just

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
wave is moving towards you you're just

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.140 
wave is moving towards you you're just
going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.680> attack<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:25.980> backwards<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:27.000> is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
going to attack with backwards this is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.180 
going to attack with backwards this is
why<00:02:27.270> are<00:02:27.540> usually<00:02:27.960> just<00:02:28.260> by<00:02:28.410> attack<00:02:28.710> speed<00:02:28.980> in

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
why are usually just by attack speed in

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
why are usually just by attack speed in
my<00:02:29.370> custom<00:02:29.790> games<00:02:30.030> first<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.930> makes<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
my custom games first off it makes the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.750 
my custom games first off it makes the
icing<00:02:31.560> harder<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.400> concentrate

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
icing harder so you have to concentrate

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.610 
icing harder so you have to concentrate
more<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.450> also<00:02:33.630> makes<00:02:34.080> attack<00:02:34.380> moving

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
more but it also makes attack moving

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.860 
more but it also makes attack moving
easier<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> practice<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:36.330> number<00:02:36.630> four

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
easier to practice so number four

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.720 
easier to practice so number four
practice<00:02:37.380> our<00:02:37.560> flashes<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.190> most<00:02:38.370> people

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
practice our flashes so that most people

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 
practice our flashes so that most people
fail<00:02:38.940> now<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> pick<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> ones<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.170> are<00:02:40.260> pretty

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
fail now I pick the ones that are pretty

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.530 
fail now I pick the ones that are pretty
tough<00:02:40.709> around<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.370> lane<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.300> more

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
tough around my lane and this is more

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.300 
tough around my lane and this is more

opinion<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> wall<00:02:45.600> next<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.930> try<00:02:46.200> brush<00:02:46.470> is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
opinion so the wall next to try brush is

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.130 
opinion so the wall next to try brush is
notoriously<00:02:47.459> people<00:02:48.090> failing<00:02:48.420> their<00:02:48.690> flashes

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
notoriously people failing their flashes

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.720 
notoriously people failing their flashes
and<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.500> every<00:02:49.920> time<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.220> flash<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.610> off

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and so every time you flash is off

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940 
and so every time you flash is off
cooldown<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.480> go<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.959> flash<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:52.890> you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
cooldown just go and flash it now you

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.560 
cooldown just go and flash it now you
need<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.280> stand<00:02:53.489> right<00:02:53.580> next<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> wall<00:02:54.390> to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
need to stand right next to the wall to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.570 
need to stand right next to the wall to
pull<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.989> off<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.410> by<00:02:55.739> doing<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.160> over<00:02:56.250> and

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
pull it off and by doing it over and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.920 
pull it off and by doing it over and
over<00:02:56.820> you're<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.209> be<00:02:57.300> less<00:02:57.510> likely<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
over you're going to be less likely to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.170 
over you're going to be less likely to
panic<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.530> games<00:02:58.770> when<00:02:59.010> having<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
panic in games when having to do it so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.790 
panic in games when having to do it so
number<00:03:00.450> five<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.959> last<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.320> all<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.739> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
number five and last of all is going to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.620 
number five and last of all is going to
be<00:03:01.890> practicing<00:03:02.310> your<00:03:02.459> mouse<00:03:02.760> control<00:03:03.239> now

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
be practicing your mouse control now

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270 
be practicing your mouse control now
this<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.930> be<00:03:03.959> done<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.290> league<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.739> outside

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
this can be done in league and outside

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040 
this can be done in league and outside
so<00:03:05.520> I'll<00:03:05.640> go<00:03:05.790> over<00:03:05.940> how<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.720> custom

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
so I'll go over how I do it in a custom

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.110 
so I'll go over how I do it in a custom
game<00:03:07.200> first<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.100> put<00:03:08.400> two<00:03:08.610> wards<00:03:08.910> either

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
game first so I put two wards either

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.940 
game first so I put two wards either
side<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.660> try<00:03:09.900> brush<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.739> see

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
side of the try brush like you can see

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.560 
side of the try brush like you can see
on<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> screen<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.640> then<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.000> click<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.330> either

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570
