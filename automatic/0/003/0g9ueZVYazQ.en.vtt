hey<00:00:02.770> this<00:00:02.950> is<00:00:03.070> Johnny<00:00:03.370> I'm<00:00:03.550> checking<00:00:03.909> out<00:00:04.180> the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:04.420 
hey this is Johnny I'm checking out the

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.710 
hey this is Johnny I'm checking out the
new<00:00:04.660> wireless<00:00:05.439> microphone<00:00:06.040> system<00:00:06.729> by<00:00:07.180> Sony

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
new wireless microphone system by Sony

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.030 
new wireless microphone system by Sony
and<00:00:08.080> I'll<00:00:08.170> tell<00:00:08.349> you<00:00:08.410> I'm<00:00:08.530> pretty<00:00:08.769> excited

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
and I'll tell you I'm pretty excited

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.190 
and I'll tell you I'm pretty excited
about<00:00:09.250> this<00:00:09.610> because<00:00:10.059> it's<00:00:10.480> the<00:00:10.660> first<00:00:10.870> sign

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
about this because it's the first sign

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.530 
about this because it's the first sign
that<00:00:11.230> it's<00:00:11.679> kind<00:00:11.919> of<00:00:11.980> like<00:00:12.070> in<00:00:12.669> that<00:00:12.969> price

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
that it's kind of like in that price

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.560 
that it's kind of like in that price
range<00:00:13.870> where<00:00:14.530> it's<00:00:15.370> not<00:00:15.580> too<00:00:15.820> expensive<00:00:16.240> but

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
range where it's not too expensive but

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.200 
range where it's not too expensive but
it's<00:00:16.690> a<00:00:16.780> digital<00:00:17.020> hybrid<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:18.490> for<00:00:18.760> many<00:00:18.939> years

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
it's a digital hybrid so for many years

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.759 
it's a digital hybrid so for many years
I've<00:00:19.449> used<00:00:19.480> other<00:00:19.840> stuff<00:00:20.199> I've<00:00:20.380> actually<00:00:20.560> used

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
I've used other stuff I've actually used

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.220 
I've used other stuff I've actually used
these<00:00:21.189> and<00:00:21.519> had<00:00:22.060> good<00:00:22.269> results<00:00:22.480> with<00:00:22.929> it<00:00:22.960> but

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
these and had good results with it but

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.320 
these and had good results with it but
this<00:00:23.859> actually<00:00:24.369> I<00:00:24.400> haven't<00:00:24.550> used<00:00:24.849> I<00:00:24.970> use<00:00:25.150> their

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
this actually I haven't used I use their

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.400 
this actually I haven't used I use their
I<00:00:25.599> guess<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.170> one<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.500> was<00:00:26.619> came<00:00:26.830> before<00:00:26.980> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I guess the one that was came before it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.839 
I guess the one that was came before it
uwp<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:29.619> go<00:00:29.769> ahead<00:00:29.830> and<00:00:30.039> tell<00:00:30.250> me<00:00:30.369> all<00:00:30.670> about

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
uwp so go ahead and tell me all about

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.420 
uwp so go ahead and tell me all about
this<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.539> why<00:00:31.750> I<00:00:31.779> love<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.380> so<00:00:32.410> much<00:00:32.710> I'll<00:00:33.370> tell

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
this and why I love it so much I'll tell

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.590 
this and why I love it so much I'll tell
you<00:00:33.820> but<00:00:34.150> here<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:34.450> go

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
you but here we go

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.280 
you but here we go
sure<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.650> is<00:00:35.860> our<00:00:36.070> UWPD<00:00:37.060> series<00:00:37.780> product

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
sure this is our UWPD series product

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.170 
sure this is our UWPD series product
that<00:00:38.410> we're<00:00:38.530> just<00:00:38.800> introducing<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.670> it's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
that we're just introducing and it's

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.900 
that we're just introducing and it's
replacing<00:00:40.900> our<00:00:41.020> previous<00:00:41.500> uwp<00:00:42.190> generation<00:00:42.790> of

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
replacing our previous uwp generation of

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.150 
replacing our previous uwp generation of
products<00:00:43.420> this<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.320> using<00:00:44.680> as<00:00:44.830> you<00:00:44.950> said

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
products this is using as you said

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.070 
products this is using as you said
digital<00:00:45.580> hybrid<00:00:45.940> technology<00:00:46.570> so<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:46.900> has<00:00:47.050> a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
digital hybrid technology so it has a

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.980 
digital hybrid technology so it has a
DSP<00:00:47.730> located<00:00:48.730> in<00:00:48.850> both<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.180> transmitter<00:00:49.600> and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
DSP located in both the transmitter and

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.990 
DSP located in both the transmitter and
the<00:00:50.350> receiver<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:50.860> are<00:00:51.130> used<00:00:51.340> for<00:00:51.610> digital

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
the receiver that are used for digital

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.810 
the receiver that are used for digital
processing<00:00:52.870> for<00:00:53.380> companding<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.490> it's<00:00:54.640> using

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
processing for companding so it's using

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.450 
processing for companding so it's using
conventional<00:00:55.270> FM<00:00:55.870> modulation<00:00:56.380> just<00:00:57.130> like<00:00:57.280> an

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
conventional FM modulation just like an

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.430 
conventional FM modulation just like an
analog<00:00:57.670> wireless<00:00:58.240> system<00:00:58.630> but<00:00:59.050> having<00:00:59.320> the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
analog wireless system but having the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.590 
analog wireless system but having the
benefits<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.070> using<00:01:00.250> DSP<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.210> improving

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
benefits of using DSP and improving

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.750 
benefits of using DSP and improving
sound<00:01:01.900> quality<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.980> other<00:01:03.130> great<00:01:03.490> thing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
sound quality the other great thing

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.419 
sound quality the other great thing
about<00:01:03.790> it<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.420> that<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.900> has<00:01:04.930> 72<00:01:05.680> megahertz<00:01:06.219> of

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:06.429 
about it is that it has 72 megahertz of

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:09.149 
about it is that it has 72 megahertz of
bandwidth<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:06.969> it<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:07.899> our<00:01:08.259> previous<00:01:08.679> products

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
bandwidth to it so our previous products

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.190 
bandwidth to it so our previous products
had<00:01:09.340> 24<00:01:09.909> megahertz<00:01:10.359> of<00:01:10.509> bandwidth<00:01:10.869> this

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
had 24 megahertz of bandwidth this

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.709 
had 24 megahertz of bandwidth this
triples<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.039> overall<00:01:12.820> number<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.420> RF

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
triples the overall number of RF

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.749 
triples the overall number of RF
frequencies<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.500> are<00:01:14.560> available<00:01:14.859> to<00:01:15.369> select

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
frequencies that are available to select

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.270 
frequencies that are available to select
from<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:17.170> I'm<00:01:17.229> gonna<00:01:17.320> tell<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.799> some<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.130> the

from well I'm gonna tell you some of the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.160 
from well I'm gonna tell you some of the
features<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.909> liked<00:01:19.179> about<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.570> already

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
features that I liked about it already

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.249 
features that I liked about it already
from<00:01:20.770> using<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.490> Sony<00:01:21.969> or<00:01:22.329> not<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.840> one<00:01:23.109> but

phone's something that it didn't have
before<00:01:44.829> that<00:01:45.609> I<00:01:45.850> just<00:01:45.939> noticed<00:01:46.630> which<00:01:46.810> I'm

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
before that I just noticed which I'm

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.069 
before that I just noticed which I'm
kind<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:47.829> excited<00:01:48.310> about<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.700> these<00:01:49.600> bottom

wow I still love the rug ability of it I
love<00:01:57.819> the<00:01:57.939> fact<00:01:58.209> that<00:01:58.329> you<00:01:58.630> can<00:01:58.780> put<00:01:58.959> the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
love the fact that you can put the

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.419 
love the fact that you can put the
batteries<00:01:59.439> in<00:01:59.469> and<00:01:59.679> they're<00:01:59.979> gonna<00:02:00.159> fall<00:02:00.369> out

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
batteries in and they're gonna fall out

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.539 
batteries in and they're gonna fall out
it's<00:02:00.789> easy<00:02:01.060> but<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.630> feels<00:02:02.079> expensive<00:02:02.740> tell<00:02:03.429> me

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
it's easy but it feels expensive tell me

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.179 
it's easy but it feels expensive tell me
a<00:02:03.579> little<00:02:03.729> bit<00:02:03.909> about<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.270> USB<00:02:04.600> sure<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.950> USB

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
a little bit about that USB sure the USB

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.219 
a little bit about that USB sure the USB
port<00:02:06.639> has<00:02:06.850> several<00:02:07.149> purposes<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.840> mean<00:02:08.020> one<00:02:08.200> is

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
port has several purposes I mean one is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.620 
port has several purposes I mean one is
that<00:02:08.679> allows<00:02:08.950> us<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.250> apply<00:02:09.610> firmware<00:02:10.240> updates

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
that allows us to apply firmware updates

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.990 
that allows us to apply firmware updates
on<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.930> unit<00:02:11.230> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
on the unit and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.910 
on the unit and
in<00:02:14.000> addition<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.659> it<00:02:14.900> allows<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.470> us<00:02:15.590> be

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
in addition to that it allows for us be

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.240 
in addition to that it allows for us be
powering<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.209> can<00:02:17.599> take<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.379> USB<00:02:19.040> power

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
powering so I can take a USB power

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.670 
powering so I can take a USB power
device<00:02:19.760> maybe<00:02:20.299> it's<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.659> lithium<00:02:21.019> ion<00:02:21.290> battery

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
device maybe it's a lithium ion battery

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.309 
device maybe it's a lithium ion battery
that<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.340> externally<00:02:23.120> recharged<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:24.140> can

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
that can be externally recharged you can

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.289 
that can be externally recharged you can
use<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.650> as<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> power<00:02:25.220> source<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.209> you

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
use that as a power source so if you

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.880 
use that as a power source so if you
needed<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.659> have<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.930> wireless<00:02:27.230> system<00:02:27.590> that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
needed to have a wireless system that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.250 
needed to have a wireless system that
runs<00:02:28.159> all<00:02:28.400> day<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.879> batteries<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.870> power

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
runs all day on batteries you can power

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.770 
runs all day on batteries you can power
it<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:30.739> an<00:02:30.890> external<00:02:31.549> USB<00:02:31.909> power<00:02:32.390> source

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
