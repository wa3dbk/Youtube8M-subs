00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.430 
that's very amusing indeed very good
work<00:01:56.099> and<00:01:56.490> also<00:01:56.819> my<00:01:56.940> friends<00:01:57.270> minecraft<00:01:57.720> pg5

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
work and also my friends minecraft pg5

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.100 
work and also my friends minecraft pg5
have<00:01:58.830> created<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.580> dropper<00:02:00.090> hopper<00:02:00.569> sorting

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
have created a dropper hopper sorting

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.680 
have created a dropper hopper sorting
system<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:02.039> is<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:03.000> cool<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
system which is really really cool and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.139 
system which is really really cool and
you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.840> expand<00:02:04.709> it<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.700> seems<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.119> be

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you can expand it because it seems to be

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.690 
you can expand it because it seems to be
modular<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.649> basically<00:02:07.800> sort<00:02:08.429> all

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
modular so it can basically sort all

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.720 
modular so it can basically sort all
your<00:02:09.000> items<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:09.959> chest<00:02:10.349> into<00:02:11.160> lots<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
your items from one chest into lots of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030 
your items from one chest into lots of
different<00:02:12.120> chests<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.470> should<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.709> very

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
different chests so that should be very

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.920 
different chests so that should be very
useful<00:02:14.130> indeed<00:02:14.730> lets<00:02:15.450> us<00:02:15.599> know<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.900> the
