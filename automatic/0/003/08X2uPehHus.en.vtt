00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
rubber membrane is a scribe Center in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.650 
rubber membrane is a scribe Center in
each<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.170> show<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.160> there<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.480> can

see that little crack you can see that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.529 
see that little crack you can see that
and<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.800> another<00:00:50.160> little<00:00:50.340> crack<00:00:50.789> right

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and there is another little crack right

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.029 
and there is another little crack right

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that was the up and down buttons

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
that was the up and down buttons
amazingly<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.920> a/b<00:01:08.310> buttons<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:09.119> look

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
amazingly the a/b buttons they look

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
amazingly the a/b buttons they look
pretty<00:01:09.630> good<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.560> membrane<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
pretty good the membrane there on the

pretty good the membrane there on the
the<00:01:11.880> rubber<00:01:12.030> part<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> B<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:12.810> looks

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
the rubber part on the a B it looks

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.140 
the rubber part on the a B it looks
pretty<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> did<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.000> knew<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pretty good so what I did was I knew I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.130 
pretty good so what I did was I knew I
needed<00:01:15.270> another<00:01:15.690> one<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.310> parts<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
needed another one of these parts so I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
needed another one of these parts so I
went<00:01:19.640> scavenging<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:22.530> found<00:01:23.310> another

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
went scavenging and I found another

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
went scavenging and I found another
number<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.149> controller<00:01:24.630> pulled<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.770> apart

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
number one controller pulled it apart

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.680 
number one controller pulled it apart
but<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.759> no<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.780> even<00:01:28.110> worse<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> Chuck<00:01:30.479> that

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
but no no it's even worse so Chuck that

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.160 
but no no it's even worse so Chuck that
idea<00:01:32.060> then<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> came<00:01:33.210> across<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:35.070> nice
