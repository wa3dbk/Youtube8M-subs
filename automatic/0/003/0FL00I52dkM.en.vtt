if<00:00:00.680> 2304<00:00:01.680> and<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.159> B<00:00:02.340> equals<00:00:02.730> negative<00:00:02.879> 6<00:00:03.210> 29<00:00:03.600> 420

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
if 2304 and a B equals negative 6 29 420

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.160 
if 2304 and a B equals negative 6 29 420
to<00:00:04.589> find<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.310> matrix<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.759> so<00:00:06.420> how<00:00:06.839> are<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.020> going

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
to find the matrix a so how are we going

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.930 
to find the matrix a so how are we going
to<00:00:07.259> do<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.589> right<00:00:07.799> we<00:00:07.859> don't<00:00:08.189> know<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> is

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
to do this right we don't know what a is

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.430 
to do this right we don't know what a is
we<00:00:09.120> know<00:00:09.269> what<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> B<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:09.960> know<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.290> as

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
we know what a B is we know it be as

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680 
we know what a B is we know it be as
well<00:00:10.650> notice<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:12.000> create<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.269> game<00:00:12.420> plan

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
well notice we can create a game plan

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.609 
well notice we can create a game plan
like<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.469> B<00:00:13.980> equals<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.560> kind<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
like this a B equals a be kind of

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160 
like this a B equals a be kind of
obvious<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.640> true<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.900> if<00:00:19.140> we

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
obvious but it's true right so if we

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620 
obvious but it's true right so if we
came<00:00:19.470> along<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.100> could<00:00:20.250> knock<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.880> be

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
came along we could knock out that be

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.420 
came along we could knock out that be
with<00:00:22.170> B<00:00:22.410> inverse<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.250> could<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.869> B

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
with B inverse so we could have a B

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.480 
with B inverse so we could have a B
equals<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.730> B<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.990> then<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.920> come<00:00:29.099> along<00:00:29.340> when

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
equals a B and then we come along when

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.389 
equals a B and then we come along when
we<00:00:29.609> hit<00:00:29.789> with<00:00:29.939> B<00:00:30.300> inverse<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.199> both<00:00:31.619> sides<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
we hit with B inverse on both sides and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
we hit with B inverse on both sides and
now<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.300> could<00:00:33.540> rewrite<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:36.350> equals

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
now we could rewrite this as a equals

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470 
now we could rewrite this as a equals
well<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.370> cancel<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> right

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
well we can cancel out to a on the right

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.910 
well we can cancel out to a on the right
side<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.050> could<00:00:40.170> also<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:40.710> just

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
side but we could also see there's just

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.279 
side but we could also see there's just
a<00:00:41.040> B<00:00:42.500> times<00:00:43.500> B<00:00:44.010> inverse<00:00:45.079> hey<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.760> B<00:00:48.289> we

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
a B times B inverse hey we know a B we

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.490 
a B times B inverse hey we know a B we
know<00:00:49.649> B<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> B<00:00:51.809> inverse<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
know B and so if there is a B inverse we

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.250 
know B and so if there is a B inverse we
can<00:00:52.649> figure<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
can figure out what it is from our be so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
can figure out what it is from our be so
our<00:00:55.440> first<00:00:55.680> step<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.160> figure<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:57.030> B

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
our first step is figure out what B

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
our first step is figure out what B
inverse<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:59.070> once<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> B

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
inverse is and then once we know it B

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
inverse is and then once we know it B
inverse<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.960> B<00:01:01.140> times<00:01:01.590> B

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
inverse is we just have a B times B

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.149 
inverse is we just have a B times B
inverse<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.399> we'll<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.789> our<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> that's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inverse and we'll have our a so that's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.609 
inverse and we'll have our a so that's
our<00:01:05.600> theoretical<00:01:06.600> understanding<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
our theoretical understanding now it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
our theoretical understanding now it's
time<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.100> arithmetic<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.270> B

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
time just do the arithmetic so if B

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.700 
time just do the arithmetic so if B
equals<00:01:09.869> negative<00:01:10.020> 2<00:01:10.260> 304<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.369> B<00:01:11.760> inverse

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
equals negative 2 304 then B inverse

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
equals negative 2 304 then B inverse
equals<00:01:13.710> 1<00:01:14.070> over<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.640> determinant<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.330> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
equals 1 over the determinant which is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
equals 1 over the determinant which is
ad<00:01:15.840> minus<00:01:16.350> BC<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.340> negative<00:01:18.090> 2<00:01:18.270> times<00:01:18.540> 4<00:01:19.140> minus

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
ad minus BC so negative 2 times 4 minus

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.390 
ad minus BC so negative 2 times 4 minus
zero<00:01:20.310> times<00:01:20.610> 3<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:21.630> negative<00:01:21.960> 8<00:01:22.400> times

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
zero times 3 so that's negative 8 times

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
zero times 3 so that's negative 8 times
we<00:01:24.330> flip<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> location<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> main

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
we flip the location of the main

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
we flip the location of the main
diagonal<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.090> put<00:01:27.240> negatives<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
diagonal and then we put negatives on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270 
diagonal and then we put negatives on
the<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.140> ones<00:01:28.409> negative<00:01:28.619> 3<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.040> negative

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the other ones negative 3 and negative

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
the other ones negative 3 and negative
zero<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.880> write<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.299> 0<00:01:30.659> simplify

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
zero we can write as just 0 simplify

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
zero we can write as just 0 simplify
that<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.369> bit<00:01:32.520> too<00:01:32.700> negative<00:01:33.329> 18

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that just a little bit too negative 18

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
that just a little bit too negative 18
times<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.729> negative<00:01:36.689> 3<00:01:36.990> 0<00:01:37.680> negative<00:01:38.250> 2<00:01:38.460> great

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
times for negative 3 0 negative 2 great

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.469 
times for negative 3 0 negative 2 great
so<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.360> we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so at this point we know from what we

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.219 
so at this point we know from what we
showed<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.590> equal<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:47.040> B<00:01:48.229> times

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
showed here that a is equal to a B times

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.120 
showed here that a is equal to a B times
B<00:01:49.680> inverse<00:01:50.399> well<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.200> B<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.210> negative<00:01:54.210> 6

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
B inverse well we know a B is negative 6

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:04.819 
B inverse well we know a B is negative 6
29<00:01:56.540> 4<00:01:57.799> 22<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.180> B<00:02:00.180> inverse<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.930> negative<00:02:01.799> 18<00:02:03.829> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
29 4 22 and B inverse is negative 18 so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.859 
29 4 22 and B inverse is negative 18 so
times<00:02:05.399> negative<00:02:05.790> 18<00:02:06.860> for<00:02:07.910> negative<00:02:08.910> 3<00:02:09.209> 0

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
times negative 18 for negative 3 0

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.550 
times negative 18 for negative 3 0
negative<00:02:10.440> 2<00:02:11.300> so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
negative 2 so

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.780 
negative 2 so
I<00:02:12.590> think<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:12.980> easier<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.459> bring<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
I think it's easier to bring the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.339 
I think it's easier to bring the
fraction<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.270> afterwards<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:14.930> let's<00:02:15.110> pull

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
fraction and afterwards so let's pull

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.900 
fraction and afterwards so let's pull
the<00:02:15.470> fraction<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.069> front<00:02:16.340> right<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
the fraction to the front right the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.820 
the fraction to the front right the
fraction<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.140> scalar<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:18.739> it's

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
fraction there is just a scalar so it's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.440 
fraction there is just a scalar so it's
just<00:02:18.890> going<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.099> scale<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> matrix<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:20.330> can

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
just going to scale the matrix so we can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.120 
just going to scale the matrix so we can
scale<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.780> matrix<00:02:21.110> anytime<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.650> want<00:02:21.950> let's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
scale the matrix anytime we want let's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.500 
scale the matrix anytime we want let's
just<00:02:22.280> pull<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.580> out<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> front<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.330> we<00:02:23.390> can

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
just pull it out to the front so we can

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.030 
just pull it out to the front so we can
have<00:02:23.599> our<00:02:23.690> matrices<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.770> their

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
have our matrices do their

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.760 
have our matrices do their
multiplication<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.510> we've<00:02:26.630> got<00:02:26.780> negative<00:02:27.230> 6

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
multiplication so we've got negative 6

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.710 
multiplication so we've got negative 6
29<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:29.620> 22<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:33.080> negative<00:02:33.890> 3<00:02:34.220> 0<00:02:34.819> negative<00:02:35.390> 2

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
29 for 22 for negative 3 0 negative 2

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.140 
29 for 22 for negative 3 0 negative 2
okay<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:39.280> still<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.310> fraction<00:02:40.880> up<00:02:40.970> at<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
okay so still that fraction up at the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.300 
okay so still that fraction up at the
front<00:02:41.239> negative<00:02:41.810> 18<00:02:42.140> times<00:02:42.590> whatever<00:02:42.980> comes

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
front negative 18 times whatever comes

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.809 
front negative 18 times whatever comes
out<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:46.220> will<00:02:46.340> come<00:02:46.489> out<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.700> be<00:02:46.790> a

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
out of this so it will come out to be a

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:54.880 
out of this so it will come out to be a
2<00:02:47.030> by<00:02:47.180> 2<00:02:50.980> negative<00:02:51.980> 6<00:02:52.250> 29<00:02:52.730> x<00:02:53.450> 40<00:02:54.200> negative<00:02:54.590> six<00:02:54.799> x

minus<00:03:35.930> forty<00:03:36.560> four<00:03:36.799> comes<00:03:37.040> up<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.280> be<00:03:37.370> negative

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
minus forty four comes up to be negative

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.050 
minus forty four comes up to be negative
56<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:39.890> at<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.069> point<00:03:40.310> we<00:03:40.489> can<00:03:40.640> use<00:03:40.819> our

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
56 so at this point we can use our

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.750 
56 so at this point we can use our
negative<00:03:41.540> 18<00:03:41.930> we<00:03:42.530> simplify<00:03:43.010> this<00:03:43.069> out<00:03:43.400> we<00:03:43.609> at

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
negative 18 we simplify this out we at

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.360 
negative 18 we simplify this out we at
you<00:03:43.970> get<00:03:44.120> negative<00:03:44.720> 18<00:03:45.139> times<00:03:45.470> negative<00:03:45.769> 24

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
you get negative 18 times negative 24

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.120 
you get negative 18 times negative 24
will<00:03:46.579> become<00:03:46.850> 24<00:03:47.359> /<00:03:47.630> 8<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.139> 3<00:03:48.560> negatives<00:03:49.100> cancel

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
will become 24 / 8 is 3 negatives cancel

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.580 
will become 24 / 8 is 3 negatives cancel
out<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.579> we<00:03:49.639> get<00:03:49.790> positive<00:03:50.150> 3<00:03:50.720> negative<00:03:51.200> 18

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
out so we get positive 3 negative 18

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.860 
out so we get positive 3 negative 18
times<00:03:51.829> negative<00:03:52.010> 40<00:03:52.430> becomes<00:03:52.700> positive<00:03:53.450> 5

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
times negative 40 becomes positive 5

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.650 
times negative 40 becomes positive 5
negative<00:03:54.500> 18<00:03:54.920> x<00:03:55.220> 16<00:03:55.400> becomes<00:03:55.940> negative<00:03:56.450> 2

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
negative 18 x 16 becomes negative 2

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.770 
negative 18 x 16 becomes negative 2
negative<00:03:56.870> 18<00:03:57.590> times<00:03:57.920> negative<00:03:58.250> 56<00:03:59.030> becomes

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
negative 18 times negative 56 becomes

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.050 
negative 18 times negative 56 becomes
positive<00:04:00.680> 7<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.670> we've<00:04:01.940> got<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.829> equals<00:04:04.060> 35

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
positive 7 so we've got a equals 35

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.830 
positive 7 so we've got a equals 35
negative<00:04:05.780> 27<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.859> there<00:04:07.130> we<00:04:07.280> are<00:04:07.690> we<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.780> to

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
negative 27 and there we are we have to

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.449 
negative 27 and there we are we have to
do<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:08.959> lot<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.319> arithmetic<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.100> get<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.340> this

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
do a lot of arithmetic to get to this

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.800 
do a lot of arithmetic to get to this
point<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:10.819> let's<00:04:11.120> double<00:04:11.420> check<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.630> make

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
point so let's double check and make

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.599 
point so let's double check and make
sure<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.350> that<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.799> answer<00:04:12.920> we<00:04:13.400> know

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
sure that that is the answer we know

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.920 
sure that that is the answer we know
that<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.209> times<00:04:14.780> B<00:04:16.150> has<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.359> be<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:17.690> guy<00:04:17.900> right

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
that a times B has to be this guy right

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.479 
that a times B has to be this guy right
here<00:04:18.169> because<00:04:18.500> we<00:04:18.650> were<00:04:18.709> given<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.130> be<00:04:19.280> right

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
here because we were given a be right

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.860 
here because we were given a be right
from<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.729> beginning<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.389> let's<00:04:20.510> take<00:04:20.659> a<00:04:20.690> look

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
from the beginning so let's take a look

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.230 
from the beginning so let's take a look
what<00:04:21.109> would<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.470> times<00:04:21.919> B<00:04:22.280> be<00:04:22.490> well<00:04:22.909> we<00:04:23.060> know

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
what would a times B be well we know

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.640 
what would a times B be well we know
what<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.479> a<00:04:23.510> B<00:04:23.780> we<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.110> figured<00:04:24.380> out<00:04:24.500> is

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
what the a B we just figured out is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.330 
what the a B we just figured out is
that's<00:04:24.890> three

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that's three

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.080 
that's three
five<00:04:26.430> negative<00:04:27.080> 27<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:29.340> B<00:04:29.520> we<00:04:29.730> started

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
five negative 27 and the B we started

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.850 
five negative 27 and the B we started
off<00:04:30.210> with<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.540> we<00:04:30.660> were<00:04:30.750> given<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.230> negative

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
off with that we were given is negative

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.450 
off with that we were given is negative
2<00:04:33.139> 304<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:35.820> work<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.150> out<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:37.470> 35<00:04:38.160> on

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
2 304 so we work this out the 35 on

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.790 
2 304 so we work this out the 35 on
negative<00:04:38.760> 20<00:04:39.120> that's<00:04:39.330> going<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.600> get<00:04:39.690> us<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.930> 635

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
negative 20 that's going to get us a 635

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.480 
negative 20 that's going to get us a 635
on<00:04:41.570> 340<00:04:42.570> web<00:04:42.810> sorry<00:04:42.990> not<00:04:43.320> six<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:43.830> negative<00:04:44.280> 6

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
on 340 web sorry not six but negative 6

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.100 
on 340 web sorry not six but negative 6
35<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.600> 34<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.199> going<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.380> get<00:04:46.470> us<00:04:46.560> 9<00:04:46.889> +<00:04:47.400> 20<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.300> 29

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
35 on 34 is going to get us 9 + 20 so 29

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.710 
35 on 34 is going to get us 9 + 20 so 29
negative<00:04:49.979> 27<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.550> negative<00:04:51.030> 20<00:04:51.389> is<00:04:51.479> going<00:04:51.660> to

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
negative 27 on negative 20 is going to

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.670 
negative 27 on negative 20 is going to
give<00:04:51.810> us<00:04:51.840> negative<00:04:51.960> two<00:04:52.169> times<00:04:52.350> negative<00:04:52.380> to

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
give us negative two times negative to

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.540 
give us negative two times negative to
positive<00:04:52.790> 4<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.120> negative<00:04:54.960> 27<00:04:55.740> on<00:04:55.919> 34

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
positive 4 and negative 27 on 34

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.490 
positive 4 and negative 27 on 34
negative<00:04:56.910> 2<00:04:57.030> times<00:04:57.150> 3<00:04:57.540> gets<00:04:57.750> negative<00:04:58.110> six

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
negative 2 times 3 gets negative six

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.310 
negative 2 times 3 gets negative six
seven<00:04:58.950> times<00:04:59.190> for<00:04:59.639> gets<00:04:59.910> us<00:05:00.060> 28<00:05:00.840> add<00:05:01.050> those

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
seven times for gets us 28 add those

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.040 
seven times for gets us 28 add those
together<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.800> get<00:05:01.950> 22<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.900> is

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
together you get 22 and so that is

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.500 
together you get 22 and so that is
exactly<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.740> AV<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:05.610> we<00:05:05.729> started<00:05:06.060> with<00:05:06.120> so

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
exactly the AV that we started with so

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.110 
exactly the AV that we started with so
it<00:05:06.630> checks<00:05:06.810> out<00:05:07.020> our<00:05:07.260> answer<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.919> good<00:05:08.460> great

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
it checks out our answer is good great

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.610 
it checks out our answer is good great
alright<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.139> completes<00:05:10.560> the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
alright so that completes the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.870 
alright so that completes the
understanding<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.280> determinants<00:05:11.760> and

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
understanding of determinants and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.159 
understanding of determinants and
inverses<00:05:12.450> we've<00:05:12.630> got<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.750> great<00:05:13.020> understanding

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
inverses we've got a great understanding

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.100 
inverses we've got a great understanding
of<00:05:13.800> how<00:05:13.919> that<00:05:14.160> works<00:05:14.460> right<00:05:14.790> now<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.570> we'll<00:05:15.990> see

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
of how that works right now so we'll see

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.379 
of how that works right now so we'll see
