that<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.500> very<00:01:07.619> important<00:01:08.180> hey<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that that was very important hey I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.389 
that that was very important hey I
thought<00:01:09.960> alright<00:01:10.289> I'll<00:01:10.500> give<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.160> shot

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
thought alright I'll give this a shot

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.240 
thought alright I'll give this a shot
and<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.759> how<00:01:11.789> it<00:01:12.030> goes<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.560> been<00:01:13.710> 27

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and see how it goes and it's been 27

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.080 
and see how it goes and it's been 27
years<00:01:14.399> and<00:01:14.729> counting<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> think<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
years and counting but I I think the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
years and counting but I I think the
reason<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.600> been<00:01:18.720> 27<00:01:19.080> years<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.560> Counting

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
reason it's been 27 years and Counting

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
another four or five years we compiled

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.440 
another four or five years we compiled

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
different thing that's and that that's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.529 
different thing that's and that that's
the<00:04:29.950> most<00:04:30.100> fun<00:04:30.310> because<00:04:30.580> you're<00:04:30.760> you're

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
the most fun because you're you're

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.529 
the most fun because you're you're
