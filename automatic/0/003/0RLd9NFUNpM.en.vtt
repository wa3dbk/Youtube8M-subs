00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
check it out getting started this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330 
check it out getting started this
movement<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.599> broken<00:00:27.869> down<00:00:28.170> into<00:00:28.470> two<00:00:28.769> parts

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
movement is broken down into two parts

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.200 
movement is broken down into two parts
all<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.900> first<00:00:31.199> part<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
all right so the first part is the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.479 
all right so the first part is the
lifting<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> heel<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.829> that

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.360 

and<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> second<00:00:39.930> part<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> leaning<00:00:40.829> backwards

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
and the second part is leaning backwards

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.119 
and the second part is leaning backwards
with<00:00:41.640> upper<00:00:41.969> body<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.510> looks<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.549 

okay<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:49.579> let's<00:00:49.820> start<00:00:50.089> with<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:50.659> lifting

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
okay so let's start with that lifting

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.759 
okay so let's start with that lifting
the<00:00:51.890> heels<00:00:52.190> first<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.300> pretty<00:00:54.050> simple

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
the heels first so pretty simple

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.250 
the heels first so pretty simple
you're<00:00:55.250> gonna<00:00:55.489> have<00:00:55.729> your<00:00:55.760> toes<00:00:56.659> pointed

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
you're gonna have your toes pointed

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.689 
you're gonna have your toes pointed
outwards<00:00:57.679> so<00:00:57.979> it's<00:00:58.250> going<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.429> be<00:00:58.519> this

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
outwards so it's going to be this

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.729 
outwards so it's going to be this
direction<00:00:59.000> this<00:00:59.629> direction<00:00:59.690> when<00:01:00.620> you're

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
direction this direction when you're

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.920 
direction this direction when you're
going<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.979> do

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.830 

I<00:01:09.100> can<00:01:10.100> make<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.370> more<00:01:10.520> subtle<00:01:10.820> or<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:11.660> can

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
I can make it more subtle or you can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.890 
I can make it more subtle or you can
have<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> bigger<00:01:12.800> that's<00:01:13.520> like<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.450> follow<00:01:14.690> me
