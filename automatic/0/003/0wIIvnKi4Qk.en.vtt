00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580 

the<00:00:05.890> piece<00:00:06.130> but<00:00:06.370> I've<00:00:06.460> done<00:00:06.609> a<00:00:06.670> 21c<00:00:07.330> is<00:00:07.660> part<00:00:08.500> of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
the piece but I've done a 21c is part of

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.810 
the piece but I've done a 21c is part of
a<00:00:08.680> series<00:00:08.920> I've<00:00:09.160> been<00:00:09.280> working<00:00:09.550> on<00:00:09.580> for<00:00:09.790> a

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
a series I've been working on for a

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.530 
a series I've been working on for a
while<00:00:09.880> called<00:00:10.360> healing<00:00:10.780> and<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.980> project<00:00:12.540> an

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
while called healing and I project an

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.840 
while called healing and I project an
organic<00:00:13.990> carpet<00:00:14.380> on<00:00:14.470> the<00:00:14.500> floor<00:00:14.830> and<00:00:15.580> when<00:00:15.760> you

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
organic carpet on the floor and when you

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.910 
organic carpet on the floor and when you
walk<00:00:16.029> across<00:00:16.180> it<00:00:16.449> you<00:00:16.689> wound<00:00:16.990> it<00:00:17.170> now<00:00:17.859> you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
walk across it you wound it now you

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.579 
walk across it you wound it now you
actually<00:00:18.189> create<00:00:18.580> sort<00:00:18.760> of<00:00:18.789> a<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:19.420> line<00:00:20.230> right

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
actually create sort of a a line right

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:21.630 
actually create sort of a a line right
through<00:00:20.859> it

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
through it

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.609 
through it
when<00:00:22.029> you<00:00:22.089> turn<00:00:22.329> around<00:00:22.359> and<00:00:22.659> watch<00:00:22.960> it<00:00:23.259> the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
when you turn around and watch it the

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.649 
when you turn around and watch it the
carpet<00:00:24.039> heals<00:00:24.310> behind<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:24.970> it<00:00:25.150> heals<00:00:25.359> itself

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:25.659 
carpet heals behind you it heals itself

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.229 
carpet heals behind you it heals itself
but<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.589> cool<00:00:26.800> thing<00:00:26.829> of<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.880> interesting

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:28.239 
but the cool thing of a the interesting

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.389 
but the cool thing of a the interesting
thing<00:00:28.390> for<00:00:28.539> me<00:00:28.599> about<00:00:28.989> these<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.499> that<00:00:29.529> they

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
thing for me about these is that they

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.090 
thing for me about these is that they
never<00:00:30.609> heal<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.119> same<00:00:31.300> way<00:00:31.419> twice<00:00:31.480> so<00:00:32.439> you're

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
never heal the same way twice so you're

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.759 
never heal the same way twice so you're
walking<00:00:34.060> through<00:00:34.540> it<00:00:34.660> your<00:00:34.899> interaction<00:00:35.590> is

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
walking through it your interaction is

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.860 
walking through it your interaction is
actually<00:00:36.280> created<00:00:36.879> kind<00:00:36.969> of<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.149> scar<00:00:37.510> that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
actually created kind of a scar that

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.139 
actually created kind of a scar that
will<00:00:38.710> remain<00:00:39.010> there<00:00:39.160> forever<00:00:39.280> until<00:00:39.850> somebody

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
will remain there forever until somebody

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.119 
will remain there forever until somebody
else<00:00:40.269> walks<00:00:40.539> across<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:41.739> this<00:00:41.920> is<00:00:42.010> this

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
else walks across it so this is this

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.549 
else walks across it so this is this
nicer<00:00:42.519> thread<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.390> piece<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:44.500> the

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
nicer thread and the piece and the

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.169 
nicer thread and the piece and the
moment<00:00:44.859> you<00:00:44.920> turn<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.219> on<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.820> current

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
moment you turn it on to the current

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.119 
moment you turn it on to the current
moment<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:47.079> every<00:00:47.350> single<00:00:47.530> person<00:00:47.769> has<00:00:48.039> ever

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
moment that every single person has ever

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.590 
moment that every single person has ever
walked<00:00:48.429> on<00:00:48.609> it<00:00:48.789> so<00:00:48.879> that's<00:00:49.059> kind<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.269> a<00:00:49.390> bit<00:00:49.510> of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
walked on it so that's kind of a bit of

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.950 
walked on it so that's kind of a bit of
a<00:00:49.660> history

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
a history

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.090 
a history
I<00:00:52.020> am<00:00:52.829> simulating<00:00:53.540> natural<00:00:54.540> patterns<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.860> so

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I am simulating natural patterns and so

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.680 
I am simulating natural patterns and so
think<00:00:56.399> about<00:00:56.489> zebra<00:00:57.210> okay

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
think about zebra okay

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
think about zebra okay
the<00:00:57.989> mother<00:00:58.230> isn't<00:00:58.530> painting<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> stripes

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the mother isn't painting the stripes

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.759 
the mother isn't painting the stripes
are<00:00:59.460> what's<00:00:59.879> happening<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:01.019> are<00:01:01.230> cells

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
are what's happening is there are cells

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.340 
are what's happening is there are cells
and<00:01:02.640> themselves<00:01:02.790> are<00:01:03.360> expressing<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.050> certain

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and themselves are expressing a certain

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.290 
and themselves are expressing a certain
color<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> black<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.070> white<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.090> each

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
color or the black or white and each

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.640 
color or the black or white and each
cell<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.229> with

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
cell all they know about with

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
cell all they know about with
neighboring<00:01:08.009> cells<00:01:08.250> okay<00:01:08.850> they've<00:01:09.450> got<00:01:09.600> some

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
neighboring cells okay they've got some

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
neighboring cells okay they've got some
complex<00:01:10.530> sort<00:01:10.800> of<00:01:10.920> system<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.399> place<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
complex sort of system in place at the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
complex sort of system in place at the
side<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.450> hmm<00:01:12.840> black<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.200> white<00:01:13.380> but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
side really hmm black or white but

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340 
side really hmm black or white but
somehow<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.390> simple<00:01:15.810> interactions

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
somehow is very simple interactions

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.550 
somehow is very simple interactions
between<00:01:16.530> each<00:01:16.830> cell<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.220> its<00:01:17.340> neighbours<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
between each cell and its neighbours is

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.780 
between each cell and its neighbours is
stabilizing<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:19.950> beautiful<00:01:20.340> patterns

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
stabilizing to these beautiful patterns

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.370 
stabilizing to these beautiful patterns
so<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:21.720> interesting<00:01:22.140> thing

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so it's this really interesting thing

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
so it's this really interesting thing
like<00:01:22.649> how<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.460> something<00:01:23.909> very

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
like how do you get something very

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.060 
like how do you get something very
complex<00:01:24.690> out<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:25.890> simple

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
complex out of these very simple

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
complex out of these very simple
interactions<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:28.229> there's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
interactions and it's like to me there's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.779 
interactions and it's like to me there's
something<00:01:28.410> really<00:01:28.710> magical<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
something really magical about that and

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.790 
something really magical about that and
you<00:01:30.300> can<00:01:30.420> look<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.690> lots<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.289> systems<00:01:31.649> always

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
you can look at lots of systems always

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.260 
you can look at lots of systems always
on<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.190> micro<00:01:32.550> level<00:01:32.670> within<00:01:32.970> within<00:01:33.149> our

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
on a micro level within within our

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
on a micro level within within our
brains<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.380> our<00:01:34.500> brains<00:01:34.740> our

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
brains right what are our brains our

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
brains right what are our brains our
brains<00:01:35.610> are<00:01:35.850> billions<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.420> neurons<00:01:36.630> okay<00:01:37.140> each

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
brains are billions of neurons okay each

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
brains are billions of neurons okay each
neuron<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:38.039> it<00:01:38.130> knows<00:01:38.280> about<00:01:38.429> its

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
neuron all it knows about its

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.180 
neuron all it knows about its
neighboring<00:01:39.149> neurons<00:01:39.479> send<00:01:40.440> signals<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> them

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
neighboring neurons send signals to them

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.130 
neighboring neurons send signals to them
each<00:01:41.369> normal<00:01:41.550> wants<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.940> kind<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.149> survive<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
each normal wants to kind of survive the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.320 
each normal wants to kind of survive the
connections<00:01:43.619> want<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.860> survive<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.940> out<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
connections want to survive and out of

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.389 
connections want to survive and out of
that<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.960> amazing<00:01:46.320> illusion<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that we get this amazing illusion of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
that we get this amazing illusion of
consciousness<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.300> freewill<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.440> these

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
consciousness and freewill and all these

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.169 
consciousness and freewill and all these
things<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.399> could<00:01:50.520> argue<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:50.909> whether

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
things and you could argue about whether

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.520 
things and you could argue about whether
those<00:01:51.330> or<00:01:51.479> illusions<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.110> writing<00:01:52.440> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
those or illusions are not writing this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.169 
those or illusions are not writing this
you<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.800> at<00:01:53.100> centuries<00:01:53.580> all<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.789> argument

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
you know at centuries all the argument

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.289 
you know at centuries all the argument
but<00:01:54.440> somehow<00:01:55.440> this<00:01:55.860> magical<00:01:56.610> conception<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
but somehow this magical conception of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
but somehow this magical conception of
self<00:01:57.540> comes<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.320> these<00:01:58.500> billions<00:01:59.130> of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
self comes out of these billions of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
self comes out of these billions of
little

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
little

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.960 
little
and<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:01.409> lot<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.829> these<00:02:01.920> pieces<00:02:02.159> are

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
and a lot of these pieces are

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.030 
and a lot of these pieces are
explorations<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.350> happens<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:04.890> two

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
explorations of what happens when two

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.639 
explorations of what happens when two
things<00:02:05.310> interact<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.229> permanent<00:02:07.229> changes

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
things interact and permanent changes

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.770 
things interact and permanent changes
that<00:02:07.829> occur<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.729> idea<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.300> causality

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that occur and this idea of causality

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.390 
that occur and this idea of causality
you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.319> how<00:02:10.590> everything<00:02:10.950> affects

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you know how everything affects

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000 
you know how everything affects
everything<00:02:11.580> else
