00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.649 

so<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.709> got<00:00:01.920> my<00:00:02.040> Sigma<00:00:02.429> 150<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.360> 600

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
so I got my Sigma 150 to 600

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.140 
so I got my Sigma 150 to 600
contemporary<00:00:04.529> today<00:00:04.830> I've<00:00:05.730> been<00:00:05.819> seeing<00:00:06.029> too

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
contemporary today I've been seeing too

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.670 
contemporary today I've been seeing too
many<00:00:06.240> videos<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.170> thought<00:00:07.379> I'd<00:00:07.529> just

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
many videos on this I thought I'd just

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.919 
many videos on this I thought I'd just
shoot<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.919> quick<00:00:08.700> video<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.389> give<00:00:09.420> an<00:00:09.690> overview

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
shoot a quick video to give an overview

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.660 
shoot a quick video to give an overview
and<00:00:10.650> somebody<00:00:11.070> hasn't<00:00:11.190> seen<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> other

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
and somebody hasn't seen the other

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.709 
and somebody hasn't seen the other
videos<00:00:13.549> so<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.790> see<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.540> fairly

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
videos so as you can see it's a fairly

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.689 
videos so as you can see it's a fairly
large<00:00:15.990> lens<00:00:16.350> I'd<00:00:16.650> say<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> coolant<00:00:17.400> size

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
large lens I'd say it's a coolant size

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.420 
large lens I'd say it's a coolant size
to<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> Sigma<00:00:18.630> 50<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> 500<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.859> had<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to the Sigma 50 to 500 I had one of

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.340 
to the Sigma 50 to 500 I had one of
those<00:00:20.550> back<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> day<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.420> believe<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.140> one

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
those back in the day I believe this one

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.859 
those back in the day I believe this one
is<00:00:22.380> about<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.740> inch<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> half<00:00:23.250> longer

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
is about an inch and a half longer

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.800 
is about an inch and a half longer
diameter<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.289> around<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> same<00:00:25.800> size

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
diameter I think is around the same size

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
diameter I think is around the same size
because<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.740> buttons<00:00:29.039> over<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.250> for

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because the buttons over here for

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.010 
because the buttons over here for
autofocus<00:00:30.920> manual<00:00:31.920> focus<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> mo<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.719> gives

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
autofocus manual focus and mo this gives

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.220 
autofocus manual focus and mo this gives
you<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:35.130> ability<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.600> manually<00:00:36.600> focus<00:00:36.660> while

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you the ability to manually focus while

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.580 
you the ability to manually focus while
your<00:00:37.410> auto<00:00:37.559> focusing<00:00:39.110> know<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> difference

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
your auto focusing know the difference

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
your auto focusing know the difference
between<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:42.090> having<00:00:42.300> focus

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
between that and just having focus

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
between that and just having focus

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
your micro adjustments in it or if you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.070 
your micro adjustments in it or if you
want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> dynamic<00:01:13.490> OS<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.960> adjust<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
want to do a dynamic OS or adjust the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.910 
want to do a dynamic OS or adjust the
focus<00:01:16.439> speed<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.689> I<00:01:18.689> turned<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> dynamic

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
focus speed of it I turned on a dynamic

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.120 
focus speed of it I turned on a dynamic
OS<00:01:20.220> which<00:01:20.900> also<00:01:21.900> made<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.770> stabilization

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
OS which also made this stabilization

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.149 
OS which also made this stabilization
much<00:01:23.729> smoother<00:01:24.270> through<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> viewfinder

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
much smoother through the viewfinder

beforehand it had a slight jittery look
to<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> dynamic<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.100> its

of length it has to land under pull out
to<00:01:44.310> 600<00:01:44.729> millimeters<00:01:46.189> there's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> lock<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.850> the

side to lock it or if you want to shoot
at<00:01:50.939> certain<00:01:51.210> distances<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> soft

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
at certain distances you can do a soft

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.120 
at certain distances you can do a soft
lock<00:01:52.740> which<00:01:53.490> will<00:01:53.520> lock<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.509> position

lock which will lock it at that position

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.690 
lock which will lock it at that position
but<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> give<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> good<00:01:57.259> bit<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.439> turn

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
but if you give it a good bit of a turn

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.249 
but if you give it a good bit of a turn
it'll<00:01:59.700> unlock<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.689> keep<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:01.020> so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it'll unlock it so you can keep going so

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
it'll unlock it so you can keep going so
it<00:02:01.320> doesn't<00:02:01.619> fully<00:02:01.799> lock<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> keeps<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it doesn't fully lock it but it keeps it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.819 
it doesn't fully lock it but it keeps it
in<00:02:03.360> place<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.899> shooting<00:02:04.079> upwards<00:02:04.710> or

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
in place if you're shooting upwards or

in place if you're shooting upwards or
downwards<00:02:05.689> which<00:02:06.689> i<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> nice

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
downwards which i think is a nice

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.330 
downwards which i think is a nice

feature focus on it seems relatively
quick

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
going to be super fast looking so it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.470 
going to be super fast looking so it's
kind<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.710> hard<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.920> judge<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.550> without<00:02:29.330> being

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
kind of hard to judge that without being

to<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.260> very<00:02:36.470> nice<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.980> owe<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> system<00:02:37.940> also<00:02:38.090> is

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
to be very nice I owe a system also is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.530 
to be very nice I owe a system also is
very<00:02:38.630> very<00:02:39.050> very<00:02:39.709> good<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.220> was<00:02:41.150> playing<00:02:41.420> around

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
very very very good I was playing around

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.140 
very very very good I was playing around
I<00:02:41.959> shot<00:02:42.230> at<00:02:42.380> 125th<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.220> second<00:02:43.640> at<00:02:43.730> 600

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
I shot at 125th of a second at 600

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.390 
I shot at 125th of a second at 600
millimeters<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.750> I'd<00:02:44.870> say<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.190> image<00:02:46.190> was

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
millimeters and I'd say that image was

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.430 
millimeters and I'd say that image was
perfectly<00:02:47.090> usable<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.870> that's<00:02:48.110> pretty

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
perfectly usable so that's pretty

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.470 
perfectly usable so that's pretty

speed<00:02:50.600> at<00:02:51.320> 600<00:02:51.890> millimeters<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.350> see

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
speed at 600 millimeters but you can see

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.110 
speed at 600 millimeters but you can see
the<00:02:54.590> size<00:02:54.800> differences<00:02:55.370> between<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.940> two

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the size differences between the two

the size differences between the two
lenses<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:58.190> small<00:02:58.520> 7,200<00:02:59.450> at<00:02:59.540> 4<00:03:00.520> versus
