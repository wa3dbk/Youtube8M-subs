it's right on the little binding here
and<00:00:45.409> this<00:00:46.129> is<00:00:46.280> essentially<00:00:46.790> as<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.239> piece<00:00:47.839> of

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
and this is essentially as a piece of

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.119 
and this is essentially as a piece of
plastic<00:00:48.589> or<00:00:48.799> vinyl<00:00:49.720> with<00:00:50.720> some<00:00:50.989> hard<00:00:51.710> pieces

in<00:00:52.400> it<00:00:52.549> it's<00:00:53.059> pretty<00:00:53.420> flexible<00:00:53.629> has<00:00:54.530> a

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
in it it's pretty flexible has a

in it it's pretty flexible has a
magnetic<00:00:55.040> latch<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.330> magnetic<00:00:56.869> clasp<00:00:57.440> that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
magnetic latch and a magnetic clasp that

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.799 
magnetic latch and a magnetic clasp that
attaches<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.549> the<00:00:58.970> tablet<00:00:59.750> like<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.580> and

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
attaches to the tablet like that and

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.140 
attaches to the tablet like that and
there<00:01:02.809> you<00:01:02.839> go<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:04.430> can<00:01:04.549> see<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.879> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
there you go and you can see that the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.190 
there you go and you can see that the
back<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.979> left<00:01:06.979> unprotected<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:08.359> completely

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
back is left unprotected it's completely

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.880 
back is left unprotected it's completely
open<00:01:09.859> so<00:01:10.100> are<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.340> sides<00:01:11.350> three<00:01:12.350> sides<00:01:12.530> this

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
open so are the sides three sides this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.469 
open so are the sides three sides this
side<00:01:13.100> has<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> little<00:01:13.520> bit<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.909> protection

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
side has a little bit of a protection

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.060 
side has a little bit of a protection
because<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.899> has<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.399> hinge<00:01:16.399> in<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:16.939> but<00:01:18.070> it

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
because it has a hinge in there but it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.649 
because it has a hinge in there but it
works<00:01:19.280> like<00:01:19.399> that<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.880> turns<00:01:20.119> as<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:20.390> can<00:01:20.509> see

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
works like that it turns as you can see

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.349 
works like that it turns as you can see
it<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:20.899> turned<00:01:21.140> on<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.350> tablet<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:23.000> close

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
it just turned on the tablet you close

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.389 
it just turned on the tablet you close
it<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:23.689> turns<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:24.049> all<00:01:24.170> off<00:01:24.320> open<00:01:25.009> it<00:01:25.100> up<00:01:25.219> it

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
it it turns it all off open it up it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.169 
it it turns it all off open it up it
turns<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:26.000> back<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:27.740> can<00:01:28.399> be<00:01:28.520> used<00:01:28.820> as<00:01:29.119> a

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
turns it back on it can be used as a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.929 
turns it back on it can be used as a
stand<00:01:31.240> like<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.299> or<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:34.340> could<00:01:34.460> use<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:34.789> as<00:01:34.909> a

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
stand like that or you could use it as a

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.709 
stand like that or you could use it as a
stand<00:01:35.329> like<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:36.679> more<00:01:37.159> flat<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.570> guess

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
stand like that more flat and I guess

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.929 
stand like that more flat and I guess
with<00:01:38.899> a<00:01:38.929> keyboard<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.679> then<00:01:40.130> like<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.579> for

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
with a keyboard and then like this for

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.510 
with a keyboard and then like this for
gaming<00:01:41.359> or<00:01:41.450> watching<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.929> movie<00:01:42.369> because<00:01:43.369> if

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
gaming or watching a movie because if

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.300 
gaming or watching a movie because if
you're<00:01:43.670> watching<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:44.060> more<00:01:44.270> from<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.630> front

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
you're watching it more from in front

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.950 
you're watching it more from in front
anyway<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.210> that's<00:01:47.569> that<00:01:47.899> one<00:01:48.109> that's<00:01:48.319> $40<00:01:49.960> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
anyway so that's that one that's $40 and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.510 
anyway so that's that one that's $40 and
that<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.259> pulls<00:01:51.499> off<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.950> on<00:01:52.069> just<00:01:52.310> with

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
that just pulls off and on just with

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.059 
that just pulls off and on just with
magnetic<00:01:53.020> business<00:01:54.020> or<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.530> inside<00:01:54.829> of<00:01:54.979> this

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
magnetic business or the inside of this

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.149 
magnetic business or the inside of this
by<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.340> way<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.049> microfiber<00:01:57.710> it's<00:01:58.009> nice

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
by the way is is a microfiber it's nice

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.480 
by the way is is a microfiber it's nice
and<00:01:58.429> smooth<00:01:58.759> but<00:01:59.179> it<00:01:59.990> has<00:02:00.109> a<00:02:00.139> soft<00:02:01.130> feeling

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
any 7 or 8 inch tablet and you just use

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.240 
any 7 or 8 inch tablet and you just use
these<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.900> rubber<00:02:15.019> band-like<00:02:15.530> things<00:02:15.950> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
these little rubber band-like things and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.680 
these little rubber band-like things and
put<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
around each corner like that and it

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.250 
around each corner like that and it
seems<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.330> hold<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.780> there<00:02:22.960> pretty<00:02:23.140> well

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
seems to hold it in there pretty well

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.440 
seems to hold it in there pretty well
does<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.220> go<00:02:24.370> anywhere<00:02:24.580> once<00:02:24.910> it's<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.240> there

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
does it go anywhere once it's in there

and back it zips all the way around that

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.050 
and back it zips all the way around that
so<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.210> completely<00:02:43.540> encloses<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:45.610> does<00:02:45.880> not
