 warn you about a small one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 my snag 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.650
 You probably noticed that reviews are coming out 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 a bit late yes very reading as well 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.189
 everything began to take off me 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.480
 getting out is all due to the fact that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 ended vacation studied New Year 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 holidays i went out guys to work to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.489
 Sorry now the videos will come out 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.700
 a little less but work is work and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.079
 Well, I'm sorry of course the cart and so on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 today's review is dedicated to us 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.660
 car gas-53 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.950
 but not the car itself, but rather this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.309
 huge pacu 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.570
 in this review we will see a lot 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:00.469
 trailers that go to him 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.469
 [music] 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.280
 Well, I think the car itself, in principle 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.390
 show sense no particular gas-53 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.729
 ordinary 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.160
 bribe on the usual base which was 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.170
 us and earlier you can see the review 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.840
 and about him I have to channel 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.110
 can look at him there he goes 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.470
 just a dump truck here in here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.259
 Well, some minor errors are corrected. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 added mirrors want to note of course 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 well yes still some changes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 add supplements added here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.190
 are present that is not without 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.450
 This well and the first trailer is such 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.940
 here 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.580
 milk tanker such a barrel such a thing 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.830
 is when you come up opens as 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.060
 jump out of it and so do not fit 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.070
 these hatches open 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.710
 and here I am most interested of course 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.619
 now there is no opportunity to pour here 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.680
 milk and about very surely myself would like 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.619
 see if there is no content when 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.270
 milk is poured as it looks here 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.860
 who will see me in the comments 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.259
 write 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.200
 the next cistern is our cistern 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.709
 fuel tanker carriage fuel is here 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.459
 such a garbage here we flashing 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.520
 beacon when the car we catch it like 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.000
 right here on the roof 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.390
 I want to appear right away when I appear 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 tried to fasten 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.530
 that is, everything here is normal clings 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.930
 flashing light appears on the roof 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.410
 after i put the barrel in place 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.780
 that is, this cant disappeared that is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.569
 it appears only when you buy, I right now 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.459
 bought a lobe she hangs here 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.790
 when after you at least once 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.380
 in unhooked and he looks for when 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.990
 This course is suitable barrel here 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.510
 nothing is already revealed all principle 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.300
 clear and the next two trailers we have 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.920
 go it is an onboard such platforms 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.430
 dump trucks that is one small such 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.500
 the volume as I jumped in here 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.750
 so one us small 2 we go with 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.640
 its sides are taller well and 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.860
 accordingly the grid opens there 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 when the grain dumper or whatever 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.209
 you have loaded the next platform this 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.440
 here we are such a trailer well, and like all dinner 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.690
 everyone is already known 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.480
 here we can carry seeds 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.239
 fertilizer and so on and so forth 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.310
 By the way, I myself have never even such 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.850
 The thing and did not use non-standard 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.519
 Anemones sky do n't even know it is convenient or 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.030
 no write who knows who uses 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.880
 and the next booth as well, of course there is everything 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.549
 it is clear here everything is written this bread is 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.519
 booth for the transport of bread does not load 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.140
 I tried to immediately say I do not know there is 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.269
 any animation or not hope 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.200
 what would be interesting 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.900
 at least 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.090
 to carry bread fashionably next booth with us 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.860
 there is almost the same only inscription 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.290
 we have products on it that I carry in it 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.750
 I have no idea I do not know what is in it 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.120
 I seem to be reading and hearing 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.010
 what's on this map for example i'm playing 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.239
 for example, on the cinema map 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.909
 some say there is 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.069
 some sausage there something else again 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.739
 will help where there is perhaps this booth 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.199
 just for this purpose i intended not 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.780
 I know the following we have such a barrel 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.050
 Well, of course, they all probably already understood 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.139
 for transportation of liquid manure volume exactly 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.470
 I do not know and the spread I also do not know what 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.150
 with her 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.030
 she can be it at all without scatter 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.810
 but just for transportation although present 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.570
 some tap 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.400
 maybe all the same it's like 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.190
 sprinkler well and the last barrel 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.199
 we see the last trailer 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.169
 inscription live fish using this 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.760
 trailer we can carry fish here too 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.120
 nothing opens nothing we don't 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.840
 see what we can say in common about 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.900
 In this fashion, in principle, for cards and bastards 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.449
 cinema for example yes only by putting here 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.910
 this ramp gaz-53 you can buy 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.789
 several trucks and each 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.650
 truck to put on his mind 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.080
 trailer and you all and you can do 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.910
 everyone can carry if you can 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.599
 transport there or work with everything 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.849
 crop types for gas only 53 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.280
 that is, you have it for bread as well 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.380
 the same fish milk and 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.180
 the tank you have there is 1 you all 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.550
 will be as I play with the same 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.270
 of course I would like to notice that 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.669
 lacks 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.440
 the platform also would be detailed 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.680
 very cool but still this pack is 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.680
 very very big pack 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.759
 I say thanks to the developers we need 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.160
 I really like this fact 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.229
 I will definitely play with him roughly 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.120
 saying again i will repeat that with this 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.570
 pokon you can them on the card baldey movie 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.300
 do everything and carry bread and milk and fish 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.400
 and everybody, well, let's take a look at 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.400
 shop look at the whole thing and 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.280
 the sounds in the store our gas 53 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.259
 as well as all absolutely all these trailers 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.020
 are in the modification section 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:12.270
 different categories 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.840
 gas-53 itself costs us 9 thousand euros 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.930
 service per day is 20 euros so how are we 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.870
 see all trailers are not so 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.720
 Expensive two thousand one and a half thousand 800 then 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.669
 there is not all that expensive 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.590
 buy and play calmly here 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.139
 did not change anything well, in principle, not 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.599
 I'm going to change anything of course you 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.300
 already know that I like to play on hard 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:39.300
 yes there everything is more expensive more expensive to be 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.490
 harder to buy well here as if in the first place 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.130
 she is a mystery how simple and not hunting is all 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.139
 change and secondly but still at least 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.260
 one technique should have been different 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:52.669
 which is easier on which it will be possible 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.229
 quietly at no cost to buy and work 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.789
