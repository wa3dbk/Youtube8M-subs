00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
the way this works is this actually the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.770 
the way this works is this actually the
Box<00:02:41.769> sits<00:02:42.099> up<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.430> top<00:02:44.099> about<00:02:45.099> right<00:02:45.310> here<00:02:45.780> then

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
Box sits up on top about right here then

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.960 
Box sits up on top about right here then
you<00:02:46.810> run<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.319> here<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.280> hook<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:48.760> so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
you run this here you hook it up so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.119 
you run this here you hook it up so
