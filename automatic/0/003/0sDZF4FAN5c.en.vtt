I<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.429> just<00:00:11.700> started<00:00:12.059> sucking<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I really just started sucking in the

I really just started sucking in the
second<00:00:12.929> half<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.290> don't<00:00:13.440> know<00:00:13.500> why<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:13.740> I

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
second half I don't know why but I

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.120 
second half I don't know why but I
started<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.420> great<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.350> don't<00:00:17.070> know

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
started off great and then I don't know

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.370 
started off great and then I don't know
I<00:00:17.160> choked<00:00:17.699> or<00:00:17.910> something<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.990> gameplay

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
I choked or something and the gameplay

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.769 
I choked or something and the gameplay
just<00:00:19.590> kind<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> fell<00:00:19.980> apart<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:21.539> only

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
just kind of fell apart so it's only

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
just kind of fell apart so it's only
half<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.430> lot<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
half of it but I know that a lot of you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
half of it but I know that a lot of you

few<00:02:35.670> days<00:02:35.970> ago<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.269> think<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:38.040> slope

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
few days ago I think and so my slope

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.770 
few days ago I think and so my slope
count<00:02:38.519> went<00:02:38.819> down<00:02:39.030> only<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.390> few<00:02:39.630> hundred

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
count went down only a few hundred

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.059 
count went down only a few hundred
actually<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.349> thought<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:40.739> going<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.920> lose

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.070 
actually I thought was going to lose
more<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.120> personally<00:02:42.569> don't<00:02:42.660> think<00:02:42.780> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
more because I personally don't think I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.130 
more because I personally don't think I
have<00:02:43.310> 1500<00:02:44.310> active<00:02:44.580> subs<00:02:44.850> but<00:02:45.180> um<00:02:45.420> that's
