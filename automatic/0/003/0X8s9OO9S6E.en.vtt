time that takes me to do my makeup

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.710 
time that takes me to do my makeup
allows<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.700> hair<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:58.940> chance<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.420> kind<00:01:59.570> of

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
allows the hair a chance to kind of

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.670 
allows the hair a chance to kind of
shrink<00:02:00.020> up<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.230> form<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.220> nice<00:02:01.400> puff<00:02:02.680> you
