00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
know the way that I do this is I look at

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.640 
know the way that I do this is I look at
last<00:00:18.090> year<00:00:18.420> stats<00:00:18.750> compared<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.590> year

overall at the beginning of the game and
on<00:03:55.850> NBA<00:03:56.209> 2k16<00:03:57.019> my<00:03:58.010> guesstimate<00:03:58.610> on<00:03:58.850> what<00:03:59.299> is

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
on NBA 2k16 my guesstimate on what is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.150 
on NBA 2k16 my guesstimate on what is
over<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.720> will<00:04:00.019> be<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:02.049> 94<00:04:03.049> overall<00:04:03.470> again

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
over I will be is a 94 overall again
