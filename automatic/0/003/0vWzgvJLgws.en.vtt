Hello boys and girls!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.680
Today, we will start learning a lot of fancy hints about tanks.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.720
Many people might not realise a full potential of tank, and this might hold them back from getting one!

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.360
Let’s see what people think about this.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.720
-	Hi! Do you have a minute?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.680
-	Yes, sure!

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.520
-	O.K. I’m Olga and what’s your name?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.520

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.880

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.440
- Do you have your own one?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.560
- No

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.720
- Why?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.320
- I’d love to but it’s so big.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.240
I wouldn’t even know how to park one.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.400
- Richard

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.680
We’ll show it.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.960
It’s really easy.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.920
- Now you see?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.680
Parking a tank is easy!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.360
Now you know one more good thing about a tank!
