00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.150 
in two days and when I was training for
I<00:00:36.370> thought<00:00:36.750> work<00:00:37.750> out<00:00:37.930> on<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.110> regular<00:00:38.199> basis<00:00:38.980> I

ain't<00:00:39.430> never<00:00:39.760> resigned<00:00:40.210> myself<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.809> fact

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
ain't never resigned myself to the fact

that that was my body type my body shape

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.500 
that that was my body type my body shape

more when the gravitational effects your

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.820 
more when the gravitational effects your
thighs<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.780> ways<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.020> they<00:01:14.259> looking<00:01:14.680> at

always<00:01:15.550> being<00:01:15.820> lighter<00:01:16.149> weight<00:01:16.420> or<00:01:16.720> just

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
always being lighter weight or just

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.700 
always being lighter weight or just
heavy

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
heavy

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.260 
heavy
and<00:01:17.950> then<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.280> fact<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.580> men<00:01:18.850> would<00:01:19.060> lift

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
and then the fact that men would lift

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.360 
and then the fact that men would lift
the<00:01:19.480> heavier<00:01:19.780> weights<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.770> not<00:01:21.040> do<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
the heavier weights and not do the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.820 
the heavier weights and not do the
aerobic<00:01:21.790> activity<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.510> thing<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:23.020> do<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.680> so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
aerobic activity the thing to do and so

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.010 
aerobic activity the thing to do and so
this<00:01:23.980> program<00:01:24.250> really<00:01:24.430> came<00:01:25.030> out<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.900> know

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
this program really came out of you know

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.720 
this program really came out of you know
these<00:01:26.230> discussions<00:01:26.890> about<00:01:26.980> how<00:01:27.370> can<00:01:27.640> we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
these discussions about how can we

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.450 
these discussions about how can we
integrate<00:01:27.940> those<00:01:28.750> things<00:01:28.810> together<00:01:29.460> it's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
integrate those things together it's

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.850 
integrate those things together it's
tough<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.360> tough<00:01:31.600> on<00:01:31.750> us<00:01:31.810> it's<00:01:32.440> tough<00:01:32.620> on<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
motivating and there's a rule it's just

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.770 
motivating and there's a rule it's just
more<00:01:55.520> time<00:01:55.720> she's<00:01:56.720> got<00:01:57.080> great<00:01:57.890> energy<00:01:58.130> great

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
a great technical teacher she was really

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.820 
a great technical teacher she was really
through<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.640> keep<00:02:04.790> our<00:02:05.000> movements<00:02:05.570> simple<00:02:06.440> and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
through to keep our movements simple and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.639 
through to keep our movements simple and
effective<00:02:07.600> changing<00:02:08.600> them<00:02:08.810> enough<00:02:09.380> she

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
effective changing them enough she

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.900 
effective changing them enough she
didn't<00:02:10.040> feel<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:10.280> you're<00:02:10.429> holding<00:02:10.729> one

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
didn't feel like you're holding one

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.690 
didn't feel like you're holding one
movement<00:02:11.420> patterns<00:02:11.750> too<00:02:11.960> long<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.950> using<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
movement patterns too long and using the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.700 
movement patterns too long and using the
music<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.300> help<00:02:14.570> keep<00:02:15.080> everybody<00:02:15.530> together

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
music to help keep everybody together

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.660 
music to help keep everybody together
and<00:02:16.430> allowing<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.660> differences<00:02:18.230> between

and allowing the differences between
intensity<00:02:19.670> levels<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.750> vary<00:02:21.080> by<00:02:21.440> much<00:02:22.010> way<00:02:22.190> too

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
intensity levels to vary by much way too

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.250 
intensity levels to vary by much way too
realistic<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.120> know<00:02:23.150> you're<00:02:23.570> really<00:02:23.930> strong

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
realistic you know you're really strong

and<00:02:24.620> you're<00:02:24.800> not<00:02:24.920> doing<00:02:25.160> enough<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.370> let<00:02:25.550> it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
and you're not doing enough to let it

and you're not doing enough to let it
work<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.880> you're<00:02:26.240> not<00:02:26.540> lifting<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
work out you're not lifting and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.900 
work out you're not lifting and
heaviness<00:02:27.350> weight<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.310> if<00:02:28.400> someone's<00:02:28.730> on<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
heaviness weight and if someone's on the

and<00:02:31.370> they<00:02:32.300> are<00:02:32.390> able<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.750> kind<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.080> adapt<00:02:33.380> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and they are able to kind of adapt to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.530 
and they are able to kind of adapt to
the<00:02:33.650> program<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.310> lot<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.970> person<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.270> has<00:02:35.480> a

the program a lot of person that has a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.479 
the program a lot of person that has a
little<00:02:35.750> more<00:02:35.930> sense<00:02:36.140> level<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.950> able<00:02:37.370> to

little more sense level is able to

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.240 
little more sense level is able to
really<00:02:38.140> even<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.350> trainer<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.770> said<00:02:40.040> myself

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
really even as a trainer I said myself

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.790 
really even as a trainer I said myself
trainers<00:02:41.239> trainers<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.350> great<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.680> the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
trainers trainers it's great for the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.740 
trainers trainers it's great for the
program<00:02:46.180> challenge<00:02:47.180> myself

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.400 

it<00:02:50.750> was<00:02:50.930> awesome<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.500> have

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.440 

actually<00:02:55.410> got<00:02:55.560> more<00:02:55.830> muscle<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.520> I'm<00:02:57.210> just

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
actually got more muscle and I'm just

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.010 
actually got more muscle and I'm just
shocked

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
shocked

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.750 
shocked
with<00:02:58.320> all<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> heavy<00:02:58.710> weight<00:02:59.250> lifting<00:02:59.640> up

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
with all the heavy weight lifting up

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.820 
with all the heavy weight lifting up
every<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.240> many<00:03:00.270> years<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:01.080> I'm<00:03:01.620> actually

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
every so many years that I'm actually

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.530 
every so many years that I'm actually
getting<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> result<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.270> did<00:03:03.510> not

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
getting the result that I just did not

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.320 
getting the result that I just did not
anticipate<00:03:04.230> at<00:03:04.950> all<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.580> from<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
anticipate at all so going from the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.560 
anticipate at all so going from the
heavy<00:03:06.870> weight<00:03:07.430> running<00:03:11.060> short<00:03:12.060> higher

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
heavy weight running short higher

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.430 
heavy weight running short higher
intensity<00:03:13.310> bursts<00:03:14.310> are<00:03:15.120> more<00:03:15.540> effective<00:03:16.170> than

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
intensity bursts are more effective than

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.490 
intensity bursts are more effective than
the<00:03:17.160> longer<00:03:17.730> slow<00:03:18.210> steady<00:03:18.840> training<00:03:19.380> that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
the longer slow steady training that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
the longer slow steady training that
we've<00:03:19.620> always<00:03:19.980> been<00:03:20.310> toward<00:03:20.610> over<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.150> over

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
we've always been toward over and over

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420 
we've always been toward over and over
and<00:03:21.450> over<00:03:21.570> again<00:03:21.810> each<00:03:22.290> five-minute<00:03:22.980> segment

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
and over again each five-minute segment

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.370 
and over again each five-minute segment
we<00:03:23.520> finish<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.210> feels<00:03:24.390> like<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> win<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.170> mean

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
we finish it it feels like a win I mean

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.560 
we finish it it feels like a win I mean
each<00:03:25.530> point<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:26.040> exhausting<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.300> need

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
each point is exhausting and you need

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.750 
each point is exhausting and you need
that<00:03:27.750> recovery<00:03:28.260> time<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.710> between<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.460> order

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
that recovery time in between in order

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.720 
that recovery time in between in order
to<00:03:29.820> start<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> next<00:03:30.270> it's<00:03:30.690> far<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> hardest

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
to start the next it's far the hardest

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.550 
to start the next it's far the hardest
and<00:03:32.730> there's<00:03:32.880> times<00:03:33.150> where<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.510> can't<00:03:33.959> finish<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and there's times where I can't finish a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.250 
and there's times where I can't finish a
certain<00:03:35.100> exercise<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.880> that's<00:03:35.970> ok<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:37.170> know

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
certain exercise and that's ok you know

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.500 
certain exercise and that's ok you know
I<00:03:37.290> wanted<00:03:37.830> people<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.250> push<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.940> hard<00:03:39.240> where

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
I wanted people to push that hard where

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.390 
I wanted people to push that hard where
they<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:39.990> had<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.320> take<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.530> moment<00:03:40.830> and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
they just had to take a moment and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.020 
they just had to take a moment and
recruit<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:42.930> jump<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:44.030> when

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
recruit and then just jump back in when

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.480 
recruit and then just jump back in when
we<00:03:45.209> believe<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.020> exercise<00:03:46.530> you

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
we believe that but if you exercise you

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.920 
we believe that but if you exercise you
know<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.730> helps<00:03:48.000> everything<00:03:48.330> else<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.780> you
