00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.710
 but 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.250
 marcello 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.929
 beautiful beautiful 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.929
 there 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.599
 we want to replace one of the most common door closers on the market through i 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.589
 fitting clothes with nails door of roma strength 3 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.460
 first we detach the door closers previously installed 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.330
 yes the screws that fasten 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
 the arm 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
 pepper the body to the door 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.740
 choose 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.680
 in the adaptation kit the suitable fixing plate according to the force of the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.510
 new door closer to install 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.050
 we superimpose lines outside the previous door closers 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.650
 we fix the with the 4 screws supplied 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.380
 then take the cover plate 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 and apply the back of the door closer to make 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 fit the phone 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 then we live with the 4 screws in 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.050
 the new door closer and the cover plate to the fixing plate 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.389
 we then apply the adjustable high port arm 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.389
 eeeeh let's stop it with the d xx sec. 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:35.549
 we fix the base of the arm to the door frame with the two supplied screws 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.519
 finally we tighten with a key of 10 the data that blocks the extension of the 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.060
 adjustable arm then we verify the operation of the door closer 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.689
 if we want the door to remain open for a certain position we must 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.629
 tighten the stop element located in the enamel of the arm 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.309
 have the door opening angle set 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.479
 if the door is closed too fast I can change it too slowly 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.619
 speed by simply adjusting the appropriate valve with a screwdriver 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.749
 located in the door closer body 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.769
 the intensity of the final closing stroke can also be adjusted to 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.319
 same way through the other door closer valve 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.259
 careful they never unscrew the valves completely to avoid doing 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:41.189
 escape hatred by making the door closer useless at this point 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.059
 all that remains is to put the touch on the unused sprocket 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:49.739
 we remind you that you can also be installed in the port 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.179
 upside down or with the arm applied to the door hey closes the door 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:58.049
