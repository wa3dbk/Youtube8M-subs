00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
to know how to make custom logos links

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.910 
to know how to make custom logos links
in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> description<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.480> yeah<00:00:21.800> let's<00:00:22.800> get

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
in the description so yeah let's get

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.150 
in the description so yeah let's get
started<00:00:23.340> now<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.390> cube<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.890> same

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
started now this cube is in the same

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.269 
started now this cube is in the same
know<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.630> much<00:00:27.900> smoother<00:00:28.380> than<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:29.010> normal

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
know it is much smoother than a normal

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.280 
know it is much smoother than a normal
again<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.859> much<00:00:31.859> less<00:00:32.160> clicky<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.360> let<00:00:34.200> me

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
again and much less clicky to so let me

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.370 
again and much less clicky to so let me
just<00:00:34.440> show<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> did<00:00:36.230> basically<00:00:37.230> what

round down this part right here round
down<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.129> side<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:51.079> ran<00:00:52.079> down

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
down the other side right there ran down

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.470 
down the other side right there ran down
this<00:00:52.920> part<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.910> other<00:00:54.059> part<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this part and the other part and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.350 
this part and the other part and
sometimes<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.559> run<00:00:55.710> down<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.760> two

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
sometimes you can run down these two

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
sometimes you can run down these two
side<00:00:57.629> parts<00:00:59.059> ok<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:06.740> what<00:01:07.740> does<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.920> cube

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
side parts ok so what does this cube

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.289 
side parts ok so what does this cube
feel<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.210> cube<00:01:09.750> feel<00:01:10.560> sore<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
feel like now this cube feel sore like a

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
feel like now this cube feel sore like a
normally<00:01:12.299> lublu<00:01:12.960> home<00:01:13.549> like<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.909> a

very smooth not very cliquey so yeah
quarter<00:01:38.790> cutting<00:01:38.970> still<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.110> very<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.829> I'm

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
quarter cutting still not very that I'm

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.219 
quarter cutting still not very that I'm
still<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:41.790> good<00:01:42.470> like<00:01:43.470> half<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> piece

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
still not very good like half a piece

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
still not very good like half a piece
right<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:51.079> first<00:01:52.079> corner<00:01:52.409> cutting<00:01:53.090> up

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
right there first corner cutting up

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
right there first corner cutting up
third<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:55.110> third<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.930> half

Oh like two fifths oh yes um so yeah

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.690 
Oh like two fifths oh yes um so yeah
this<00:02:05.860> cube<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.460> very<00:02:07.000> nice<00:02:07.240> cube<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:08.700> can't

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
this cube is a very nice cube I can't

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.210 
this cube is a very nice cube I can't
really<00:02:09.910> explain<00:02:10.570> it<00:02:10.690> further<00:02:11.080> than<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.650> you

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
really explain it further than that you

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.690 
really explain it further than that you
just<00:02:12.400> have<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.820> mod<00:02:13.060> yourself<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:15.100> yeah

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
just have to do the mod yourself so yeah

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300 
just have to do the mod yourself so yeah
so<00:02:16.660> now<00:02:16.840> we're<00:02:16.990> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> go<00:02:17.200> into<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.770> quick

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
so now we're going to go into a quick

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.370 
so now we're going to go into a quick
test<00:02:18.670> solve<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.120> time<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.440> test<00:02:24.280> solve

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
test solve is so time for the test solve

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.990 
test solve is so time for the test solve
on<00:02:26.380> let's<00:02:26.740> just<00:02:26.800> explain<00:02:27.220> some<00:02:27.430> stuff<00:02:27.550> I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
on let's just explain some stuff I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.830 
on let's just explain some stuff I
average<00:02:28.360> around<00:02:28.570> 40<00:02:28.959> seconds<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.620> used<00:02:29.920> frigate

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
average around 40 seconds I used frigate

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.820 
average around 40 seconds I used frigate
with<00:02:31.840> f2<00:02:32.410> LOL<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.730> PLL<00:02:34.720> well<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.500> look<00:02:35.680> all

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
with f2 LOL and PLL well to look all

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.760 
with f2 LOL and PLL well to look all
along<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.100> tulip<00:02:36.550> PLL<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.350> I'm<00:02:38.350> starting<00:02:38.739> to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
along I'm tulip PLL and I'm starting to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.970 
along I'm tulip PLL and I'm starting to
average<00:02:39.100> rom<00:02:39.340> 37's<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.900> normally<00:02:41.500> Irish

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
average rom 37's but normally Irish

00:02:41.980 --> 00:03:14.010 
average rom 37's but normally Irish
around<00:02:42.730> sub<00:02:43.360> 40s<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.470> let's<00:02:44.820> go

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:42.300 

oh<00:03:39.600> my<00:03:40.600> god<00:03:40.750> okay<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.770> was<00:03:41.890> good<00:03:42.040> solve

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
oh my god okay that was good solve

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.940 
oh my god okay that was good solve
32-point<00:03:43.060> 12<00:03:43.330> it<00:03:43.600> was<00:03:43.750> going<00:03:43.990> to<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.140> 31-point

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
32-point 12 it was going to be 31-point

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.150 
32-point 12 it was going to be 31-point
XX<00:03:45.610> but<00:03:46.450> i<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:48.360> didn't<00:03:49.360> hit<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.570> with<00:03:50.110> my

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
XX but i like didn't hit it with my

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.120 
XX but i like didn't hit it with my
hands<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.340> hit<00:03:51.460> it<00:03:51.550> with<00:03:51.670> my<00:03:51.700> sleeves<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.530> 32

hands I hit it with my sleeves so 32

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.730 
hands I hit it with my sleeves so 32
point<00:03:54.430> 12<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.710> yeah<00:03:56.710> um<00:03:58.260> next<00:03:59.260> video<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.620> going
