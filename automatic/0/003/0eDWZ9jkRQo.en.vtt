00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this project is all about understanding

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.619 
this project is all about understanding
how<00:00:11.039> humans<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.730> robots<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.269> work<00:00:12.299> together

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629

this<00:00:15.599> project<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:16.259> we<00:00:16.500> don't<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> as

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
this project you know we don't see it as

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.850 
this project you know we don't see it as
a<00:00:17.250> question<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.029> know<00:00:18.119> humans<00:00:18.540> or<00:00:18.720> robots

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
a question of you know humans or robots

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.080 
a question of you know humans or robots
humans<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:19.950> robots<00:00:20.160> work<00:00:20.369> very<00:00:20.700> naturally

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
humans and robots work very naturally

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.849 
humans and robots work very naturally
together<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.380> don't<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> work

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
together and they don't have to work

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.890 
together and they don't have to work
just<00:00:23.070> hand<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.550> hand<00:00:23.760> they<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.810> can

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
just hand in hand they can have you can

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.259 
just hand in hand they can have you can
have<00:00:25.019> robots<00:00:25.349> working<00:00:25.560> ahead<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> crew<00:00:26.269> robots

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
have robots working ahead of crew robots

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.580 
have robots working ahead of crew robots
working<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.660> parallel<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.140> crew<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.500> in

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
working in parallel the crew or in

supportive crew and robots working after

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
supportive crew and robots working after
crew<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.990> there's<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.259> whole<00:00:31.470> spectrum<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
crew so there's this whole spectrum of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
crew so there's this whole spectrum of
how<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.210> robots<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:34.019> doing

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

don't<00:00:43.829> call<00:00:44.039> them<00:00:44.190> robots<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:45.000> pick<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
don't call them robots you pick up a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
don't call them robots you pick up a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
them and know if they'll you can ask

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
them and know if they'll you can ask
them<00:00:59.100> questions<00:00:59.160> what's<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> probability<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
them questions what's the probability of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.740 
them questions what's the probability of
snow<00:01:04.039> and<00:01:05.039> that's<00:01:05.610> very<00:01:05.940> much<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> same<00:01:06.450> sort

when<00:01:16.890> astronauts<00:01:17.220> perform<00:01:17.459> tests<00:01:17.910> there's<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
when astronauts perform tests there's a

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.240 
when astronauts perform tests there's a
lot<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> setup<00:01:18.750> before<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.709> task<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.099> actually

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
lot of setup before the task is actually

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
lot of setup before the task is actually
started<00:01:20.819> and<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> lot<00:01:21.149> of<00:01:21.179> teardown<00:01:21.690> after<00:01:22.050> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
started and a lot of teardown after the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.779 
started and a lot of teardown after the
task<00:01:22.349> is<00:01:22.530> done<00:01:22.679> particularly<00:01:23.399> on<00:01:23.490> Space

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
variety of equipment if a robot can

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.410 
variety of equipment if a robot can
perform<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.800> task<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.700> allows<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> crew

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
perform that task it allows the crew

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.180 
perform that task it allows the crew
person<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:31.410> more<00:01:31.560> efficient<00:01:31.979> doing

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
person to be much more efficient doing

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.800 
person to be much more efficient doing
the<00:01:32.280> things<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> only<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.940> crew<00:01:33.209> person<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the things that only a crew person can

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.779 
the things that only a crew person can
do<00:01:33.929> yeah<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.800> one<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.069> interesting<00:01:35.429> robots

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
do yeah so one of the interesting robots

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.160 
do yeah so one of the interesting robots
were<00:01:35.910> working<00:01:36.179> with<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.569> system<00:01:36.959> called

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
were working with is a system called

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.219 
were working with is a system called
spheres<00:01:37.880> MIT<00:01:38.880> developed<00:01:39.569> this<00:01:39.690> about<00:01:40.020> 10

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
spheres MIT developed this about 10

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.199 
spheres MIT developed this about 10
years<00:01:40.380> ago<00:01:40.550> they've<00:01:41.550> actually<00:01:41.640> had<00:01:41.849> three<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
years ago they've actually had three of

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.540 
years ago they've actually had three of
these<00:01:42.360> volleyball<00:01:43.200> sized<00:01:43.619> free-flying

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
these volleyball sized free-flying

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.699 
these volleyball sized free-flying
robots<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.149> station<00:01:45.660> for<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.959> past<00:01:46.170> four

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
robots on station for the past four

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.589 
robots on station for the past four
years<00:01:46.739> and<00:01:47.580> what<00:01:47.789> we're<00:01:47.940> doing<00:01:48.179> right<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.330> is

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
years and what we're doing right now is

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.779 
years and what we're doing right now is
is<00:01:48.780> adding<00:01:49.200> an<00:01:49.380> upgrade<00:01:49.739> to<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.160> free

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
is adding an upgrade to these free

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.130 
is adding an upgrade to these free
flyers<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.509> originally<00:01:51.899> made<00:01:52.110> as

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
flyers they're originally made as

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380 
flyers they're originally made as
satellites<00:01:52.830> we've<00:01:53.459> added<00:01:53.610> actually<00:01:53.910> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
satellites we've added actually a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.960 
satellites we've added actually a
smartphone<00:01:55.020> sort<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.099> brain<00:01:56.340> upgrade<00:01:56.640> if

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
smartphone sort of a brain upgrade if

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.550 
smartphone sort of a brain upgrade if
you<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.209> think<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.509> way<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.349> give

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you want to think of it that way to give

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.130 
you want to think of it that way to give
them<00:01:58.709> cameras<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.580> onboard<00:01:59.970> sensing<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
them cameras and onboard sensing and a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.710 
them cameras and onboard sensing and a
Wi-Fi<00:02:01.619> connection<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.849> we<00:02:02.910> can<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.330> not

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
Wi-Fi connection so now we can have not

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.419 
Wi-Fi connection so now we can have not
just<00:02:03.899> us<00:02:04.050> free<00:02:04.349> flying<00:02:04.530> satellite<00:02:05.039> but<00:02:05.310> our

agile very capable and what it can do in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.199 
agile very capable and what it can do in
terms<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.129> way<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.370> works<00:02:28.519> with<00:02:28.670> forces

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
terms of the way it works with forces

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.630 
terms of the way it works with forces
and<00:02:29.769> being<00:02:30.769> able<00:02:30.829> to<00:02:31.010> pick<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.609> move

and being able to pick up and move

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.819 
and being able to pick up and move
things<00:02:31.939> around<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> we're<00:02:33.379> trying<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.709> make

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
things around so we're trying to make

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.039 
things around so we're trying to make
use<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.010> Robonaut<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.579> to<00:02:34.700> do<00:02:34.849> things<00:02:35.090> that

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
use of Robonaut to to do things that

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.780 
use of Robonaut to to do things that
humans<00:02:36.469> currently<00:02:36.799> have<00:02:36.889> to<00:02:36.950> do<00:02:37.099> those

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
humans currently have to do those

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.390 
humans currently have to do those
routine<00:02:38.209> very<00:02:38.719> repetitive<00:02:39.159> perhaps<00:02:40.159> long

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
routine very repetitive perhaps long

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.280 
routine very repetitive perhaps long
duration<00:02:40.939> tasks<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.629> you<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.900> need<00:02:42.079> to<00:02:42.170> get

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
duration tasks that you just need to get

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.559 
duration tasks that you just need to get
done<00:02:42.530> things<00:02:42.889> such<00:02:43.129> as<00:02:43.159> say<00:02:43.909> filter<00:02:44.269> change

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
done things such as say filter change

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.500 
done things such as say filter change
out<00:02:44.980> basic<00:02:45.980> maintenance<00:02:46.250> these<00:02:47.060> are<00:02:47.209> classic

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
out basic maintenance these are classic

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.970 
out basic maintenance these are classic
things<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:47.780> require<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.109> human<00:02:48.560> level

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
things that require a human level

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.309 
things that require a human level
dexterity<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.389> very<00:02:50.599> first<00:02:50.840> time<00:02:51.109> we

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
dexterity and for the very first time we

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.720 
dexterity and for the very first time we
have<00:02:51.439> a<00:02:51.470> robot<00:02:51.859> that<00:02:51.889> actually<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.430> do<00:02:52.549> those

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
have a robot that actually can do those

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.720 
have a robot that actually can do those
things<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.840> hopefully<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:55.099> project<00:02:55.549> will

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
things so hopefully this project will

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.659 
things so hopefully this project will
lower<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.329> workload<00:02:56.689> on<00:02:56.810> crew<00:02:57.370> there's<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.430> lot

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
lower the workload on crew there's a lot

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.009 
lower the workload on crew there's a lot
of<00:02:58.819> tasks<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.419> they<00:02:59.569> do<00:02:59.629> that<00:02:59.900> are<00:02:59.989> very

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
of tasks that they do that are very

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.890 
of tasks that they do that are very
boring<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:00.799> dull<00:03:01.060> one<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.389> they<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.659> to

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
boring in dull one is that they have to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.379 
boring in dull one is that they have to
take<00:03:03.290> radiological<00:03:04.159> sensors<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:05.269> around

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
take radiological sensors and go around

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.089 
take radiological sensors and go around
the<00:03:05.599> station<00:03:05.989> essentially<00:03:06.829> measuring

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
the station essentially measuring

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.520 
the station essentially measuring
radiation<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.389> other<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.689> audio<00:03:09.019> dissymmetry

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
radiation the other is audio dissymmetry

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.629 
radiation the other is audio dissymmetry
so<00:03:09.799> they<00:03:09.859> have<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.040> figure<00:03:10.219> out<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.400> amount<00:03:10.519> of

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
so they have to figure out the amount of

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.789 
so they have to figure out the amount of
noise<00:03:11.000> on<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.419> station<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.349> hope<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.769> that

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
noise on the station the hope is that

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.920 
noise on the station the hope is that
much<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:13.579> your<00:03:13.730> Roomba<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.359> can<00:03:14.510> turn<00:03:14.689> it<00:03:14.840> on

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
much like your Roomba you can turn it on

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.089 
much like your Roomba you can turn it on
and<00:03:15.139> it<00:03:15.230> will<00:03:15.260> run<00:03:15.439> around<00:03:15.560> your<00:03:15.889> house<00:03:16.069> and

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
and it will run around your house and

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.490 
and it will run around your house and
clean<00:03:16.459> your<00:03:16.609> your<00:03:16.969> house<00:03:17.209> for<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.659> that<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
clean your your house for you that the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.229 
clean your your house for you that the
sphere<00:03:18.859> would<00:03:19.099> eventually<00:03:19.400> be<00:03:19.700> able<00:03:19.849> to<00:03:20.000> fly

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
sphere would eventually be able to fly

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.819 
sphere would eventually be able to fly
around<00:03:20.510> station<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.079> do<00:03:21.200> some<00:03:21.409> of<00:03:21.439> these<00:03:21.560> dull

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
around station and do some of these dull

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.189 
around station and do some of these dull
tasks<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.519> astronauts<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.599> there<00:03:24.019> are<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.109> lot

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
tasks for astronauts and there are a lot

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.509 
tasks for astronauts and there are a lot
of<00:03:24.229> good<00:03:24.500> reasons<00:03:24.859> for<00:03:24.919> wanting<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.310> use

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
of good reasons for wanting to use

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.580 
of good reasons for wanting to use
robots<00:03:25.909> in<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.269> VA<00:03:26.419> it<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.139> a<00:03:27.169> dangerous

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
robots in a VA it is a dangerous

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.649 
robots in a VA it is a dangerous
environment<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:28.909> a<00:03:28.940> place<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.209> requires

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
environment it is a place that requires

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.199 
environment it is a place that requires
the<00:03:29.900> use<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.109> lots<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.919> oxygen<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.639> other

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
the use of lots of oxygen and other

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.929 
the use of lots of oxygen and other
things<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:33.260> we<00:03:33.979> can't<00:03:34.220> easily<00:03:34.430> replace

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
things that we can't easily replace

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.449 
things that we can't easily replace
especially<00:03:35.359> on<00:03:35.419> a<00:03:35.479> deep<00:03:35.629> space<00:03:35.689> mission<00:03:35.949> so<00:03:36.949> if

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
especially on a deep space mission so if

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.129 
especially on a deep space mission so if
we're<00:03:37.609> able<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:37.879> create<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.120> robot<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.989> do

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
we're able to create a robot that can do

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.319 
we're able to create a robot that can do
some<00:03:39.439> of<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.620> work<00:03:39.680> in<00:03:39.949> a<00:03:40.069> VA<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.909> has<00:03:41.090> huge

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
some of this work in a VA that has huge

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.719 
some of this work in a VA that has huge
benefits<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.019> human<00:03:42.590> exploration<00:03:42.859> this

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
benefits to human exploration this

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.939 
benefits to human exploration this
project<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.299> really<00:03:44.659> meant<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.049> look<00:03:45.229> at<00:03:45.439> how

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
project is really meant to look at how

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.520 
project is really meant to look at how
do<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.189> best<00:03:47.060> use<00:03:47.359> robots<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.900> improve<00:03:48.290> human

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
do you best use robots to improve human

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.289 
do you best use robots to improve human
exploration<00:03:49.129> especially<00:03:49.819> for<00:03:50.000> deep<00:03:50.150> space

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
exploration especially for deep space

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.240 
exploration especially for deep space
missions<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.079> one<00:03:51.829> of<00:03:51.919> the<00:03:51.979> things<00:03:52.129> we're

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
missions and one of the things we're

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.009 
missions and one of the things we're
really<00:03:52.280> trying<00:03:52.729> to<00:03:52.790> do<00:03:52.909> is<00:03:52.939> make<00:03:53.449> sure<00:03:53.479> that

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
really trying to do is make sure that

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.020 
really trying to do is make sure that
the<00:03:54.620> robotic<00:03:55.069> Hardware<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.759> robotic

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
the robotic Hardware the robotic

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.699 
the robotic Hardware the robotic
software<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.109> way<00:03:57.199> we<00:03:57.349> operate<00:03:57.470> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
software and the way we operate the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.339 
software and the way we operate the
robots<00:03:58.069> is<00:03:58.280> really<00:03:58.699> appropriate<00:03:59.599> for<00:03:59.870> looking

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
robots is really appropriate for looking

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.770 
robots is really appropriate for looking
at<00:04:00.470> future<00:04:00.769> missions<00:04:01.120> our<00:04:02.120> tests<00:04:02.509> over<00:04:02.659> the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
at future missions our tests over the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.990 
at future missions our tests over the
next<00:04:03.019> two<00:04:03.439> years<00:04:03.470> really<00:04:03.979> are<00:04:04.489> designed<00:04:04.790> to

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
next two years really are designed to

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.580 
next two years really are designed to
help<00:04:05.150> us<00:04:05.329> understand<00:04:05.930> what<00:04:06.079> are<00:04:06.290> all<00:04:06.439> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
help us understand what are all the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.860 
help us understand what are all the
issues<00:04:06.949> associated<00:04:07.310> with<00:04:07.669> using<00:04:08.239> robots<00:04:08.689> for

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
issues associated with using robots for

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.259 
issues associated with using robots for
human<00:04:09.109> spaceflight<00:04:09.729> having<00:04:10.729> robots<00:04:11.060> work

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
human spaceflight having robots work

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.839 
human spaceflight having robots work
with<00:04:11.449> humans<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.919> think<00:04:13.189> really<00:04:13.459> all<00:04:13.759> of

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
with humans and so I think really all of

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.089 
with humans and so I think really all of
our<00:04:13.970> testing<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.329> driven<00:04:14.540> by<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.500> our<00:04:15.799> desire

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
our testing is driven by and our desire

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.800 
our testing is driven by and our desire
to<00:04:16.310> create<00:04:16.459> systems<00:04:16.699> that<00:04:17.060> really<00:04:17.449> improve

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
to create systems that really improve

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.360 
to create systems that really improve
the<00:04:17.989> way<00:04:18.079> that<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:18.289> as<00:04:18.650> humans<00:04:18.979> can<00:04:19.039> go<00:04:19.190> out<00:04:19.280> and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the way that we as humans can go out and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:29.959 
the way that we as humans can go out and
explore<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:20.060> solar<00:04:20.570> system

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.029
