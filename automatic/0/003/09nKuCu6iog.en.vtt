00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and if you push the spring clip it pulls

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.269 
and if you push the spring clip it pulls
out<00:00:27.659> so<00:00:27.989> let's<00:00:28.319> have<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.739> a<00:00:28.890> wrestle

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
this spring clip in here which allowed

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.979 
this spring clip in here which allowed
me<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.530> pop<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.920> lamp<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.460> okay<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.210> on

there we go all right em see that I see

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.630 
there we go all right em see that I see
how<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> works<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.410> press<00:01:20.190> down<00:01:20.430> on

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
how that works you can press down on

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.110 
how that works you can press down on
this<00:01:20.790> section<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.080> you've<00:01:22.290> got<00:01:22.410> this<00:01:22.560> little

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
this section and you've got this little

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.340 
this section and you've got this little
fork<00:01:24.120> there<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.570> does<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.230> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
fork there that does that and it's the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:37.850 
fork there that does that and it's the
same<00:01:25.590> deal<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.220> side<00:01:35.840> all<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:36.870> there

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
same deal on this side all right there

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.880 
same deal on this side all right there
we<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.100> okay<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.790> separate<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> there

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
we go okay and as we separate that there

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
we go okay and as we separate that there
that's<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.310> unit<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.420> you'll<00:01:45.540> need<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.810> take

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that's the unit so you'll need to take

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
that's the unit so you'll need to take
the<00:01:46.050> unit<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.650> completely<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.640> change<00:01:47.910> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the unit out completely to change the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.750 
the unit out completely to change the
bulbs<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.910> then<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> bulbs<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
bulbs like so and then the bulbs then I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.120 
bulbs like so and then the bulbs then I
just<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:53.880> bayonet<00:01:54.390> fit<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.470> push<00:01:55.770> them<00:01:55.980> in

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
just you bayonet fit so you push them in

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
just you bayonet fit so you push them in
and<00:01:56.930> wiggle<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.050> out<00:01:58.230> okay<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.330> I<00:02:00.330> put<00:02:00.660> them

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and wiggle them out okay so I put them

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
and wiggle them out okay so I put them
back<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.320> twist<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
back in and twist them and then the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.720 
back in and twist them and then the
