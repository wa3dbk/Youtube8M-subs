00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
so pretty much what you do is you just

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.310 
so pretty much what you do is you just
place<00:00:32.669> blocks<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:35.399> area<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.140> down<00:00:37.140> in

place blocks in the area and down in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.880 
place blocks in the area and down in
this<00:00:37.410> area<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.040> makes<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.610> beat<00:00:38.940> sound<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.170> up

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
this area it makes a beat sound and up

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.020 
this area it makes a beat sound and up
here<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.370> makes<00:00:41.550> um<00:00:42.050> an<00:00:43.050> actual<00:00:43.350> note<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.129> may

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

and<00:04:58.640> then<00:04:58.760> go<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.060> another<00:04:59.240> screen<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.230> then<00:05:00.770> I

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
and then go to another screen and then I

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.760 
and then go to another screen and then I
think<00:05:01.790> that<00:05:02.030> one's<00:05:02.240> called<00:05:02.450> beat<00:05:02.810> wave<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.710> you

think that one's called beat wave so you

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.140 
think that one's called beat wave so you
should<00:05:04.250> just<00:05:05.180> go<00:05:05.570> check<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:05.930> out<00:05:05.990> um<00:05:06.970> so<00:05:07.970> yeah

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
should just go check that out um so yeah

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.880
