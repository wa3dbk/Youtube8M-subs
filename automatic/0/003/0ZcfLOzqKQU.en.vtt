00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020 

I<00:00:00.240> just<00:00:00.750> watched<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.260> short<00:00:01.920> video<00:00:02.190> doesn't

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
I just watched a short video doesn't

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.510 
I just watched a short video doesn't
really<00:00:03.470> prove<00:00:04.470> anything<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:05.040> just<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.370> bunch

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
really prove anything it's just a bunch

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.080 
really prove anything it's just a bunch
of<00:00:05.670> texts<00:00:06.029> going<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.480> telling<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.140> story<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:08.090> but

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
of texts going on telling a story on but

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.080 
of texts going on telling a story on but
this<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> kind<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.559> that's<00:00:10.980> real<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this is the kind of that's real and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.020 
this is the kind of that's real and
look<00:00:12.330> at<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> states<00:00:12.870> it's<00:00:13.200> all<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:14.030> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
look at the states it's all about the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.260 
look at the states it's all about the
Philadelphia<00:00:15.900> Experiment<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> also

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
Philadelphia Experiment on which is also

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.679 
Philadelphia Experiment on which is also
known<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.230> project<00:00:19.800> rainbow<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.689> they

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
known as the project rainbow and they

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.689 
known as the project rainbow and they
were<00:00:21.750> using<00:00:22.189> magnetics<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:24.470> I<00:00:25.470> understand<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
were using magnetics and I understand a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.400 
were using magnetics and I understand a
fair<00:00:27.090> bit<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.480> magnetics<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
fair bit about magnetics and the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.990 
fair bit about magnetics and the
potential<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.099> magnetics<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:30.869> on

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
potential that magnetics can can do on

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
potential that magnetics can can do on
some<00:00:33.000> people<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.630> involved<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
some people that are involved with it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.760 
some people that are involved with it
it's<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> pretty<00:00:36.480> dangerous<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it's like is a pretty dangerous to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's like is a pretty dangerous to
be<00:00:37.800> fooling<00:00:38.280> around<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.210> fully

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
be fooling around with you don't fully

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
be fooling around with you don't fully
understand<00:00:40.050> magnetism<00:00:41.780> but<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.760> personally

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
understand magnetism but I personally

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.170 
understand magnetism but I personally
believe<00:00:45.300> there's<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> truth<00:00:47.180> within

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
believe there's a lot of truth within

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.549 
believe there's a lot of truth within
this<00:00:48.510> video<00:00:49.500> only<00:00:50.570> because<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
this video only because I know some of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.590 
this video only because I know some of
the<00:00:52.710> potential<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.789> magnets<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the potential that magnets can do and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
the potential that magnets can do and
this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.660> probably<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:59.100> real<00:00:59.399> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
this is probably really really real that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.119 
this is probably really really real that
if<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.090> he<00:01:00.239> leaks<00:01:00.480> actually<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:01.350> expose<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> lot

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
if we he leaks actually did expose a lot

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
if we he leaks actually did expose a lot
of<00:01:02.280> technology<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.960> check<00:01:04.260> out

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of technology this was like check out

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.490 
of technology this was like check out
the<00:01:04.619> year<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:06.600> stuff<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.229> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the year that this stuff was going on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.120 
the year that this stuff was going on
when<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> atomic<00:01:08.430> bomb<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:09.049> started<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.229> lot

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
when the atomic bomb was started a lot

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.120 
when the atomic bomb was started a lot
of<00:01:11.430> technology<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.799> are

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
of technology is out there that we are

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.880 
of technology is out there that we are
not<00:01:14.340> aware<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> they're<00:01:15.750> keeping<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
not aware of they're keeping a lot of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.490 
not aware of they're keeping a lot of
things<00:01:17.100> secret<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> while<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.200> may<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
things secret and while they may have

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
things secret and while they may have
had<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> failed<00:01:20.280> experiment<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.570> like

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
had a failed experiment it's not like

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.760 
had a failed experiment it's not like
they<00:01:21.990> didn't<00:01:22.380> try<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> improve<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:27.770> while

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
they didn't try to improve it and while

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
they didn't try to improve it and while
there's<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.159> lots<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.549> signs<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.390> I'm

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
there's just lots of signs that I'm

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.280 
there's just lots of signs that I'm
seeing<00:01:31.369> we<00:01:32.369> lease<00:01:32.729> unfolds<00:01:33.360> some<00:01:33.570> technology

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
seeing we lease unfolds some technology

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.340 
seeing we lease unfolds some technology
that<00:01:34.320> we're<00:01:34.770> being<00:01:35.009> told<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.030> in

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
that we're being told is just in

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.710 
that we're being told is just in
experimental<00:01:37.350> stage<00:01:37.619> knew<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
experimental stage knew a lot of this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
experimental stage knew a lot of this
technology<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> way<00:01:40.920> beyond<00:01:41.450> experimental

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
technology is way beyond experimental

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
technology is way beyond experimental
it's<00:01:42.720> already<00:01:43.320> being<00:01:43.560> developed<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it's already being developed but as it's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.179 
it's already being developed but as it's
being<00:01:45.600> introduced<00:01:46.259> into<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> world<00:01:46.979> it's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
being introduced into the world it's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.149 
being introduced into the world it's
going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> look<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.670> oh<00:01:48.060> we're<00:01:48.540> just

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
going to look like oh we're just

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to look like oh we're just
experimenting<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.399> find<00:01:50.430> something<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.450> they

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
experimenting to find something out they

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.929 
experimenting to find something out they
already<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.740> how<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> make<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> work<00:01:53.549> they

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
already know how to make a work they

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.359 
already know how to make a work they
just<00:01:54.180> got<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.479> introduce<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.500> stuff<00:01:55.979> very

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
just got to introduce some stuff very

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.969 
just got to introduce some stuff very
very<00:01:56.759> slowly<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> likes<00:02:00.829> some<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
very slowly and so it likes some of the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.910 
very slowly and so it likes some of the
stuff<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.820> coming<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.299> China<00:02:03.920> that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
stuff that's coming out of China that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550 
stuff that's coming out of China that
doesn't<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.909> development<00:02:06.479> stage<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.049> call

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
doesn't just in development stage I call

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.029 
doesn't just in development stage I call
 on<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> which<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.739> like

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
 on that which kind of is like

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
 on that which kind of is like
how<00:02:11.790> much<00:02:12.030> information<00:02:12.930> with

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
how much information with

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.619 
how much information with
government<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.099> we<00:02:14.310> he<00:02:14.519> leaks<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.000> unfolding

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
government that we he leaks is unfolding

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.199 
government that we he leaks is unfolding
is<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:16.290> true<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.980> mean<00:02:17.549> maybe<00:02:17.730> some<00:02:18.120> of

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
is actually true I mean maybe some of

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.479 
is actually true I mean maybe some of
this<00:02:18.329> stuff<00:02:18.629> has<00:02:18.900> been<00:02:19.140> there<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.459> case

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
this stuff has been there just in case

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.819 
this stuff has been there just in case
somebody<00:02:21.209> wanted<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.260> release<00:02:22.560> information

to make things look like it's just at an
experimental<00:02:26.939> stage<00:02:27.590> way<00:02:28.590> too<00:02:28.650> much<00:02:29.159> as<00:02:29.989> we've

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
experimental stage way too much as we've

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.670 
experimental stage way too much as we've
known<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.620> years<00:02:31.680> years<00:02:32.280> years<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:34.019> how

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
known for years years years we know how

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.069 
known for years years years we know how
to<00:02:34.739> make<00:02:34.920> free<00:02:35.280> energy<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.940> nobody's<00:02:36.629> grasp

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
to make free energy and nobody's grasp

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.470 
to make free energy and nobody's grasp
in<00:02:37.409> that<00:02:37.560> reality<00:02:37.920> because<00:02:38.610> they<00:02:39.180> don't<00:02:39.420> know

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
in that reality because they don't know

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930 
in that reality because they don't know
how<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.890> economically<00:02:40.890> profit<00:02:41.489> off<00:02:41.609> of<00:02:41.640> that

from<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.530> technology<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.549> see<00:03:56.879> this<00:03:57.510> is

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
from the technology that I see this is

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.069 
from the technology that I see this is
more<00:03:57.959> true<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.530> would<00:03:58.829> believe<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.669> on<00:04:00.079> as

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
more true I would believe this on as

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.770 
more true I would believe this on as
wild<00:04:01.859> as<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.609> believe<00:04:02.790> that's<00:04:03.449> what<00:04:03.659> they

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
wild as it is I believe that's what they

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.379 
wild as it is I believe that's what they
were<00:04:03.840> working<00:04:04.139> on<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:05.280> know<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.150> has

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
were working on and I know it has

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.039 
were working on and I know it has
surpassed<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:09.000> know<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.359> years<00:04:09.720> that

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
surpassed and you know in years that

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.899 
surpassed and you know in years that
have<00:04:10.199> passed<00:04:10.379> on<00:04:10.769> by<00:04:10.979> but<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.549> just<00:04:11.760> don't

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
have passed on by but you just don't

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.809 
have passed on by but you just don't
know<00:04:12.120> about<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:13.500> lot<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.829> us<00:04:14.069> i<00:04:14.370> think<00:04:14.400> is

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
know about it and a lot of us i think is

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.029 
know about it and a lot of us i think is
going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.150> be<00:04:15.180> tied<00:04:15.479> to<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> UFOs
