00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
people and it's pretty inexpensive I

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.830 
people and it's pretty inexpensive I
think<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.400> only<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.879> six<00:02:33.299> dollars<00:02:33.660> or

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
think it was only like six dollars or

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.860 
think it was only like six dollars or
something<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:35.250> seven<00:02:35.610> dollars<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.629> think

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
something or seven dollars but I think

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.030 
something or seven dollars but I think
