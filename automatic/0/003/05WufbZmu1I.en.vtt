break it down the way I do it is I
usually<00:01:00.329> grab<00:01:00.660> right<00:01:00.930> by<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.280> hold<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
usually grab right by the I hold the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.660 
usually grab right by the I hold the
mantle<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:04.020> just<00:01:04.229> pull<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.890> smooth

mantle and then just pull in one smooth

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
mantle and then just pull in one smooth
motion<00:01:06.290> when<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.410> do<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.800> you're<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
motion when you do that you're going to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
motion when you do that you're going to
get<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.900> body<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.650> stays

get the all the body be kind of stays

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
get the all the body be kind of stays
connected<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> mantle<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
connected we have the mantle here what I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.290

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
I thought it was actually a piece of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.200 
I thought it was actually a piece of
plastic<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.819> of<00:01:35.850> pretty<00:01:36.030> cool
