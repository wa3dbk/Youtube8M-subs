I'm gonna put the pin so for anything
I've<00:01:11.970> been<00:01:12.000> doing<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.420> wrong<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.439> many

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I've been doing this wrong for so many

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.240 
I've been doing this wrong for so many
years

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
years

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
years
so<00:01:14.549> don't<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> put<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.930> PIN<00:01:16.140> like

horizontally<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:18.000> stuck<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
horizontally it's gonna get stuck in the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.300 
horizontally it's gonna get stuck in the
threads<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> scarf<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.530> ruin<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:19.860> scarf

and then you can like secure the sides
with<00:01:35.909> some<00:01:36.119> straight<00:01:36.479> pins<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> want<00:01:38.270> they

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.190 
side boom maybe bring it to the middle
and<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.819> one<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> pictures<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> had<00:02:12.690> posted

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and in one of the pictures I had posted

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.350 
and in one of the pictures I had posted
on<00:02:13.519> Instagram<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.549> was<00:02:14.760> wearing<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> same

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
on Instagram I was wearing the same

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.699 
on Instagram I was wearing the same
scarf<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> different<00:02:16.290> color

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
scarf in a different color

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.900 
scarf in a different color
so<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> had<00:02:17.610> done<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.030> got<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.690> side<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
so what I had done is I got the side and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.970 
so what I had done is I got the side and
then<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.239> took<00:02:21.299> it<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.560> really

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
then I took it back and this is really

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.259 
then I took it back and this is really
nice<00:02:23.160> because<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.610> gives<00:02:23.640> some<00:02:24.000> chest

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
nice because it gives some chest

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.740 
nice because it gives some chest
coverage<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:27.180> mean<00:02:27.599> it's<00:02:27.720> just

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
coverage and so then I mean it's just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.650 
coverage and so then I mean it's just
like<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> little<00:02:28.260> triangle<00:02:28.470> here<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.660> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
like a little triangle here and then you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.140 
like a little triangle here and then you
can<00:02:30.840> take<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.420> tuck<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.599> back<00:02:33.840> in

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150
