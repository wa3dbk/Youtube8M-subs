00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
interrupt and it's vulnerable to block

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.880

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.610 
vulnerable to interrupts and you could
use<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.969> after<00:02:49.329> slip<00:02:49.599> shot<00:02:49.840> jump<00:02:50.200> shot<00:02:50.409> and

melee button and then hold the melee
button<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.359> does<00:04:19.659> interrupt<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.500> it's

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
button and is it does interrupt and it's

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.320 
button and is it does interrupt and it's
horrible<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:21.130> block<00:04:21.400> now<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:22.090> isn't

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
horrible to block now this isn't

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.589 
horrible to block now this isn't
actually<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.900> juggle<00:04:23.560> move<00:04:23.830> it's<00:04:24.130> pretty<00:04:24.370> cool

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
actually a juggle move it's pretty cool

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.960 
actually a juggle move it's pretty cool
if<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.409> sparring<00:04:26.949> target<00:04:27.400> was<00:04:27.550> working

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
if the sparring target was working

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.180 
if the sparring target was working
correctly<00:04:28.120> he<00:04:28.539> will<00:04:28.690> be<00:04:28.810> jumped<00:04:29.770> into<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.159> air

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
correctly he will be jumped into the air

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.659 
correctly he will be jumped into the air
or<00:04:30.699> thrown<00:04:31.570> into<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.840> air<00:04:31.960> really<00:04:32.220> there<00:04:33.220> say

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
or thrown into the air really there say

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.680 
or thrown into the air really there say
it<00:04:34.060> would<00:04:34.210> have<00:04:34.300> worked

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
it would have worked

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.529 
it would have worked
all<00:04:35.380> right<00:04:35.560> after<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.039> is<00:04:36.340> lost<00:04:36.820> shot<00:04:37.180> you

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
all right after that is lost shot you

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.570 
all right after that is lost shot you
will<00:04:37.690> tap<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.930> melee<00:04:38.380> button<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.979> then<00:04:39.280> hold

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
will tap the melee button and then hold

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.370 
will tap the melee button and then hold
the<00:04:39.729> melee<00:04:40.000> button<00:04:40.300> twice<00:04:40.539> this<00:04:41.139> does

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
the melee button twice this does

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.730 
the melee button twice this does
interrupt<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.490> vulnerable<00:04:42.909> to<00:04:42.970> block

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
interrupt and it is vulnerable to block

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.450 
interrupt and it is vulnerable to block
so<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.099> going<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.400> be<00:04:45.550> lifting<00:04:46.060> shot<00:04:46.419> and

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
so this is going to be lifting shot and

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.060 
so this is going to be lifting shot and
ending<00:04:48.460> with<00:04:48.700> lost<00:04:49.360> shot<00:04:49.599> for<00:04:49.840> more<00:04:50.110> juggling

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
ending with lost shot for more juggling

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.110 
ending with lost shot for more juggling
and<00:04:51.160> so<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.030> can<00:04:52.270> see<00:04:52.420> it<00:04:52.540> just<00:04:52.780> right<00:04:52.960> there

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
and so you can see it just right there

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.230 
and so you can see it just right there
pretty<00:04:55.120> cool<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:56.310> then<00:04:57.310> last<00:04:57.700> but<00:04:57.820> not<00:04:57.970> least

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
pretty cool and then last but not least

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.780 
pretty cool and then last but not least
is<00:04:58.510> sweep<00:04:58.900> shot<00:04:59.260> for<00:04:59.800> sweep<00:04:59.980> shot<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.400> tap<00:05:00.640> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
is sweep shot for sweep shot you tap the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.670 
is sweep shot for sweep shot you tap the
mail<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:01.060> button<00:05:01.330> twice<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.870> then<00:05:02.140> hold<00:05:02.530> the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
mail a button twice and then hold the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.040 
mail a button twice and then hold the
mail<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.890> button<00:05:03.280> this<00:05:03.850> does<00:05:04.150> interrupt<00:05:04.780> and

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
mail a button this does interrupt and

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.540 
mail a button this does interrupt and
it's<00:05:05.200> vulnerable<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.680> block<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:06.160> this<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.430> a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
it's vulnerable to block and this is a

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.750 
it's vulnerable to block and this is a
front<00:05:06.880> tool<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.570> front<00:05:07.960> cone<00:05:08.260> AOE<00:05:08.760> so

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
front tool this is a front cone AOE so

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.190 
front tool this is a front cone AOE so
it<00:05:09.850> does<00:05:10.000> hit<00:05:10.240> multiple<00:05:10.750> targets<00:05:11.550> like<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:16.200> may

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
it does hit multiple targets like so may

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.800 
it does hit multiple targets like so may
using<00:05:17.560> dual<00:05:17.740> pistols<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.250> pretty<00:05:19.030> fun<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:19.660> say

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
using dual pistols is pretty fun to say

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.400 
using dual pistols is pretty fun to say
the<00:05:19.930> least

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410
