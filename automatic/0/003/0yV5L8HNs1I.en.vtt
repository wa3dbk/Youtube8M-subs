refrigeration<00:00:47.390> necessary<00:00:48.390> until<00:00:48.690> opened<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
refrigeration necessary until opened so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
refrigeration necessary until opened so
it's<00:00:49.890> fully<00:00:50.130> cooked<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:51.540> need
