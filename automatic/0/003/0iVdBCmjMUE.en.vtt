episode is all about the Vesta AI
creatively<00:00:05.580> named<00:00:05.910> because<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.810> an<00:00:06.960> NCIX

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
creatively named because it is an NCIX

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.360 
creatively named because it is an NCIX
Vesta<00:00:08.309> pc<00:00:08.730> which<00:00:09.000> all<00:00:09.269> NCIX<00:00:09.840> pcs<00:00:10.320> are<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
Vesta pc which all NCIX pcs are and it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.539 
Vesta pc which all NCIX pcs are and it
is<00:00:11.490> all<00:00:11.759> Intel<00:00:12.690> hence<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> AI<00:00:13.650> name<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.400> we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is all Intel hence the AI name so we

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.550 
is all Intel hence the AI name so we
have<00:00:14.849> decked<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.690> machine<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.410> as

have decked this machine out with as
many<00:00:16.590> Intel<00:00:17.369> components<00:00:17.940> as<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.150> possibly<00:00:18.390> can

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
many Intel components as we possibly can

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
many Intel components as we possibly can
you<00:00:19.350> want<00:00:19.560> an<00:00:19.650> intel-based<00:00:20.100> machine<00:00:20.760> that's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
capable DVD writer so what's cool about

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.070 
capable DVD writer so what's cool about
m<00:01:07.500> disc<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.729> use<00:01:08.760> em<00:01:09.360> disc<00:01:09.720> media

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
m disc is that if you use em disc media

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.490 
m disc is that if you use em disc media
you<00:01:10.350> will<00:01:10.530> never<00:01:11.040> lose<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.000> day<00:01:12.659> day<00:01:12.840> cannot

degrade over time even over thousands of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.480 
degrade over time even over thousands of
years<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> neat<00:01:17.009> however<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
years so that's kind of neat however it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.679 
years so that's kind of neat however it
is<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.790> bit<00:01:17.939> expensive<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.479> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
is a little bit expensive but it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
is a little bit expensive but it's
definitely<00:01:19.020> archival<00:01:19.890> grade<00:01:20.130> you've<00:01:20.640> got

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
definitely archival grade you've got

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
definitely archival grade you've got
