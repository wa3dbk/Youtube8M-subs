probably only two things that stood out

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.450 
probably only two things that stood out
for<00:04:37.060> me<00:04:37.120> like<00:04:37.509> i<00:04:38.500> said<00:04:38.710> at<00:04:38.889> one<00:04:39.189> of<00:04:39.280> them<00:04:39.370> of

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
for me like i said at one of them of

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.499 
for me like i said at one of them of
course<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:39.909> liquid<00:04:40.000> x2<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:41.729> i<00:04:42.729> think<00:04:43.330> it's

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
course is the liquid x2 and i think it's

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.809 
course is the liquid x2 and i think it's
worth<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:44.560> would<00:04:45.430> certainly<00:04:45.580> be<00:04:45.759> something
