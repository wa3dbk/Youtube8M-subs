at<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.040> different<00:02:48.370> level<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.910> ramps<00:02:49.240> but<00:02:49.390> as

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
at a different level on the ramps but as

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.880 
at a different level on the ramps but as
you<00:02:49.600> look<00:02:49.810> across<00:02:49.990> here<00:02:50.470> it's<00:02:50.620> fairly

you look across here it's fairly

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.190 
you look across here it's fairly
balanced<00:02:51.430> it's<00:02:51.790> really<00:02:52.000> interesting<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:53.020> see

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
balanced it's really interesting to see

balanced it's really interesting to see
visually<00:02:53.560> from<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.860> outside<00:02:54.280> how<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.670> works

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
visually from the outside how that works

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.110 
visually from the outside how that works
as<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:56.920> sit<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.520> can't<00:02:57.730> even<00:02:57.819> tell

as we sit in here you can't even tell
how<00:02:58.300> uneven<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.840> surface

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
how uneven the surface
