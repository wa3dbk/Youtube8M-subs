00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.870
 good time 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.450
 the first is the harry potter and the stone 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.640
 philosopher I still did not know the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.070
 harry potter books so they can 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.859
 Administrator saw that I posted on the photo 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.039
 and this book from my library 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:46.100
 I had already watched a movie only 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.570
 read the book you understand better right to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.399
 harry potter's life 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.420
 It's very cool, this book and I'm super. 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.059
 I recommend and the second I'm reading is 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.229

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.899
 cool this here is mine and it's big 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:13.549
 events almost 400 pages 387 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.030
 but he is very cool and straightened in the middle 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.009
 of the book and I loved it it 's good but now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.560
 let's go to the point of interest that the 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:27.560
 book the stars then blame for 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:32.299

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.600
 marine and the title is so two clouds 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:40.250
 the blame is on the amboim stars and here 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.100
 Look, I do not know why these people are. 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.509
 but in all the books of john green and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.609
 also uses the landmarks here is this 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.859
 business 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.539
 and here it is written you will laugh cry 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.539
 and still want more 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.780
 Marcos uses author of the girl who stole 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.810
 books is also very cool the girl who 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 I stole books I just watch the movie I 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.039
 I'm still going to read the book and back in 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.459
 summary which is actually one of the phrases 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.800
 I tore that book girl and 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.990
 she falls in love with the august winged 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.950
 The rest I will not tell is for those who still 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.950
 did not read will surprise 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.960
 person then wrote one of the ethics 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.720
 radiofrequency phrases volleyball arrested 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130
 did dance graduated in math but I know 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.150
 of a thing there is an amount 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:43.250
 infinite number of numbers between zero and 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.110
 0.12 and 0.112 and a myriad of other 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.040
 obviously there is a set still 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.940
 higher between 10 and 12 or between 10 and 11 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.610
 millions 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.890
 some infinities are bigger than others 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.710
 there are many days when she gets angry 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.780
 with the size of my limited set and 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.640
 which is more numbers than probably 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.640
 I want to make the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.140
 good people at the end of the book are kind of weird 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.910
 who does not tell whether she dies or not 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.890
 But I do not think she runs and it's morning. 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.400

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.770
 writing is a myth we are not from 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.420
 It's true that it's the book's fault. 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.220
 left the game and breathed in the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.400

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.060
