the third of may and we will have six

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.029 
the third of may and we will have six
races<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.599> from<00:00:27.900> their<00:00:28.170> own<00:00:28.349> together

races going on from their own together
with<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> v8<00:00:29.970> GT<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.840> TDM<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.120> be

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
with a v8 GT and the TDM we can can be

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.560 
with a v8 GT and the TDM we can can be
reduced<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.750> two<00:00:33.960> points<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.180> design

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
reduced to two points what is the design

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.630 
reduced to two points what is the design
and<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> second<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> performance

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and the second one is the performance

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.479 
and the second one is the performance
you<00:00:38.910> change<00:00:39.629> everything<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.530> could<00:00:40.739> touch<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you change everything we could touch on

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
you change everything we could touch on
a<00:00:41.520> moose<00:00:41.760> Sierra<00:00:42.059> go<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.989> top<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
a moose Sierra go and on top of this we

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.760 
a moose Sierra go and on top of this we
said<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.520> wanted<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.210> very<00:00:45.539> exclusive<00:00:46.050> approach

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
said we wanted a very exclusive approach

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.209 
said we wanted a very exclusive approach
so<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.520> more<00:00:47.789> than<00:00:48.410> 350<00:00:49.410> cars<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:50.010> be

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so a lot more than 350 cars will be

00:00:50.219 --> 00:02:32.870 
so a lot more than 350 cars will be
produced

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
