00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.850
 Hello, youtube 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.340
 well here we go to ratify a 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.290
 very important subject in our 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.359
 power generator 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.519
 're powered gas is good to remember that the 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.910
 first video had said that this 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:25.210
 2.4 engine was what I was using 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.470
 Because of the cost benefit, it's 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 can generate 12 volts 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:39.010
 anecy alternator of 90 pÃ©rez roque 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.870
 90 ft alternator connected by belt 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:52.300
 on this engine ok the engine is good the gasoline 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.750
 2.4 mitsubishi and I found in this 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 system that a great difficulty in 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.600
 Good thing you want a generator up to 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.270
 more or less 750 watts 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.859
 this engine is ideal, it provides you with 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.880
 7 150 watts 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:15.609
 now if you want a higher power 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.219
 like a horse a horse and the two 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:21.329
 electric power force locks 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.759
 this motor that I do not advise you is 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:30.390
 because it is good to remember that in the first 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.390
 video I used this nobreak here Ã³ 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:44.409
 the break 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:47.889
 the pc here is not very good is the only 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 nobreak abc 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:56.380
 Ok this one I was using 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 well it marks here behind him like he had 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:11.540
 shown here 220 mark ok okay 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.600
 then what it marks 220 watch 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.740
 in this system that I was able to get out of it 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:27.200
 up to 600 650 wax it supported without 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:33.020
 switch off the engine with the alternator 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.660
 because when you pull electric power 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.750
 Are you pulling the battery? 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.820
 of the alternator which in turn pulls 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.720
 motor 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:50.600
 so I put it as a break from 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.260
 600 break 600 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.030
 the apc also ok 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:06.530
 including even mailing here for you 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:09.220
 they see it's connected here I think 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.220
 I was in league 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:21.620
 I then here in the case a break of 600 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.130
 see to who I voted here a fan 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.459
 to cool the transformer 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.989
 and keep a cooler in both transit 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.500
 output for cooling well it does not heat 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.299
 neither of the two senses and nokia 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.299
 I changed the thread that I threw a thread for 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:47.810
 very thick did not have thick wire with 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:51.880
 triumph and put two batteries of 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:58.239
 car interconnected to give 120 instead 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:03.140
 good personnel is the following that 600 hp a 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.930
 in this system I connected 1200 watts 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.540
 in him and he stood calmly 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.560
 The only problem I got was the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:19.950
 following engine 2.4 failed to 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.720
 keep it stopped even at high voltage 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:28.140
 When he stopped he was stopped by the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.080
 good right alternator 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:37.680
 the project works as long as you 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:40.020
 put here a motor z 7 hp sold 207 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.530
 thp sure will do to make 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:48.840
 system here for you generation of 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:54.140
 electricity or if you do not want to 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.240
 buy a motor an alternator 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.920
 you can do the following you can 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.990
 buy the electric power inverter 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.060
 of the power you want and couple 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 directly in your car 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.510
 in case of a blackout you start the engine 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.360
 your car and an extension for you 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.490
 calling in your house you will have the power 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.880
 you want because the car engine 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.190
 has a lot of strength 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.710
 Okay, so just to finalize that project. 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.920
 gas-fired power generator project that 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.130
 This motor here I got to work. 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.000
 place is in another video explaining the 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:42.270
 working places then is 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.360
 that one gets that warning if you want 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.100
 increase the power of your light 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.070
 you have to first switched the 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.700
 engine put a 7 hp motor 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.930
 Then you can generate media that a thousand 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.850
 and 500 kv to 2000 coffee out there so it goes 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.850
 Okay, it's okay, bye, bye, bye.
