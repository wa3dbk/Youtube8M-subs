properties<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.800> moisturizer<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.850> adds

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
properties in the moisturizer so it adds

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.650 
properties in the moisturizer so it adds
attention<00:02:37.780> here<00:02:38.340> without<00:02:39.340> being<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.940> too

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
attention here without being like too

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.770 
attention here without being like too
much<00:02:40.810> attention<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.820> first<00:02:43.240> I'm<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.660> put

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
much attention so first I'm going to put

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.450 
much attention so first I'm going to put
on<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.960> moisturizer<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.920> part<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.250> optional

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
on the moisturizer this part is optional

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.370 
on the moisturizer this part is optional
but<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.150> think<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.480> adds<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.020> overall

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
but I just think it adds to the overall

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.800 
but I just think it adds to the overall
look<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.890> obviously<00:02:48.850> I'll<00:02:49.060> cut<00:02:49.330> away<00:02:49.570> and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
look and obviously I'll cut away and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.660 
look and obviously I'll cut away and
come<00:02:50.080> back<00:02:50.110> because<00:02:50.860> I'm<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.190> going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.460> show

it look like there's more depth so then

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.340 
it look like there's more depth so then
it<00:03:36.400> makes<00:03:36.640> them<00:03:36.850> look<00:03:37.000> bigger<00:03:37.209> it's<00:03:37.870> basically

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
it makes them look bigger it's basically

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.710 
it makes them look bigger it's basically
the<00:03:38.590> same<00:03:38.830> principles<00:03:39.430> as<00:03:39.580> quad<00:03:39.940> contouring

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the same principles as quad contouring

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.630 
the same principles as quad contouring
your<00:03:40.840> face<00:03:40.900> or<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.709> put<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.980> underneath<00:03:42.340> your

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
your face or you put it underneath your

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.220 
your face or you put it underneath your
cheekbones<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:43.480> then<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.720> looks<00:03:43.900> like<00:03:44.080> your

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
cheekbones so then it looks like your

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.230 
cheekbones so then it looks like your
cheekbones<00:03:44.590> are<00:03:44.770> higher<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.910> I'm<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.090> going

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
cheekbones are higher so I'm just going

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.290 
cheekbones are higher so I'm just going
to<00:03:46.270> take<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> little<00:03:46.840> bit<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:48.150> rub<00:03:49.150> it

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
to take a little bit of this and rub it

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.590 
to take a little bit of this and rub it
in<00:03:49.480> here<00:03:50.140> obviously<00:03:50.800> I'm<00:03:51.340> not<00:03:51.610> going<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.270> zoom

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
in here obviously I'm not going to zoom

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.130 
in here obviously I'm not going to zoom
in<00:03:52.840> because<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.709> would<00:03:53.920> be<00:03:54.100> kind<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.550> awkward

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
in because that would be kind of awkward

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.380 
in because that would be kind of awkward
so<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.530> kind<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.400> see<00:03:57.610> what's<00:03:57.820> going<00:03:57.910> on

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
so you can kind of see what's going on

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.250 
so you can kind of see what's going on
here<00:03:58.800> just<00:03:59.800> put<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.130> in<00:04:00.310> between<00:04:00.990> wiggle<00:04:01.990> it<00:04:02.110> up

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
here just put it in between wiggle it up

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.220 
here just put it in between wiggle it up
and<00:04:02.709> then<00:04:03.310> blend<00:04:03.820> I'm<00:04:04.420> going<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.660> put<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> little

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
and then blend I'm going to put a little

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.680 
and then blend I'm going to put a little
bit<00:04:05.410> more<00:04:05.650> on<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:06.040> side<00:04:06.250> then<00:04:07.209> on<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.540> other

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
bit more on this side then on the other

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.110 
bit more on this side then on the other
because<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.140> have<00:04:08.640> because<00:04:09.640> they're<00:04:09.820> just<00:04:09.970> not

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
because I have because they're just not

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.220 
because I have because they're just not
even<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:11.820> put<00:04:12.820> a<00:04:12.850> little<00:04:13.000> bit<00:04:13.510> more<00:04:13.570> on<00:04:14.050> this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
even so put a little bit more on this

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.380 
even so put a little bit more on this
side<00:04:16.950> I'm<00:04:17.950> going<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.190> wipe<00:04:18.430> off<00:04:18.609> my<00:04:18.669> brush<00:04:19.180> a

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
side I'm going to wipe off my brush a

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.210 
side I'm going to wipe off my brush a
little<00:04:19.510> so<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.870> has<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.080> little<00:04:20.290> less<00:04:20.560> product

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
little so it has a little less product

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.300 
little so it has a little less product
and<00:04:21.340> blend<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.970> in<00:04:22.470> basically<00:04:23.470> just<00:04:23.770> wrap<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.040> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and blend it in basically just wrap it a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.190 
and blend it in basically just wrap it a
bunch<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.640> times<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.240> I've<00:04:25.480> blended<00:04:25.690> that<00:04:25.990> in<00:04:26.110> a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
bunch of times so I've blended that in a

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.710 
bunch of times so I've blended that in a
little<00:04:26.380> better<00:04:26.940> I'm<00:04:27.940> not<00:04:28.210> sure<00:04:28.420> if<00:04:28.570> the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
little better I'm not sure if the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.810 
little better I'm not sure if the
lighting<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.230> going<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.500> pick<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:29.890> up<00:04:30.040> but<00:04:30.670> you

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
lighting is going to pick it up but you

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.940 
lighting is going to pick it up but you
can<00:04:31.000> kind<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.390> already<00:04:31.660> see<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:32.140> it<00:04:32.440> makes<00:04:32.770> it

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
can kind of already see that it makes it

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.400 
can kind of already see that it makes it
look<00:04:33.220> like<00:04:33.520> I'm<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.390> little<00:04:34.750> fuller<00:04:35.050> than<00:04:35.260> I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
look like I'm a little fuller than I

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.070 
look like I'm a little fuller than I
actually<00:04:35.530> am<00:04:36.010> so<00:04:36.820> now<00:04:37.000> next<00:04:37.360> I'm<00:04:37.690> going<00:04:37.960> to

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
actually am so now next I'm going to

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.220 
actually am so now next I'm going to
take<00:04:38.410> my<00:04:39.340> pigment<00:04:40.060> here<00:04:40.480> I'm<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.020> take<00:04:41.200> a

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
take my pigment here I'm going to take a

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.340 
take my pigment here I'm going to take a
little<00:04:41.620> bit<00:04:41.770> onto<00:04:42.040> my<00:04:42.220> hand<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.780> then<00:04:43.960> dust<00:04:44.200> it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
little bit onto my hand and then dust it

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.610 
little bit onto my hand and then dust it
onto<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.770> same<00:04:45.250> brush<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:47.230> I'm<00:04:47.350> going<00:04:47.530> to

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
onto that same brush and I'm going to

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.860 
onto that same brush and I'm going to
put<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.830> on<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.190> top<00:04:48.490> here<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.240> that's<00:04:49.780> just

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
put it on the top here and that's just

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.660 
put it on the top here and that's just
going<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.230> create<00:04:50.860> kind<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.370> illusion

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
going to create kind of the illusion

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.330 
going to create kind of the illusion
that<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.480> coming<00:04:52.870> more<00:04:53.050> forward<00:04:53.590> it's<00:04:54.070> kind

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
that it's coming more forward it's kind

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.160 
that it's coming more forward it's kind
of<00:04:54.430> Lego<00:04:54.700> principles<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.360> photography<00:04:55.510> kind

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
of Lego principles of photography kind

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.990 
of Lego principles of photography kind
of<00:04:56.290> thing<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.920> darker<00:04:57.370> something<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.850> the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
of thing the darker something is the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.640 
of thing the darker something is the
more<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.300> recedes<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.260> bite<00:04:59.470> or

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
more it recedes and the bite or

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.800 
more it recedes and the bite or
something<00:04:59.800> is<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.190> more<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.550> sentence<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.720> I'm

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
something is the more a sentence so I'm

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
something is the more a sentence so I'm
just<00:05:01.960> going<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.170> put<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.700> on<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.960> top<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.560> my

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
just going to put this on the top of my

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.690 
just going to put this on the top of my
chest<00:05:06.040> area<00:05:06.610> here<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:11.070> there<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:12.190> go<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.550> kind

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
chest area here and there you go it kind

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.270 
chest area here and there you go it kind
of<00:05:12.850> brings<00:05:13.090> with<00:05:13.330> my<00:05:13.870> chest<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.920> little<00:05:14.950> bit

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
of brings with my chest a little bit

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.580 
of brings with my chest a little bit
forward<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.150> hope<00:05:16.390> that<00:05:16.630> gave<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.080> guys<00:05:17.260> a

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
forward so I hope that gave you guys a

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.070 
forward so I hope that gave you guys a
good<00:05:17.920> idea<00:05:18.280> on<00:05:18.370> like<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.480> principles<00:05:19.900> of

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
good idea on like the principles of

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.200 
good idea on like the principles of
contouring<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.220> how<00:05:21.370> they<00:05:21.520> can<00:05:21.700> work<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:22.060> your

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
contouring and how they can work to your

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.560 
contouring and how they can work to your
advantage<00:05:22.710> so<00:05:23.710> this<00:05:23.890> kind<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.250> created<00:05:24.760> like

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
advantage so this kind of created like

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.110 
advantage so this kind of created like
almost<00:05:26.140> like<00:05:26.290> half<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.800> cup<00:05:27.040> size<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.820> me

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
almost like half a cup size to me

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.330 
almost like half a cup size to me
because<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.930> am<00:05:28.990> really<00:05:29.290> small<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.980> kind<00:05:30.280> of

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
because I am really small that kind of
