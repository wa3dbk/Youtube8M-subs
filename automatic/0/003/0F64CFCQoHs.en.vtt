00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.940
 has more than four sensors and four 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.650
 sensors back and two sensors forward 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 but you imagine I want to know what 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.860
 Of course I had borrowed of course

 new kia cerato 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.900
 is a purely 100% Korean brand that

 from here 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.049
 motors currently x has had a 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.509
 resurgence has launched models 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.369
 totally different from the mood and 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.320
 enthusiasm of the Peruvian people is the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.570
 type of vehicle designs that are very 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 aggressive and the engines that are very but 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.780
 very cheap because it is one of the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.700
 few brands that are five years old or 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.409
 100,000 kilometers of warranty that there will be 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.380
 together when for the reporter by

 cerato saying that having a vehicle 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.130
 of six changes you will have a better 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.909
 Fuel efficiency 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.100
 regardless of the word this 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.020
 drop type that has chromed let's say it's 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.640
 of six changes plus one of recoil 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.860
 This vehicle has a very detailed 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.399
 important that is the central panning of the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.929
 vehicle has two side windows in 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.880
 the back which makes you a 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.739
 much wider vehicle vision of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.170
 lost or what we call the angle 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.580
 dead of the vehicle the panorama of 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.610
 vehicle that makes it look much more 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.370
 lighter board and in the part already of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.370
 board you have 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.069
 with a selector for the illumination of the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.790
 Board another selector for parking 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.159
 has a rudder lined with leather and goods 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.799
 additional you have here what is the 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.720
 radio command at the helm what this 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.420
 vehicle is innovating in its series in 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.810
 its category doing 1600 speed 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.510
 additional cruise that brings the humphrey and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.220
 gross and also street attracts him that is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.319
 the command of the mini computer for 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.209
 Tell you how many kilometers 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.440
 has a journey and what is the autonomy 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.440
 of travel you have for this vehicle 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.480
 It has a very aggressive design and very 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.520
 sporting first thing that everything comes 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.820
 with a key which allows you with a 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.560
 automatic control you can open the 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.000
 centralized locking to vehicles what 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.250

 logo mark here in the part 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.990
 central which identifies it a lot 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.810
 then we are talking about lighthouses 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.700
 halogens which come with their 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.410
 respective led we had talked and 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.780
 I had commented to my friend in the claudia 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.940
 that had special sensors 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.880
 games so that they do not collide when 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.470
 they are parking now there are no excuses 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.140
 exact and this vehicle has two 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.450
 front and four match sensors 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.110
 rear party sensors has a 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.280
 Very aggressive line very aesthetic then 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.600
 you have the one in the mirror which is a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.420
 security issue nowadays 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.730
 forward is reflected in it 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.070
 Windshield design comes with a 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.630
 sensor which allows you to have a tasting 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.180
 action on the audio of the frequencies 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.550
 for the radio that already has a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.710
 particularity the Japanese a super plug 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.660
 Lightweight motor is a 1600 motor 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.810
 cubic centimeters four cylinders 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.220
 double camshaft with 16 valves is 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.800
 find us we have counted yesterday

 We are an authorized dealer and have 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.530
 cheap spare parts you told me that always 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.020
 They come to visit you so they can not go up 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.090
 to the car to scale those that we are 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.100
 doing which allows you to 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.670
 rear seats are folding 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:52.470

 this clothes if everything is calm 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.529
 I still imagine that going to the beach with 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.259
 my cart 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:12.319
 if you calm a style you are taking 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.259
 a super super economic vehicle 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.279
 spacious super sports because that's 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.849
 very important 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:23.089
 after you give an area a design 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:26.259
 sports then let's see let's 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.259
 try this cart 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.440
 rodri that so much has appeared the new 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.229
 Pleasant day I thought it was very good 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.990

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.240
 good with a lot of family is terrible but 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.220
 the car is spectacular as you know 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.220
 piurano like pepsi a lot but 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.699
 the question is that you already know that 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.320
 to do everyone well is a new car that 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.150
 comes to our city and they have to 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.860
 buy them all but so missing 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.090
 clothes the little piggy clear break 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.889
 chanchito saca is simple because 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.020
 It is also a car for all show 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.240
 expensive and comes full and also asks normal 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.860
 so it is so that tyrants no longer know 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.960
 break the piglet and we are going to 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.960
