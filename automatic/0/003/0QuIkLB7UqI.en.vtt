one of the largest helmets I've ever
seen<00:03:53.460> I<00:03:54.060> think<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.840> Hutchison

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820

Hutchinson his helmet number 76 yeah I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.320 
Hutchinson his helmet number 76 yeah I
mean<00:04:01.440> look<00:04:02.040> into<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.310> marks<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:05.330> it

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
mean look into the marks on that it

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.580 
mean look into the marks on that it
looks<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.720> also<00:04:06.870> painted<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.470> little

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
looks like they also painted a little

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.900 
looks like they also painted a little
bit<00:04:07.800> like<00:04:07.980> some<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.340> some<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.670> marks

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
bit like some of the some of the marks

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.460 
bit like some of the some of the marks
earlier<00:04:09.210> in<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.360> season<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.810> might<00:04:10.050> might

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
earlier in the season so I might might

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.600 
earlier in the season so I might might
have<00:04:10.590> worn<00:04:10.740> this<00:04:10.890> for<00:04:11.040> multiple<00:04:11.370> games

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
have worn this for multiple games

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.570 
have worn this for multiple games
certainly<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:13.620> would<00:04:13.890> think<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.130> lot<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.340> them

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
certainly I would think a lot of them

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.500 
certainly I would think a lot of them
from<00:04:15.150> my<00:04:15.300> knowledge<00:04:15.510> where

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
from my knowledge where

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.730 
from my knowledge where
multiple<00:04:16.960> games<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:18.450> lot<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.600> repair<00:04:19.900> work<00:04:19.930> they
