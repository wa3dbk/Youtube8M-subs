tune like regular tech deck trucks with
the<00:03:38.569> yellow<00:03:38.750> tuning<00:03:39.230> there's<00:03:40.040> no<00:03:40.790> pivot<00:03:41.180> cups

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
the yellow tuning there's no pivot cups

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:47.610 
the yellow tuning there's no pivot cups
and<00:03:43.930> they<00:03:44.930> have<00:03:45.079> a<00:03:45.109> wide<00:03:45.410> variety<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:46.010> colors<00:03:46.510> I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
and they have a wide variety of colors I

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.470 
and they have a wide variety of colors I
chose<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.370> green<00:03:49.670> ones<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.090> go<00:03:50.239> with<00:03:50.389> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
chose the green ones to go with the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.610 
chose the green ones to go with the
yellow<00:03:50.690> duck<00:03:50.959> because<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.200> think<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.470> looked

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
yellow duck because I think it looked

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.020 
yellow duck because I think it looked
really<00:03:51.769> gnarly<00:03:52.220> considering<00:03:52.639> that<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.880> had

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
really gnarly considering that it had

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.509 
really gnarly considering that it had
the<00:03:53.269> yellow<00:03:54.109> bushings<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.680> there<00:03:54.859> as<00:03:55.190> well<00:03:55.489> so

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
the yellow bushings in there as well so

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.280 
the yellow bushings in there as well so
it's<00:03:55.790> got<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> yellow<00:03:56.209> wheels<00:03:56.480> green<00:03:57.049> and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
it's got the yellow wheels green and

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.110 
it's got the yellow wheels green and
yellow<00:03:57.470> bushings<00:03:57.889> in<00:03:57.980> yellow<00:03:58.160> deck<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.609> really

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
small deck very much this one was my

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.150 
small deck very much this one was my
actual<00:05:10.700> preference<00:05:11.270> out<00:05:11.420> of<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.630> to<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.860> pop

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
actual preference out of the to the pop

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.100 
actual preference out of the to the pop
was<00:05:13.430> very<00:05:13.730> nice<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.360> only<00:05:14.630> thing<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:15.080> that

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
was very nice the only thing is that

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.560 
was very nice the only thing is that
when<00:05:15.980> i<00:05:16.010> first<00:05:16.340> started<00:05:16.640> using<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.090> deck<00:05:17.300> I

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
when i first started using the deck I

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.410 
when i first started using the deck I
thought<00:05:18.230> um<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:19.250> thought<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:20.030> reason<00:05:20.180> why<00:05:20.390> I

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
thought um I thought the reason why I

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.820 
thought um I thought the reason why I
was<00:05:20.570> having<00:05:20.840> trouble<00:05:21.140> getting<00:05:21.230> used<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.710> it

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
was having trouble getting used to it

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.470 
was having trouble getting used to it
was<00:05:21.980> because<00:05:22.310> of<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.580> actual<00:05:22.940> board<00:05:23.180> itself

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
was because of the actual board itself

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.420 
was because of the actual board itself
but<00:05:24.170> it<00:05:24.290> turns<00:05:24.500> out<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.980> was<00:05:25.100> because<00:05:25.400> of

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
but it turns out that it was because of

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.490 
but it turns out that it was because of
the<00:05:25.610> grip<00:05:25.850> tape<00:05:26.060> all<00:05:26.570> I<00:05:26.630> had<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.960> do<00:05:27.170> was<00:05:27.350> just
