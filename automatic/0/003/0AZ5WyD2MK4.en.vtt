different about that video I swear I do

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.880 
different about that video I swear I do
this<00:02:09.360> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> time<00:02:09.629> I'd<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> review

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
this all the time I'd make a review

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250 
this all the time I'd make a review
video<00:02:11.039> keep<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> project<00:02:12.239> file<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.050> can

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
video keep the project file so you can

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
video keep the project file so you can
actually<00:02:13.410> go

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
actually go

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
actually go
can<00:02:14.010> change<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.300> might<00:02:15.420> notice<00:02:15.570> like

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
can change it and you might notice like

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.420 
can change it and you might notice like
an<00:02:15.930> awkward<00:02:16.110> pause<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.740> audio<00:02:17.070> or<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
an awkward pause in the audio or you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.010 
an awkward pause in the audio or you
might<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.820> wanted<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.360> say<00:02:18.630> something

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
might have wanted to say something

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.930 
might have wanted to say something
differently<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.070> go<00:02:20.340> back<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.790> actually

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
differently you can go back and actually

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300 
differently you can go back and actually
do<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.350> you've<00:02:22.710> had<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> video

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
do that so it's like you've had a video

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.980 
do that so it's like you've had a video
up<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> go<00:02:24.270> back<00:02:24.450> take<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.720> down

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
up and you want to go back take it down

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.780 
up and you want to go back take it down
and<00:02:25.110> change<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.400> would<00:02:26.580> say<00:02:26.730> so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and change it that's what I would say so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.150 
and change it that's what I would say so
actually<00:02:27.330> sleep<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.680> let<00:02:28.890> me<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:28.980> if

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
actually sleep on it and let me know if

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.590 
actually sleep on it and let me know if
you<00:02:29.220> try<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.520> because<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> actually<00:02:30.060> worked

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
you try this because it actually worked

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.110 
you try this because it actually worked
for<00:02:30.840> me<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.320> found<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.950> lot<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.460> my<00:02:32.550> videos<00:02:32.640> change

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
for me I found a lot of my videos change

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.240 
for me I found a lot of my videos change
a<00:02:33.270> lot<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.690> from<00:02:33.810> doing<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.290> having<00:02:35.070> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
a lot just from doing this having a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.160 
a lot just from doing this having a
video<00:02:35.400> concept<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.180> your<00:02:36.300> head<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.660> making<00:02:36.960> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
video concept in your head and making it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.440 
video concept in your head and making it
a<00:02:37.230> reality<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:38.460> really<00:02:38.700> evolve<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.120> lot<00:02:39.270> when

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
a reality can really evolve a lot when

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
a reality can really evolve a lot when
you<00:02:39.480> sleep<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.320> overall<00:02:40.590> I'd<00:02:40.830> say<00:02:40.860> when

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
