00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.220
 hello everyone this is my first video of 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.380
 I'm not the author of this legend 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.359
 I think that legend would fit more than 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.669
 creepy pasta I've researched it thoroughly 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.050
 on various websites and I think this 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.970
 version has been the one that has most 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 convinced about the famous painting of 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.430
 anis resist me also known as the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.500
 haunted painting of ebay is a painting 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.850
 created by the American painter and 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.370
 stoneham in 1972 represents a young 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.409
 next to a doll standing in front of a 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.989
 door with glass panels against 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.850
 that many hands are pressed according to 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.100
 artist the child is based on a 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.140
 photograph of himself for five years and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.089
 it is interpreted as the door is a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.129
 representation of the dividing line 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.170
 between the waking world and the world of 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.119
 the dreams and possibilities and the doll 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.670
 is a guide that accompanies the child to 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.650
 through it the hands represent 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.530
 the different life possibilities of the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.350

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.659
