00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
 1 

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 all 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.860
 linky has been drawn in several 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.260
 different styles 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.550
 during the different games zelda here 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.260
 we will see the version we have 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.510
 started to see from wind waker 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.880
 also called cs link 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.380
 its design is close to chibi design 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.780
 that is with proportions 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.970
 special after making a line 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.140
 vertical divided into three the first 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.539
 part is time for the head 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.190
 the second of the blow to the waist and the 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.500
 third of the waist to the legs 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.160
 we will start by sketching 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 his position 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.700
 here he stands right with the hand 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.810
 right leaning on his hip and hand 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.810
 left holding his sword 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 then we must delimit this unique 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.670
 is also placed the battery belt on the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.440
 third horizontal line the head and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 the most difficult part in particular 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.750
 the eyes here we start with 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 delimit the hair we imagine that the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
 wind comes from the right to the left 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.580
 so his hair and hat will be 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.580
 directed in this direction 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:58.150
 place the hat like this finally we 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.070
 let's get to the eyes as it's a style 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.080
 chibi the eyes are very big by 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 relationship to the face they are the ones who will 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.520
 be used for expressions 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.550
 add eyebrows above the eyes 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.910
 and your character is ready to be 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.910
 rooted 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.980
 However, the anchoring that is determined 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.840
 the contrasts this style of link called 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.819
 that chenni does that traits are not 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.180
 not the same thickness so a 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.250
 little random it's a difficult style to 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.150
 control 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.049
 but you do not have to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.430
 respect to the letter 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.760
 you can simply create them 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760
 contours 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.489
 to finalize the drawing we him 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.970
 drawing his shield that tied him 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.970
 on the back 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.810
 for the shadows we determined that 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.350
 the light source was up at 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.330
 left 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.020
 so the waves will be under the hat 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.740
 hair the neck a little bit of the tunic 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.740
 etc. 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:13.430
 we use yellow for the hair 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:16.090
 took a very yellow yellow him pink 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.090
 for the face 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.710
 ears and hands 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.920
 then a clear glass for the sleeves 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.819
 then brown for the boots of the 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.249
 yellow for the belt if possible a 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.409
 little younger than for the hair and 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.710
 a darker green for the tunic and the 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.710
 hat 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.460
 to make the contrasts with the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.730
 colors we start with the pants 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.650
 which is white hills 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.270
 so we use double the sauce 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.860
 bright being on the top left 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.480
 the undd will be on this side like this for 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.460
 the boots use a brown a little 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.680
 darker or then supported stronger 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.790
 on the pencil does the same thing for the 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.790
 tunic and hat 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.539
 for the hair we use 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.539
 orange and a pale yellow 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.220
 then werther him for the sleeves 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.550
 and you finished your link drawing
