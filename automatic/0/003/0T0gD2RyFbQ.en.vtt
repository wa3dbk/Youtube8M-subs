00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.900
 and then guys okay 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.350
 today here on the channel bring another video 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.230
 for you and I had already spoken in another 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.540
 video that is how the volume increased one 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.360
 tutorial as input the volume of the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.490
 Microphone, that's retro phone. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.890
 it picks up your voice only if you 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.520
 I want to see you let him catch it 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.899
 higher for example you just so 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.030
 civility 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.579
 I'll show you how it works. 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.739
 any hymn is the one here 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.940
 control panel here but it is very 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.290
 you go from your dashboard to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.980
 control depending on windows for vai 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.370
 hardware and sounds 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.559
 the new one just in the new recording is looks 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.120
 than the volume 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.210
 I'll show you the difference. 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.759
 here's the real one when I'm talking about it 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.600
 approaches up here 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:11.770
 Now I go and it 's you I'll be able to you 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.950
 either with the right properties 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:21.429
 go levels and decrease here I will decrease 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.719
 here quickly it's ready look the difference 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.149
 trying to speak much louder than 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.020
 normal because look she does not stay two 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.020
 nor when in 3 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.070
 ready the difference now is not to talk 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.070
 too much because if you do not hear anything 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.009
 this gives a little more noise and sports 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.590
 he is picking up eight more goals but has been 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 more sensitive to the microphone 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.899
 then the voice gets louder 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.840
 the noise is a bit higher if it is not too much 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.450
 thing if you put the next song 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.340
 el have here I just favor a 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.110
 gameplay of a game there was still a lot 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.580
 but this will improve a lot 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.129
 there are some apps you can 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.730
 change with one's own education is the 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.640
 microphone to leave louder or not 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 this one is for the general is sow by 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.790
 example is skype is already much higher 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.590
 I did not notice it's because my voice she 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.650
 low the personnel that in the program took the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.340
 lower door 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.099
 already mad is I hope you enjoyed the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.520
 video was very fast only gave 2 million 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.070
 it occurs that in fact even more 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.260
 well I get there is bound to watch 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.260
