00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
wouldn't trigger the next checkpoint but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
wouldn't trigger the next checkpoint but
I<00:02:07.229> happened<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> kill<00:02:08.039> enough<00:02:08.429> enemies<00:02:08.610> with

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
I happened to kill enough enemies with

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.999 
I happened to kill enough enemies with
the<00:02:09.360> rocket<00:02:09.660> launcher<00:02:09.929> shot<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.709> while<00:02:10.979> I

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the rocket launcher shot that while I

was going you know three to one to
respawn<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.560> did

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.979 
respawn it did
set<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> next<00:02:14.610> checkpoint<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.180> once<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.720> sets

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
set the next checkpoint and once it sets

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.660 
set the next checkpoint and once it sets
the<00:02:16.140> next<00:02:16.379> checkpoint<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.310> won't<00:02:17.519> have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the next checkpoint you won't have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610 
the next checkpoint you won't have
enemies<00:02:18.030> rushing<00:02:18.420> out<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.659> door<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
enemies rushing out of the door and the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.320 
enemies rushing out of the door and the
farming<00:02:20.069> technique<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.549> kind<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.849> ruined<00:02:21.180> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
farming technique is kind of ruined so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.699 
farming technique is kind of ruined so
you<00:02:21.390> definitely<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.930> want<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> kill<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> bunch

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
you definitely just want to kill a bunch

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.800 
you definitely just want to kill a bunch
of<00:02:22.890> enemies<00:02:23.099> but<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.269> let<00:02:24.450> yourself

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
of enemies but then just let yourself

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.399 
of enemies but then just let yourself
get<00:02:25.019> overwhelmed<00:02:25.700> now<00:02:26.700> again<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.180> got<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.750> crap

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
gonna be a link in the description of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.250 
gonna be a link in the description of
this<00:02:37.769> video<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.819> video<00:02:39.299> but<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.019> seems

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this video for that video but it seems

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.190 
this video for that video but it seems
like<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.099> definitely<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.420> best<00:02:42.780> farming

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
like this is definitely the best farming

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.170 
like this is definitely the best farming
spot<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.709> game<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.730> far<00:02:45.030> especially

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
spot in the game so far especially

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.360 
spot in the game so far especially
because<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.049> do<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.290> solo<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.190> other

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
because you can do it solo the other

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.490 
because you can do it solo the other
probably<00:02:47.879> one<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> best<00:02:48.360> ones<00:02:48.629> was<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
probably one of the best ones was the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.619 
probably one of the best ones was the
one<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:50.370> Venus<00:02:50.819> where<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.209> Nexus

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
one on Venus where you do the Nexus

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.479 
one on Venus where you do the Nexus
strike<00:02:51.989> mission<00:02:52.379> but<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.829> have<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.459> a

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
strike mission but you have to have a

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.830 
strike mission but you have to have a
party<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.000> three<00:02:54.269> because<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.599> strike

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
party of three because the strike

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.809 
party of three because the strike
mission<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.160> don't<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.730> have

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
mission with this you don't have to have

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.130 
mission with this you don't have to have
anyone<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.329> just<00:02:57.629> do<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.930> by<00:02:57.989> yourself

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
anyone you can just do this by yourself

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.319 
anyone you can just do this by yourself
and<00:02:58.650> again<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.280> was<00:02:59.370> extremely<00:02:59.760> effective<00:02:59.970> I

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
and again it was extremely effective I

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.099 
and again it was extremely effective I
got<00:03:00.540> probably<00:03:01.170> around<00:03:01.530> 15<00:03:02.420> blue<00:03:03.420> engrams<00:03:03.629> and

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
got probably around 15 blue engrams and

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.770 
got probably around 15 blue engrams and
one<00:03:04.769> purple<00:03:05.220> Engram<00:03:05.579> in<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.209> space<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.690> about

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
one purple Engram in the space of about

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.869 
one purple Engram in the space of about
half<00:03:07.140> an<00:03:07.260> hour<00:03:07.379> which<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:07.950> excellent

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
half an hour which is excellent

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.539 
half an hour which is excellent
considering<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> harder<00:03:10.049> strikes<00:03:10.379> will<00:03:11.220> take

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
considering the harder strikes will take

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.830 
considering the harder strikes will take
you<00:03:11.849> about<00:03:12.299> 45<00:03:13.140> minutes<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:14.129> an<00:03:14.160> hour<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:15.629> I

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
you about 45 minutes to an hour so I

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.150 
you about 45 minutes to an hour so I
