because the way they are designed you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810 
because the way they are designed you
look<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.500> think<00:02:58.739> wow<00:02:58.950> how<00:02:59.400> will

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
look at this and you think wow how will

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.850 
look at this and you think wow how will
that<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.600> doesn't<00:03:00.780> make<00:03:01.140> much<00:03:01.410> sense<00:03:01.470> it

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
that that doesn't make much sense it

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
that that doesn't make much sense it
looks<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.370> kind<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.550> randomly

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
looks like they just kind of randomly

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.940 
looks like they just kind of randomly
put<00:03:03.150> pads<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.600> really<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.500> thought

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
put pads but really they really thought

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
put pads but really they really thought
this<00:03:05.130> out<00:03:05.250> very<00:03:05.550> well<00:03:05.730> because<00:03:06.030> holding<00:03:06.540> your

about any cotton mechanics gloves

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.949 
about any cotton mechanics gloves
mechanics<00:04:13.380> made<00:04:13.530> gloves<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.010> velcro<00:04:14.190> insist

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
mechanics made gloves the velcro insist

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.810 
mechanics made gloves the velcro insist
now<00:04:15.959> with<00:04:16.140> normal<00:04:16.530> velcro<00:04:16.950> normal

of the velcro for lack of a better word

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.779 
of the velcro for lack of a better word
has<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> tendency<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.900> long<00:04:25.620> use<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.580> kind<00:04:26.760> of

has a tendency to long use to kind of

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.150 
has a tendency to long use to kind of
get<00:04:26.910> compacted<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.810> when<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.650> gets<00:04:28.770> compacted

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
get compacted and when it gets compacted

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.130 
get compacted and when it gets compacted
like<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.700> or<00:04:29.910> gets<00:04:30.090> all<00:04:30.240> messed<00:04:30.450> up<00:04:30.630> or<00:04:30.930> even

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
like that or gets all messed up or even

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.830 
like that or gets all messed up or even
the<00:04:31.380> teeth<00:04:31.710> bar<00:04:31.950> kind<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.550> too<00:04:32.729> now<00:04:33.660> it

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
the teeth bar kind of do this too now it

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.640 
the teeth bar kind of do this too now it
loses<00:04:34.140> into<00:04:34.380> fish

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
loses into fish

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.890 
loses into fish
see<00:04:34.889> it<00:04:35.280> won't<00:04:35.520> bind<00:04:35.790> as<00:04:36.000> well<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.750> know<00:04:36.840> it

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
see it won't bind as well you know it

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.780 
see it won't bind as well you know it
won't<00:04:37.080> stick<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.440> each<00:04:37.530> other<00:04:37.680> as<00:04:37.860> well<00:04:38.130> let's

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
won't stick to each other as well let's

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.950 
won't stick to each other as well let's
still<00:04:38.940> stick<00:04:39.150> together<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.690> kind<00:04:39.870> of

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
still stick together but it's kind of

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.860 
still stick together but it's kind of
it's<00:04:40.560> slowly<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.070> gets<00:04:41.250> more<00:04:41.610> degraded<00:04:42.090> with

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
it's slowly and gets more degraded with

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.439 
it's slowly and gets more degraded with
these<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.380> velcro<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.860> more<00:04:44.070> fine<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.789> more

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
these the velcro is more fine and more

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.550 
these the velcro is more fine and more
more<00:04:48.449> fun<00:04:48.690> that's<00:04:48.960> really<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.229> only<00:04:49.259> word<00:04:49.500> I

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
more fun that's really the only word I

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.600 
more fun that's really the only word I
can<00:04:49.650> think<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.949> describe<00:04:50.009> it<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.430> don't

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
can think of to describe it I don't

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.430 
can think of to describe it I don't
really<00:04:50.729> know<00:04:51.539> how<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.780> describe<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.259> velcro

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
really know how to describe the velcro

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.590 
really know how to describe the velcro
on<00:04:52.650> this<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:53.250> more<00:04:53.400> fine<00:04:53.639> more<00:04:53.970> small<00:04:54.300> it

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
on this it's more fine more small it

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.050 
on this it's more fine more small it
won't<00:04:55.050> compact<00:04:55.500> any<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.430> feels<00:04:56.699> kind<00:04:56.820> of

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
won't compact any it feels kind of

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.510 
won't compact any it feels kind of
smoother<00:04:57.509> but<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.680> still<00:04:58.979> binds<00:04:59.280> together

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
smoother but it still binds together

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.879 
smoother but it still binds together
very<00:05:00.090> very<00:05:00.240> well<00:05:00.750> these<00:05:01.169> are<00:05:01.350> not<00:05:01.590> going<00:05:01.800> to

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
very very well these are not going to

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.460 
very very well these are not going to
come<00:05:02.009> undone<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.520> they're<00:05:03.210> very<00:05:03.830> cool<00:05:04.830> velcro

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
come undone and they're very cool velcro

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.710 
come undone and they're very cool velcro
straps<00:05:07.639> they<00:05:08.639> fit<00:05:08.820> really<00:05:08.970> well<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.270> got<00:05:09.449> small

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
straps they fit really well I got small

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.930 
straps they fit really well I got small
I<00:05:10.020> got<00:05:10.590> him<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.770> small<00:05:11.010> because<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.400> have<00:05:11.490> small

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
I got him in small because I have small

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.200 
I got him in small because I have small
hands<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.710> they<00:05:13.710> fit<00:05:13.919> very<00:05:13.949> very<00:05:14.610> well<00:05:14.850> better

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
hands and they fit very very well better

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.920 
hands and they fit very very well better
than<00:05:15.389> any<00:05:15.570> glove<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.870> ever<00:05:16.020> tried<00:05:16.199> on<00:05:16.320> before

thing to take out this glove it would be

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.350 
thing to take out this glove it would be
this<00:05:22.800> little<00:05:22.979> tag<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.639> kind<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.910> just<00:05:24.090> sticks

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
this little tag it kind of just sticks

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.150 
this little tag it kind of just sticks
out<00:05:24.510> obnoxiously<00:05:25.080> but<00:05:25.380> that's<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:25.949> me<00:05:26.070> being
