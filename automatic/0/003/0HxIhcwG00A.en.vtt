00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
righty is now going to be facing the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
righty is now going to be facing the
fence<00:00:29.340> over<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.420> you've<00:00:30.539> made<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> move

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
fence over here so you've made that move

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.260 
fence over here so you've made that move
you're<00:00:31.500> moving<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:31.980> feet<00:00:32.219> while<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.149> were

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
you're moving your feet while you were

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.709 
you're moving your feet while you were
turned<00:00:33.690> very<00:00:34.680> critical<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.790> move<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.300> feet<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
turned very critical to move your feet a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
turned very critical to move your feet a
lot<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> overhead<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> ball<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
lot on the overhead because the ball is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.180 
lot on the overhead because the ball is
coming<00:00:39.030> down<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.290> there's<00:00:40.469> any<00:00:40.649> wind<00:00:41.010> at

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
coming down and if there's any wind at

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.799 
coming down and if there's any wind at
all<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> continue<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> move<00:00:42.629> your

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
all you want to continue to move your

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.650 
all you want to continue to move your
feet<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.950> under<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> ball<00:00:44.969> so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
feet so you get right under the ball so

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.220 
feet so you get right under the ball so
arms<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.850> why<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> arms<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.750> important

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
arms up why are the arms up so important

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.450 
arms up why are the arms up so important
well<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.250> hitting

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
well first of all this is your hitting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
well first of all this is your hitting
arm<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.300> why<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> need<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.260> left<00:00:52.649> arm<00:00:53.010> up

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
arm but why do you need that left arm up

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
arm but why do you need that left arm up
because<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.260> helps<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
because with this up it helps you to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
because with this up it helps you to
keep<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.129> head<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.910> has<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> eyeballs

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
keep the head up that has the eyeballs

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
keep the head up that has the eyeballs
they're<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> watch<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> ball<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
they're going to watch the ball if you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.520 
they're going to watch the ball if you
have<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> arm<00:01:00.480> down<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.320> you're

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
have the arm down like this you're

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
have the arm down like this you're
probably<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> come<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.489> too<00:01:02.969> soon<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
probably going to come down too soon and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.289 
probably going to come down too soon and
it's<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:05.070> better<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.670> balance<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's also much better for balance so the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.289 
it's also much better for balance so the
feet<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.750> moving<00:01:07.130> racket<00:01:08.130> head<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.549> then

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
feet are moving racket head up then

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
feet are moving racket head up then
you're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> drop<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.320> racket<00:01:10.590> head

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you're going to drop that racket head

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
you're going to drop that racket head
down<00:01:11.070> below<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.760> back<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> last

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
down below your back right at the last

down below your back right at the last
second<00:01:13.470> where<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> make

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
second where are you going to make

through together just like throwing a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.499 
through together just like throwing a
ball<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.799> rotate<00:01:23.400> through<00:01:23.759> together<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
ball so they rotate through together and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.070 
ball so they rotate through together and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
evenly balanced to forward onto that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
evenly balanced to forward onto that
front<00:01:31.829> foot<00:01:32.060> one<00:01:33.060> problem<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
front foot one problem that a lot of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.460 
front foot one problem that a lot of
people<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.939> win<00:01:36.720> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
are on that ball and then you're

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.000 
are on that ball and then you're
finishing<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.700> balance<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:13.140> you're<00:02:13.319> finishing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
finishing on balance if you're finishing

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.339 
finishing on balance if you're finishing
off<00:02:14.099> balance<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.019> probably

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
off balance like this then you probably

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.259 
off balance like this then you probably
haven't<00:02:16.739> done<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> great<00:02:17.340> job<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:18.209> your

footwork before you strike the overhead

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.690 
footwork before you strike the overhead
let's<00:02:20.970> check<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.360> out<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.230> here<00:02:22.650> arms<00:02:23.340> up

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
let's check it out so I'm here arms up

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.030 
let's check it out so I'm here arms up
right<00:02:23.849> away<00:02:24.180> ball<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.900> going<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.110> come<00:02:25.379> move

and the weight moving forward in the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.280 
and the weight moving forward in the
balance<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.269> Sun<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.299> lot<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.810> times<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
balance and the Sun a lot of times is a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.199 
balance and the Sun a lot of times is a
problem<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> overhead<00:02:35.579> actually<00:02:35.970> right

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
problem on the overhead actually right

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.330 
problem on the overhead actually right
