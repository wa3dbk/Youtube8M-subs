00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:10.010
 It is because I entered because it is today 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.910
 a I am here to lend to Honda-san, the end of last year to be released in December 2014 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.549
 Now I was 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.549
 It is an introduction of Honda Grace 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 Actually this is the sister car of this Grace Honda Fit 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.820
 But all also that chassis whether it engine Toka motor are you using the same parts 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.710
 Please also look at me, it's totally different 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.030
 Let's take a look at the details in the Well let's take a quick look at the detailed crawl 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.840
 Somehow it's to cool 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.150
 Part of the flower Do carved look at but it is good this tongue not there is something protruding Irun 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.590
 It is not- 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.870
 It looks like a parenthesis 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.870
 I will see the whole 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 Everywhere it's not hood hybrid I'm this I'm sedan 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.720
 Recently , it is quite common to say hybrids in this number-sized sedan 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.600
 Ne 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.100
 Well this Honda's I think I Well a little ages for people of increase was good to This is it 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 Well behind Yes I do is something like 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.750
 It was 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.680
 It is good, this sedan 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:29.980
 Well nowadays it's a hybrid, but the back is wide. 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:35.080
 Hood cobol wonder if the bag can go to Well care but is horizontal loading can likely space 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.860
 If it is a hybrid, it's narrow behind, but after all the battery is loaded everywhere 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.440
 Is it easy? 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:45.730
 A live it's wide Grace is part of the above but it is do voice Dolphin stable 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.460
 Let's open the doorknob like this 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.460
 It's interior is almost along with fit 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:17.129
 Hey Sporting design wildebeest 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.920
 Why a little more high now seeds I ne little that sitting height to ride to Yes injured seat 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:26.370
 Your head will hit, but 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:30.239
 The back seat is slightly narrowed a little but this foot is still still the back seat 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.810
 It is sized to fit one or two fists 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.739
 This number size sedan 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.849
 Terrible not so in the white better, is not it do it yet hybrid 7 beneath the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.990
 Right 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.020
 Grace is this back seat 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.050
 There is an air outlet 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.830
 This is fine, but the person behind you is riding 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.550
 Just this fit and it's about 100,000 yen . 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.660
 Well, maybe it's a design of a 6-year- old who is a bit older 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.390
 I think foreigners are indeed Civic 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.990
 Puchindo' the start button 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.990
 It contains the Suppon hah power 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.030
 There is no sound at all- 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.040
 Sabo is a hybrid 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.400
 It is difficult to navigate, but I'm not the grade of uneasy Maria 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.400
 But 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:36.740
 Said that Buber linear bran bath pop-chip aap ki ra Patty Innovation char imitate 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.360
 It contains silver ring 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.600
 me 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.530
 The rest is almost the same 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.940
 Let's look at the engine room for a moment 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.640
 It is incredible Horahora this is played 1.5-liter 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.050
 Next to that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.870
 I thought 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.770
 Hey 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.970
 Motor is on 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.970
 There Huh bing 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.430
 Yes I 'm just running with electricity 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.280
 It is quiet 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.280
 A little stepping on it will take a gasoline engine 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.489
 And this Grace is fine Cornering is good, is n't it? 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:28.139
 Pretty Hey this is hold a sense of the sheet is good 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:33.270
 I feel like it's a match 2 fold up to my back 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.020
 The motor and the engine are completely separated in this series of colors . 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.849
 Ne 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:42.380
 At first the output from the motor completely 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:45.800
 I will send it That's pretty good and there is power 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.430
 After all this clutch is dct 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:58.120
 The fuel efficiency is good, because dcd is directly connected . 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:02.760
 7 engine rotation is reflected in the output as it is in Moro 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.760
 Great power feels great power ぇ 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.990
 Now that place is on TV cm well, but cm is doing 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:20.760
 I feel like I'm going to the Uwasa with the feeling that the outing is sloppy 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:24.570
 I 'm going to put out the floor because I can get some speed in this tunnel from now on 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.300
 Let's step on a bit and the engine takes a while 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.470
 go 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.720
 me 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.740
 Beetle 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.100
 I have a conversation that seems to have been something turbo 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.680
 This 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:43.759
 I really wish you a little car sports car or something or anything brave. 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:49.900
 This green charge now when you slow down the engine 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:53.620
 It seems that the electricity is being charged by charge now. 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:58.080
 I used to run in normal mode until now, but this one 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.080
 Echo button I will send 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.440
 Here and there 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:10.390
 Now I can run all the way here 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:14.340
 Grace's shift knob is totally the same as the fit 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.760
 In this sport mode you press this and your sister is quite fine 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.120
 I was fine but still more 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.830
 If it is even more amazing it will take an engine from scratch 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.830
 Oh Oh not at all Satoshimichi 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:38.350
 The cat meter will come out right 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:41.680
 After all it is totally different from running out when it is in s mode after all 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:46.050
 I tried riding the example not say entered here Honda Grace 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.050
 It was Johnny nice 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.590
 Whoo eh 

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:53.310
 me 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.310
 ban 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.710
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.060
 def 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.419
 me 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.419
 deep 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.339
 Hmm 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.230
 goo 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.230
 Hmm 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.380
 Yeah yeah yeah
