 chabahar show and this is the charly show 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.859
 Chava will not be there because she sucks 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.859
 of person 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.910
 we need to talk 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.860
 the typical videos that have been put 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.860
 fashion where girls dancing 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.990
 but they dance 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.400
 they move 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 everyone here the girls have gone up a 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.360
 video they were dancing reggaeton or but 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.550
 it's not cute they just look so very 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.550
 together they are and it is not like that 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.930
 but remember that to upload this type 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.690
 of videos assholes must follow some 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.820
 rules 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.920
 Warriors 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.900
 but you have to follow 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 the tip number 1 is to deceive all 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.120
 people with the thumbnail of your video of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.300
 that you are very good very sexy 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.340
 with all the number two is to record your 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.250
 video with the coolest resolution was that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.250
 you can so it will look great 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.060
 dance as good as possible convert 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.240
 other types of videos that have become 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.790
 viral and in this case they are horribly 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 of fashion is so of super gameplays of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 minecraft we know that there are types that if 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.440
 they move content outside there are others that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.440
 if it is passed on river 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.020
 remember that follow the rules should be 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.090
 very important and here we are going to give you 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.120
 some recommendations on how to make a 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.550
 good video time number 1 remembers 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.740
 record always with a lot of lan and always 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.400
 lose always say rudeness 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.070
 and always change to some other outbreak 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.140
 always remember to always repeat always 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.140
 the same words like that 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.060
 always even if you have a speaker's voice 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.430
 You must make the most stupid voice possible 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.940
 this will give you a lot of rating and they will say 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.590
 wow, I hope 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.519
 you can fix it 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.519
 but I hope 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.390
 but the devil 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.640

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.270

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.050
 nobody is understood although I am 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.960
