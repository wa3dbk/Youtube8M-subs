00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.810
 ok today we are going to change the cable of 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.150
 reverse wave speedometer 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.389
 we need the cable of course in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.380
 this case is original pliers and a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.930
 star screwdriver 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.050
 in a couple of minutes will this be in 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.050
 March 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.380
 we dismantled first 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.520
 the bottom part with the outside of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.520
 star 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.780
 you have to leave right away because this 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.910
 cable is split 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.910
 which is 12 meters low 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.400
 now let's go to the top 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 we loosened 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.469
 until you can with your hand 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.720
 all right 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.050
 the cable comes out perfect 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.440
 we take the egg 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 and the first thing we have to do 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.320
 is to put it from the bottom 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.850
 we do not put up 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.140
 for the hooks that the motorcycle has 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 who has 2 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.720
 we put it according to the old man 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.350
 so there are no problems that 15 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.350
 montilla 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.980
 we take the screw 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.380
 let's squeeze and before you tighten it 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.380
 everything we put the above 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.120
 we put the cable 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.340
 and the sections with the branch as we can 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.209
 it seems that we did not know 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.530
 is crooked yes 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.530
 so much if we are going to see 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.890
 as the cable is very fair 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.210
 is that I do not want to force it and put it with 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.210
 the pliers 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.650
 this has to go 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.950
 with a very soft hand 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.490
 now you know 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.490
 all right 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.330
 now 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.230
 while everything 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.839
 logical 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.690
 there 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.380
 now 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.180
 Yes now 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.310
 squeeze as much as possible with the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.040
 hand 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.820
 and then a small return 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.520
 with the manufacturers 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.440
 quite 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.440
 and now we finish tightening 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.669
 the one below 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:18.020

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.120
