00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 all beaver dear friends with you windows 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:12.559
 I'm glad as usual everyone seems to be 10 days 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:15.179
 a new teaser will be coming out 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 between the sixth and seventh and I came out 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.000
 previous teaser with a nightmarish carnage and here 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.130
 now came out teaser with chiko so you can 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 just say that a new teaser and it looks like 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.869
 comes out every ten days and here 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.720
 look it in the background there is a cache 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.579
 barbie cupcake well now seriously 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.640
 consider this animatronic closer 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.640
 first thing we see u want his teeth 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.969
 seriously here is not even two rows 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.800
 teeth here are fucking 3-4 rows like that 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.899
 would prove that this animatronic isn't 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.190
 connected with the soldiers because well he was 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.640
 in two jaws 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.170
 However, the general view of this animatronic here 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 I can see a little bit that heâ€™s pretty 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.539
 yet a large body shows that this 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.390
 animatronic is any wrong or even itself 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.699
 her jaw is also moved away from her 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 heads like walt checks 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.930
 so I will continue to stand on my own 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 theories about what it's all old 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.270
 animatronics just created 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.210
 frightened child in his mind 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.159
 by the way, and with a torn cloth on her shoulder, I 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.890
 would say that it is different from 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.830
 previous animatronics and the nightmare is not 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.560
 hijacking we do not see this only a lid 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.689
 what it is and given that the hand of her 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.509
 turned at about the same angle as 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.890
 and hijacking it can be concluded that broke 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.930
 they have different ways 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.970
 which means that my guess on 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.159
 even though these animatronics had 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.619
 common origin but distinct 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.290
 true though still looking at the hand 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.390
 but now I am sure that the hand is not the same 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.420
 but I will see more lighting 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.030
 lighting a typical fight does not have its color 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.630
 Freddy has his color and Chika has j 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.360
 there are colors 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.070
 yellow stacks still considering what 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.049
 animatronics or rather 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 and teaser and comes out every ten days 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.670
 then up to 10 numbers somehow a bit too much I have 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.800
 until the tenth month will come out just a room 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.470
 chamber holders accordingly 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.560
 conclude that date 10 is actually 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.020
 31 15 refers to something else this 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.790
 definitely not a movie guys I assure you this is not 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.860
 the film does not need to shout that this film 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.640
 because movies are made much 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.770
 longer 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.690
 well, by the way, when we are there recently 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.990
 warner brothers in my promised movie 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.820
 by minecraft in 2015 and where is this movie 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.220
 so write in the comments like you 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.680
 think what is this really connected with 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.750
 date because either scott will slow down 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.650
 teasers release and so fit 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 on date 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.320
 either we will have millions of animatronics 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.870
 either this date is really not 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.740
 associated with the release it is associated with something 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.590
 to others 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.680
 however, with which we will discuss this in other 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.800
 video still there is one topic see the first 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.760
 teaser was one jaw second teaser two 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.970
 jaws 3 teaser 3 fishing line one teaser to 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.610
 jaw that is, foxy will soon appear with 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.520
 four jaws it certainly was 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.870
 probably it would be very scary at 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.660
 lighten pictures 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.000
 classic we see nightmar in the background 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.360
 the bottom of the check asks the same question 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.739
 was i what i said before everything 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.239
 these animatronics ask if it was me 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.900
 bite culprit 87 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.660
 still ucheche pressed frontal lobe 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.390
 is it just a design chip 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.820
 or is it some kind of crayon with him 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.010
 the classic burns only one eye 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.930
 Well, by the way, we do not see his hands like that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.239
 which technically says he has five 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.890
 fingers can not but we remember that 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.930
 the previous nightmares were five 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.200
 fingers rhythm and I think it's horrible 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.930
 check nifiga not exceptions but still there 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.030
 there is a little snag about which we 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.400
 already talk in the following videos 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.650
 I need to digest everything so that the jury can 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.680
 do not blurt out some crap all 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.680
 thanks for watching bye waka bye luck
