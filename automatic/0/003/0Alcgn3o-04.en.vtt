00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.069
 I came to ask the first one to bless us 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.819
 the German scientist miniskirts do not know the misinformation the spokesperson of 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.730
 s the delegate of summer do not see the region of laredo 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.619
 it's not okay but we're twelve at night tomorrow I understand but 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.579
 that's why people left you do not need initiative for which they attended more 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.090
 of 15 days congratulating the program but especially avon national site to the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.100
 wait for your new program of the program talking about heat 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.480
 you were with patricia so she explained patricia we talked specifically 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.810
 pool name something to keep in mind 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.989
 he was encouraged to say 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.550
 to capone and do something 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.230
 difficult to reach a technology with accessible today we can not talk until the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 garlic consumption and colors in pineta de hamas 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 nothing 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.390
 menem casting pledges promising central note pools that is fresh 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.120
 it was juniper and neither did it completely 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.450
 did not operate because we are happy because 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.900
 we have a detainee at least the green grass 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.410
 well let's look closely at the lighting benefits 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.360
 on the one hand 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.220
 who wants to know a constant to keep in mind especially the question 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 esthetic 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820
 good about the design 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.300
 in case you have to try to start to understand where they see scenes 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.040
 visuals 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.070
 main 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.570
 because only I have to see is the light 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.210
 n pool not the artifact that produces this light then generally it 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.700
 works the artifact with its back to the alec ahsoak main visual ring 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.470
 and awkwardly act can go inside the parade 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.120
 was the one that entities of artifacts will vary 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.200
 has a lot to do with the purpose of taking care of the environment there the cross appears without him 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.840
 the environment must never be hidden 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.870
 percy seven that the park has no destination 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.780
 the park when I left was hallucinated to be off patient 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.069
 after that amount do depending on many things and size 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 In the position where the artifacts are located, he decides what color will be 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.769
 make a caribbean skin color plan 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.349
 we have different colors of the pool and we know that the dark school absorbs 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.230
 much more light and light life colors reflect better so not having 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.359
 this example that we have here this white painted then has allowed 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.959
 optimize or minimize the eu agency 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.219
 Pitino seminar can be used 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.180
 well also in this case we have a variation 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.790
 There are motivational artifacts that are when you built the pool 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:43.169
 miguel sabah planned the artifact and such other action that she the atrocity of 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.419
 Apply 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:48.279
 when I built it, it did not apply with pools that we have to comply with and that 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.829
 today we want to nominate it then we arrive artifact that are very flat guys 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.969
 i leave perfectly with the licenses part of the museum 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.149
 good effective reaction that we can have common color 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:04.049
 if we can have color because today the lcd led technology is incorporated 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.099
 how do you know what 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.099
 and in embassy its consumption and has this possibility to incorporate color 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.069
 he says incorporate the color change that interests him we can work with rgb 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.349
 between shouts of goal colors that mixed produce in win 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.309
 the most interesting sheikh in the pools 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.799
 good to repeat the theme of low consumption does not matter 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.799
 good and it's very important that many think about the safety issue 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.159
 and important that is very important today we do not have to be afraid because 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.139
 we are working with 12 bag is not like in time ago that has time 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.419
 220 turned around and asks 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.359
 we try with 12 goals but the important thing is celestial action is supervised 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.169
 done by someone I deny that I manage to work with very good material 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.769
 he explained of course he put security and protection systems to be 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:56.589
 single 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:57.940
 yes or yes 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.250
 the swimming pool with lighting demand a social control to control 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.080
 So much so that those who are registered have been Palestinian, pity water in the middle 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.579
 of large fissures 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.399
 as the electrical issue 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:14.659
 and what happens with the pools and fiberglass, but that's where the video is 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.379
 you also have to foresee it in the project in this case its lukewarm inhabitants 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:19.389
 smart 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.059
 places 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.830
 course after placing him Sunday 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.259
 Well, if you have a sink and it tells us parallel perforations 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.479
 As you can 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.639
 and well they also add 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.430
 dominate in this case sandoval we have to lift explained 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.370
 but you can see here 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.240
 lafont muchachitos 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.030
 perforated labeled that the statistics in interaction with the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.590
 as if always from that state the ing 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.660
 duck is leaving firm area character invites a little later 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.999
 party more than pool 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.669
 when they finish technical notes that have taken enjoy the tiie rate 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.029
 that we have already maintained the whole year 70 years that we keep the water to not 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.240
 have to change 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.289
 Baena often accompanied meadow 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.860
 no thanks to you soon
