00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
racing so the experience goes up a very

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.240 
racing so the experience goes up a very
small<00:03:28.770> amount<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:29.459> all<00:03:29.790> good<00:03:31.250> let's

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
small amount but that's all good let's

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.370 
small amount but that's all good let's
have<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.570> look<00:03:33.600> Oh<00:03:33.810> horse<00:03:34.530> care<00:03:38.900> now<00:03:39.900> let's<00:03:40.110> see

if<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.680> helps<00:03:40.890> my<00:03:41.190> experience<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.270> think

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
if this helps my experience got I think

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.120 
if this helps my experience got I think
this<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:43.080> just<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.739> same<00:03:44.610> usual<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:46.130> has

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
this is just this same usual it just has

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.800 
this is just this same usual it just has
kind<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.459> reading<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.910> states<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.330> things<00:03:48.540> go

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
kind of reading the states and things go

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.270 
kind of reading the states and things go
up

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.420 

I'm<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.210> too<00:03:55.360> sure<00:03:55.800> no<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.830> think<00:03:57.010> it's<00:03:57.250> just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
I'm not too sure no I think it's just

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.380 
I'm not too sure no I think it's just
the<00:03:57.640> race<00:03:57.820> zone

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the race zone

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.700 
the race zone
I'm<00:03:58.810> your<00:03:59.140> experience<00:03:59.650> goes<00:03:59.890> up<00:04:01.710> that's

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
I'm your experience goes up that's

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.310 
I'm your experience goes up that's

really cool I'm gonna be racing racing

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.460 
really cool I'm gonna be racing racing
Racing<00:04:05.680> racing<00:04:05.710> because<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:07.420> doesn't<00:04:07.810> go<00:04:07.930> up<00:04:08.260> a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
Racing racing because it doesn't go up a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.010 
Racing racing because it doesn't go up a
lot<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.460> believe<00:04:10.090> that's<00:04:10.420> right<00:04:10.660> sorry

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
lot but I believe that's right sorry

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.590 
lot but I believe that's right sorry
I've<00:04:11.140> got<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.410> say<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:12.150> apparently<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.420> are

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
I've got to say that apparently you are

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.560 
I've got to say that apparently you are
able<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.080> unlock<00:04:14.500> more<00:04:15.280> tracks<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:16.000> more<00:04:16.180> the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
able to unlock more tracks the more the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.900 
able to unlock more tracks the more the
higher<00:04:16.750> level<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.140> get<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.829> that<00:04:18.730> is

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
higher level you get so that is

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.819 
higher level you get so that is
something<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:20.200> definitely<00:04:20.440> worthwhile

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
something that is definitely worthwhile

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.430 
something that is definitely worthwhile
doing<00:04:21.280> because<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.450> guess<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.960> higher<00:04:23.110> level

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
doing because I guess the higher level

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.070 
doing because I guess the higher level
you<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:23.680> get<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:25.300> bit<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.540> track<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:25.990> we

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
you can get up to the bit of track so we

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.480 
you can get up to the bit of track so we
oughtta<00:04:26.170> do<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> more<00:04:27.010> experience

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
oughtta do and the more experience

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.840 
oughtta do and the more experience
tricks<00:04:27.760> you're<00:04:27.940> able<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.780> compete<00:04:29.470> in<00:04:29.850> and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
tricks you're able to compete in and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.900 
tricks you're able to compete in and
