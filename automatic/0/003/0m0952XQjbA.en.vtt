a<00:00:28.079> loop<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.130> magic<00:00:29.669> because<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.270> can

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
a loop and it's magic because you can

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.670 
a loop and it's magic because you can
pull<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.710> tail<00:00:31.980> yarn<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
pull the tail yarn like so and it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.460 
pull the tail yarn like so and it
tightens<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.149> then<00:00:36.470> you

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
tightens it up like that and then you

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.220 
tightens it up like that and then you
can<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.190> becomes<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:39.090> beginning<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
can see it becomes your beginning of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.490 
can see it becomes your beginning of
your<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.680> round<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.260> slip<00:00:43.260> stitch

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
your first round then you slip stitch

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.230 
your first round then you slip stitch
into<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> first<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:44.580> continue<00:00:44.910> round

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
into the first one and continue round

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.510 
into the first one and continue round
that<00:00:45.420> way<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.410> you're<00:00:46.530> making<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.920> hats<00:00:47.190> or

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that way as if you're making a hats or

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
that way as if you're making a hats or
or<00:00:47.880> whatever<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.690> let's<00:00:48.990> show<00:00:49.380> you<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.560> to<00:00:49.740> do

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
or whatever so let's show you how to do

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.000 
or whatever so let's show you how to do
that<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:51.630> start<00:00:51.900> exactly<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.740> way

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that so you start exactly the same way

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.120 
that so you start exactly the same way
as<00:00:53.310> my<00:00:54.180> Slipknot<00:00:54.540> which<00:00:54.900> I'll<00:00:55.200> link<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.560> in<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
as my Slipknot which I'll link to in the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.450 
as my Slipknot which I'll link to in the
description<00:00:56.610> below<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> wrap<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> yarn

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
description below so you wrap the yarn

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.900 
description below so you wrap the yarn
around<00:00:59.730> these<00:01:00.239> two<00:01:00.510> fingers<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.170> overlap

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
around these two fingers and overlap

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.219 
around these two fingers and overlap
holding<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.390> tend<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.720> hold<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.019> with

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
holding it here I tend to hold this with

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.090 
holding it here I tend to hold this with
these<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.710> fingers<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.950> go

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
these two fingers and then we go

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
these two fingers and then we go
underneath<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.729> first<00:01:08.970> piece<00:01:09.329> of<00:01:09.540> yarn<00:01:09.689> over

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
underneath the first piece of yarn over

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
underneath the first piece of yarn over
the<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.430> second<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.170> pull<00:01:13.170> up

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the top of the second and pull up

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
the top of the second and pull up
twisting<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.400> hook<00:01:14.550> up<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.450> come

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
twisting your hook up as you come

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.180 
twisting your hook up as you come
through<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> hold<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.650> hold<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.890> stitch

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
through then I hold it hold this stitch

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.420 
through then I hold it hold this stitch
with<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.550> finger<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.510> go<00:01:21.890> underneath<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
with this finger and I go underneath the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.789 
with this finger and I go underneath the
yarn<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.720> pull<00:01:25.049> through<00:01:25.850> my<00:01:26.850> loop<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:30.450> finish

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
yarn and pull through my loop to finish

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.719 
yarn and pull through my loop to finish
technically<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> first<00:01:31.979> single<00:01:32.610> crochet

holding that in place you then hook yarn

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.920 
holding that in place you then hook yarn
over<00:01:56.840> like<00:01:57.840> that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
little secret I'll let you into I don't

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.859 
little secret I'll let you into I don't
actually<00:02:07.510> count<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:08.020> as<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> stitch<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:10.840> I

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
actually count this as a stitch when I

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.830 
actually count this as a stitch when I
when<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.320> sit<00:02:11.680> when<00:02:11.800> my<00:02:11.920> patterns<00:02:12.310> say<00:02:12.550> work<00:02:12.880> 10

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
when I sit when my patterns say work 10

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.470 
when I sit when my patterns say work 10
single<00:02:14.230> crochet<00:02:14.260> into<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.860> Magic<00:02:15.160> Circle<00:02:15.400> or<00:02:15.910> or

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
single crochet into a Magic Circle or or

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180 
single crochet into a Magic Circle or or
whatever<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.960> don't<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.500> count<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.040> as

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
whatever I don't actually count this as

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.680 
whatever I don't actually count this as
a<00:02:18.220> stitch<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> reason<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.450> is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
a stitch and the reason for that is

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.900 
a stitch and the reason for that is
because<00:02:19.750> when<00:02:20.230> you've<00:02:20.410> finished<00:02:21.220> your<00:02:21.580> magic

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
because when you've finished your magic

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.700 
because when you've finished your magic
ring<00:02:22.090> you've<00:02:22.300> pulled<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.960> tighten<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
ring you've pulled it to tighten it and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.740 
ring you've pulled it to tighten it and
you'll<00:02:24.310> slip<00:02:24.580> stitching<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.330> join<00:02:25.570> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
you'll slip stitching in to join the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.540 
you'll slip stitching in to join the
round<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.100> actually<00:02:27.400> surprisingly

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
round this is actually surprisingly

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.180 
round this is actually surprisingly
difficult<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.390> find<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.710> found<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.100> if

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
difficult to find and I found that if

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.160 
difficult to find and I found that if
you<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.460> use<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.090> as<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.240> dummy<00:02:31.510> stitch<00:02:31.870> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
you just use that as a dummy stitch and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.230 
you just use that as a dummy stitch and
then<00:02:32.350> work<00:02:32.590> your<00:02:32.740> 10<00:02:33.220> single<00:02:33.610> crochet<00:02:33.640> say

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
then work your 10 single crochet say

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.510 
then work your 10 single crochet say
it's<00:02:34.900> actually<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> lot<00:02:35.350> easier<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.160> find

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
it's actually a lot easier then to find

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.850 
it's actually a lot easier then to find
your<00:02:37.120> stitch<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.990> need<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.200> slip<00:02:38.410> stitch<00:02:38.650> into

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
your stitch you need to slip stitch into

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.800 
your stitch you need to slip stitch into
and<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.160> doesn't<00:02:39.490> affect<00:02:39.820> your<00:02:40.270> Magic<00:02:40.570> Circle

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
and it doesn't affect your Magic Circle

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.180 
and it doesn't affect your Magic Circle
in<00:02:41.680> any<00:02:41.830> way<00:02:41.980> I've<00:02:42.790> noticed<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:45.010> what

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
in any way I've noticed so that's what

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.420 
in any way I've noticed so that's what
we're<00:02:45.340> now<00:02:45.490> going<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.760> do<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.180> work<00:02:46.980> 10<00:02:47.980> single

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
we're now going to do is work 10 single

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.840 
we're now going to do is work 10 single
crochet<00:02:48.850> into<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:50.350> Magic<00:02:50.650> Circle<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.370> we

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
crochet into the Magic Circle so we

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.690 
crochet into the Magic Circle so we
don't<00:02:52.180> count<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.709> we<00:02:53.740> put<00:02:54.280> our<00:02:54.400> hook

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
don't count that one so we put our hook

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
don't count that one so we put our hook
through<00:02:55.380> through<00:02:56.380> our<00:02:56.560> loop<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:58.270> we<00:02:58.390> catch

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
through through our loop and we catch

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.510 
through through our loop and we catch
this<00:02:59.110> yarn<00:02:59.440> which<00:02:59.650> were<00:02:59.830> holding<00:03:00.220> with<00:03:00.370> these

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
this yarn which were holding with these

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.570 
this yarn which were holding with these
fingers<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.650> want<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.860> make<00:03:03.160> sure<00:03:03.400> that

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
fingers and you want to make sure that

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.270 
fingers and you want to make sure that
that<00:03:04.500> little<00:03:05.730> nubbin<00:03:06.959> keeps<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.230> stays<00:03:09.010> down

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
that little nubbin keeps it stays down

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.710 
that little nubbin keeps it stays down
there<00:03:09.340> if<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.760> starts<00:03:10.030> flipping<00:03:10.239> over<00:03:10.480> like

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
there if it starts flipping over like

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.620 
there if it starts flipping over like
that<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.110> can<00:03:11.320> make<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.650> very<00:03:11.800> difficult<00:03:12.070> to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
that it can make it very difficult to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.990 
that it can make it very difficult to
make<00:03:13.630> sure<00:03:13.870> your<00:03:14.050> stitches<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.500> neat<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:15.130> try

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
make sure your stitches and neat so try

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.470 
make sure your stitches and neat so try
and<00:03:16.150> keep<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.920> base<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.519> stitch<00:03:18.850> to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and keep that the base of that stitch to

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.530 
and keep that the base of that stitch to
that<00:03:19.660> side<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:21.370> doesn't<00:03:21.459> slip<00:03:21.880> around<00:03:21.940> so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
that side so it doesn't slip around so

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.110 
that side so it doesn't slip around so
just<00:03:22.570> put<00:03:23.440> your<00:03:23.470> hook<00:03:23.709> through<00:03:24.000> keep<00:03:25.000> your

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
just put your hook through keep your

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.979 
just put your hook through keep your
finger<00:03:25.450> there<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.780> stop<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.190> moving<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.989> just

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
finger there to stop that moving up just

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.060 
finger there to stop that moving up just
easier<00:03:29.410> said<00:03:29.590> than<00:03:29.709> done

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
easier said than done

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.620 
easier said than done
so<00:03:30.190> what<00:03:30.340> we<00:03:30.459> do<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.700> we<00:03:30.820> then<00:03:30.940> hook<00:03:31.209> all<00:03:31.360> yarn

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
so what we do is we then hook all yarn

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.860 
so what we do is we then hook all yarn
through<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.769> so<00:03:33.370> we've<00:03:33.489> got<00:03:33.640> two<00:03:33.940> loops<00:03:34.269> on

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
through and up so we've got two loops on

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.509 
through and up so we've got two loops on
the<00:03:35.620> hook<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:36.250> hook<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.209> yarn<00:03:37.510> again<00:03:38.519> and

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
the hook and then hook I yarn again and

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.280 
the hook and then hook I yarn again and
bring<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.910> through<00:03:39.940> both<00:03:40.870> loops<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:42.070> finish

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
bring it through both loops to finish

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:52.970 
bring it through both loops to finish
first<00:03:44.310> single<00:03:45.310> crochet<00:03:45.760> so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.570 

so<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.970> next<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.890> call<00:03:56.129> second

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
so the next one is so I call second

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.550 
so the next one is so I call second
single<00:03:56.910> crochets<00:03:57.300> we<00:03:57.540> put<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.810> hook<00:03:58.080> through

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
single crochets we put a hook through

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.970 
single crochets we put a hook through
the<00:03:58.830> loop<00:03:59.810> grab<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.050> yarn<00:04:01.290> with<00:04:01.800> your<00:04:01.830> hook

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
the loop grab the yarn with your hook

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.820 
the loop grab the yarn with your hook
and<00:04:02.519> pull<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.849> through<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.330> up<00:04:03.599> so<00:04:04.470> we've<00:04:04.620> got

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
and pull it through and up so we've got

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.140 
and pull it through and up so we've got
two<00:04:05.190> loops<00:04:06.379> like<00:04:07.379> so<00:04:07.769> hold<00:04:08.730> them<00:04:08.910> with<00:04:09.000> your

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
two loops like so hold them with your

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.520 
two loops like so hold them with your
finger<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.959> grab<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.709> yarn<00:04:10.920> again<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:12.530> pull

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
finger and grab the yarn again and pull

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.229 
finger and grab the yarn again and pull
it<00:04:13.800> through<00:04:13.920> both<00:04:14.220> loops<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:15.780> might<00:04:15.989> want<00:04:16.200> to

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
it through both loops you might want to

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.570 
it through both loops you might want to
hold<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.840> guide<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.350> through<00:04:20.090> like<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:22.580> and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
hold it to guide it through like so and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
hold it to guide it through like so and
the<00:04:23.760> hook<00:04:23.910> goes<00:04:24.150> through<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.720> loop<00:04:24.870> again

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
the hook goes through the loop again

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.629 
the hook goes through the loop again
oops

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
oops

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.460 
oops
that's<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:30.090> yard<00:04:30.450> but<00:04:31.139> it's<00:04:31.200> moving<00:04:31.770> up<00:04:33.470> cut

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
that's the yard but it's moving up cut

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.320 
that's the yard but it's moving up cut
see<00:04:34.800> on<00:04:34.979> again<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.919> bring<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.310> through<00:04:38.700> both

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
see on again and bring it through both

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.860 
see on again and bring it through both
loops<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.340> more<00:04:41.460> stitches<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.060> do<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
loops and the more stitches you do the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.190 
loops and the more stitches you do the
easier<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.470> does<00:04:43.680> get<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.300> because<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.870> kept

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
easier it does get so because you kept

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.080 
easier it does get so because you kept
that<00:04:46.380> one<00:04:46.560> need<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.860> start<00:04:47.310> with<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.729> these

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that one need to start with a these

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.440 
that one need to start with a these
working<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.720> lot<00:04:48.930> better<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.470> lot<00:04:49.650> neater<00:04:50.450> so
