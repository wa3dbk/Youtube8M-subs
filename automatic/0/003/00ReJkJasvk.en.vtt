00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.970 
brother said when he jacked this one up
he<00:02:10.750> had<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> flat<00:02:11.050> tire<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.500> he<00:02:11.560> jacked<00:02:11.830> this

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
he had a flat tire and he jacked this

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.580 
he had a flat tire and he jacked this
when<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.160> took<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.430> off<00:02:12.810> he<00:02:13.810> said<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.170> felt<00:02:14.320> rough

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
when I took it off he said it felt rough

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.290 
when I took it off he said it felt rough
to<00:02:14.740> him<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:15.310> least<00:02:15.430> I'm<00:02:15.670> pretty<00:02:16.000> sure<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.270> was

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
to him at least I'm pretty sure it was

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.900 
to him at least I'm pretty sure it was
this<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:18.370> know<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:18.520> spinning<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
this one but you know I'm spinning the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.990 
this one but you know I'm spinning the
tire<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.950> not<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.520> noisy

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
tire here and it's it's not really noisy

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.260 
tire here and it's it's not really noisy
I<00:02:25.150> think<00:02:25.570> there's<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.020> little<00:02:26.290> bit<00:02:27.120> because<00:02:28.120> of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
I think there's a little bit because of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.830 
I think there's a little bit because of
the<00:02:28.360> brakes<00:02:28.630> but<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:30.090> mean<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.239> really<00:02:31.420> spins

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the brakes but I mean it really spins

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.070 
the brakes but I mean it really spins
nice<00:02:32.110> huh<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.730> I'm<00:02:34.480> thinking<00:02:34.810> his<00:02:34.930> wheel

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
nice huh so I'm thinking his wheel

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.620 
nice huh so I'm thinking his wheel
bearing<00:02:35.380> may<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:35.680> fine<00:02:36.060> maybe<00:02:37.060> he<00:02:37.269> just<00:02:37.420> needs

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
bearing may be fine maybe he just needs

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.190 
bearing may be fine maybe he just needs
brakes<00:02:37.930> or<00:02:38.140> some<00:02:38.350> mm-hmm<00:02:39.989> maybe<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.110> little

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
brakes or some mm-hmm maybe a little

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.720 
brakes or some mm-hmm maybe a little
work<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.470> them<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.860> don't<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.100> I'll<00:02:42.430> have<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
work to them I don't know I'll have to

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.990 
work to them I don't know I'll have to
take<00:02:42.880> off<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> tire<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.510> lark<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.790> seems

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
take off the tire and lark but it seems

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.370 
take off the tire and lark but it seems
pretty<00:02:46.209> good<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:46.660> pretty<00:02:46.810> solid<00:02:47.050> in

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
pretty good and it's pretty solid in

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.000 
pretty good and it's pretty solid in
there<00:02:47.560> too<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:49.140> don't<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
there too so I don't think I have to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.400 
there too so I don't think I have to
replace<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:51.790> um<00:02:52.360> maybe<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
replace this one um maybe it was the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.160 
replace this one um maybe it was the
other<00:02:53.530> side<00:02:53.799> he<00:02:53.950> took<00:02:54.100> off<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:55.049> there's<00:02:56.049> no

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
other side he took off but there's no

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.750 
other side he took off but there's no
problem<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:56.739> that<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.160> tell<00:02:57.370> well

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
problem here that I can tell well

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.660 
problem here that I can tell well

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
than the other one I can barely even

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.090 
than the other one I can barely even
feel<00:03:15.280> those<00:03:15.489> middle<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.650> middle<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.829> shreds

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
this one no don't spin so free so it

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.310 
this one no don't spin so free so it
could<00:03:24.760> be<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.000> brakes<00:03:25.209> or<00:03:25.450> seized<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.110> there

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
could be the brakes or seized on there

I<00:04:32.759> was<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> lot<00:04:33.090> easier<00:04:33.120> than<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.509> thought<00:04:33.539> it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
I was a lot easier than I thought it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.260 
I was a lot easier than I thought it
would<00:04:33.930> be<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.430> as<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.449> can<00:04:36.539> see<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.810> shock<00:04:37.050> is

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
would be and as you can see the shock is

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.290 
would be and as you can see the shock is
pretty<00:04:39.270> much<00:04:39.419> gone<00:04:39.830> but<00:04:40.830> I'm<00:04:41.820> looking<00:04:42.090> at<00:04:42.210> the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
pretty much gone but I'm looking at the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.480 
pretty much gone but I'm looking at the
brakes<00:04:42.509> here<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.050> they're<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.889> little<00:04:44.070> bit<00:04:44.220> low

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
brakes here and they're a little bit low

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.939 
brakes here and they're a little bit low
but<00:04:45.620> I've<00:04:46.620> seen<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.889> lot<00:04:47.039> worse<00:04:47.340> no<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.949> it's

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
but I've seen a lot worse no the it's

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.350 
but I've seen a lot worse no the it's
quite<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> bit<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.460> rust<00:04:50.580> built<00:04:50.880> up<00:04:51.060> on<00:04:51.240> this

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
quite a bit of rust built up on this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.320 
quite a bit of rust built up on this
rotor<00:04:51.650> but<00:04:52.650> I'm<00:04:52.770> gonna<00:04:52.889> go<00:04:53.039> ahead<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.330> take

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
rotor but I'm gonna go ahead and take

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.010 
rotor but I'm gonna go ahead and take
these<00:04:54.479> brakes<00:04:55.080> off<00:04:55.349> and<00:04:56.750> see<00:04:57.750> if<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.990> changes

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
these brakes off and see if that changes

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.370 
these brakes off and see if that changes
how<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.560> spins<00:04:58.979> make<00:04:59.490> sure<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.759> brakes<00:05:00.380> and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
how it spins make sure the brakes and

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.350 
how it spins make sure the brakes and
then<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.740> caliper<00:05:02.130> ain't<00:05:02.280> seized<00:05:02.580> up<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.120> if

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
then the caliper ain't seized up and if

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.120 
then the caliper ain't seized up and if
it<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.630> I'll<00:05:03.870> just<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.260> to<00:05:04.349> replace<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.919> and

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
it is I'll just have to replace that and

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.129 
it is I'll just have to replace that and
if<00:05:05.280> it's<00:05:05.460> not<00:05:05.639> then<00:05:06.599> I'll<00:05:06.750> have<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:06.960> replace

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
if it's not then I'll have to replace

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.409 
if it's not then I'll have to replace
the<00:05:07.349> wheel<00:05:07.500> bearing<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.889> suppose<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.760> I'll<00:05:09.300> go

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
the wheel bearing I suppose so I'll go

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.800 
the wheel bearing I suppose so I'll go
ahead<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.780> undo<00:05:10.639> this<00:05:11.639> bolt<00:05:11.909> on<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.780> bottom

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
ahead and undo this bolt on the bottom

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.960 
ahead and undo this bolt on the bottom
here<00:05:13.380> see<00:05:13.770> if<00:05:13.889> I<00:05:13.949> can't<00:05:14.190> pry<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.430> up<00:05:14.580> it's<00:05:14.849> gonna

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
here see if I can't pry it up it's gonna

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.899 
here see if I can't pry it up it's gonna
be<00:05:15.560> pretty<00:05:16.560> tough<00:05:16.680> as<00:05:17.039> it<00:05:17.190> is<00:05:17.220> even<00:05:17.669> if<00:05:17.789> they're

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
be pretty tough as it is even if they're

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.230 
be pretty tough as it is even if they're
not<00:05:18.030> seized<00:05:18.419> because<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.050> this<00:05:19.729> this<00:05:20.729> big<00:05:20.940> rust

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
not seized because of this this big rust

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.560 
not seized because of this this big rust
Ridge<00:05:21.510> here<00:05:21.780> but<00:05:22.400> we'll<00:05:23.400> see<00:05:23.580> what<00:05:23.669> we<00:05:23.760> can<00:05:23.909> do

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.480 

yeah<00:05:27.570> that's<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.870> lot<00:05:28.020> darker<00:05:28.260> now<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.979> went<00:05:29.370> in

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
yeah that's a lot darker now I went in

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.960 
yeah that's a lot darker now I went in
and<00:05:29.699> warmed<00:05:29.970> up<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.270> got<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.389> bite<00:05:30.599> to<00:05:30.720> eat<00:05:30.780> and

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
and warmed up and got a bite to eat and

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.879 
and warmed up and got a bite to eat and
my<00:05:32.970> neighbor's<00:05:33.360> popping<00:05:33.810> off<00:05:33.930> shots<00:05:33.960> for<00:05:34.710> some

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
my neighbor's popping off shots for some

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.430 
my neighbor's popping off shots for some
reason<00:05:35.510> but<00:05:36.510> I<00:05:36.539> went<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.110> get<00:05:37.229> something

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
reason but I went in to get something

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.210 
reason but I went in to get something
eat<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:38.250> warm<00:05:38.490> up<00:05:38.699> and<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:38.909> came<00:05:39.090> back<00:05:39.270> out<00:05:39.510> and

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
eat and warm up and I came back out and

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.339 
eat and warm up and I came back out and
now<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.430> is<00:05:41.810> zero<00:05:42.810> degrees<00:05:43.260> and<00:05:44.000> art<00:05:45.050> but<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.199> got

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
now it is zero degrees and art but I got

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.890 
now it is zero degrees and art but I got
the<00:05:46.500> caliper<00:05:46.800> loose<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.240> got<00:05:48.389> it<00:05:48.479> slid<00:05:48.750> off

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the caliper loose and I got it slid off

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.899 
the caliper loose and I got it slid off
of<00:05:49.080> there<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:49.490> as<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:51.389> can<00:05:51.630> see<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:53.699> wheel

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
of there and as you can see the wheel

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.409 
of there and as you can see the wheel
bearing<00:05:54.270> spins<00:05:54.870> fine<00:05:55.229> which<00:05:55.710> is<00:05:56.270> kind<00:05:57.270> of<00:05:57.300> what

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
bearing spins fine which is kind of what

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.850 
bearing spins fine which is kind of what
I<00:05:57.449> thought<00:05:57.690> when<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:57.930> first<00:05:57.960> spun<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.470> wheel<00:05:58.590> it

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
I thought when I first spun the wheel it

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.830 
I thought when I first spun the wheel it
didn't<00:05:59.159> feel<00:05:59.400> you<00:06:00.000> know<00:06:00.090> like<00:06:00.150> wheel<00:06:00.479> bearing

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
didn't feel you know like wheel bearing

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.749 
didn't feel you know like wheel bearing
was<00:06:01.020> locking<00:06:01.620> up<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:01.979> felt<00:06:02.220> like<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.550> brakes

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
was locking up it felt like the brakes

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.430 
was locking up it felt like the brakes
were<00:06:02.940> stuck<00:06:03.210> on<00:06:03.530> so<00:06:04.530> I<00:06:04.919> think<00:06:05.250> now

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
were stuck on so I think now

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.330 
were stuck on so I think now
when<00:06:07.040> I<00:06:07.130> try<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.340> turn<00:06:07.520> this<00:06:07.670> back<00:06:09.310> you<00:06:10.310> can

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
when I try to turn this back you can

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.020 
when I try to turn this back you can
spin<00:06:10.790> that<00:06:10.820> in<00:06:11.150> and<00:06:11.930> actually<00:06:12.820> screw<00:06:13.820> it<00:06:13.880> back

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
spin that in and actually screw it back

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.060 
spin that in and actually screw it back
in<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.870> I'll<00:06:14.990> put<00:06:15.020> it<00:06:15.230> back<00:06:15.350> on<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:15.770> see<00:06:15.920> if<00:06:15.950> I

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
in and I'll put it back on and see if I

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.510 
in and I'll put it back on and see if I
get<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:16.310> stop<00:06:16.550> locking<00:06:16.970> up<00:06:17.800> but<00:06:18.800> if<00:06:18.920> I<00:06:19.040> can't<00:06:19.280> I

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
get it stop locking up but if I can't I

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.630 
get it stop locking up but if I can't I
may<00:06:19.880> have<00:06:20.030> to<00:06:20.150> get<00:06:20.270> a<00:06:20.330> new<00:06:20.510> caliper<00:06:21.320> so<00:06:21.740> go

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
may have to get a new caliper so go

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.980 
may have to get a new caliper so go
ahead<00:06:22.760> and<00:06:23.000> give<00:06:23.150> that<00:06:23.180> a<00:06:23.360> try<00:06:23.570> and<00:06:23.810> see<00:06:23.900> what

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
ahead and give that a try and see what

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.250 
ahead and give that a try and see what
happens

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.530 

now<00:06:27.260> I<00:06:27.290> managed<00:06:27.860> to<00:06:28.070> turn<00:06:28.700> that<00:06:28.880> piston<00:06:29.390> back

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
now I managed to turn that piston back

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.620 
now I managed to turn that piston back
in<00:06:29.810> ways<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.380> set<00:06:30.620> this<00:06:30.740> back<00:06:31.010> down<00:06:31.280> and

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
in ways and I set this back down and

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.970 
in ways and I set this back down and
bolt<00:06:32.630> it<00:06:32.750> back<00:06:32.930> in<00:06:33.140> and<00:06:33.290> hit<00:06:33.350> the<00:06:33.410> brakes<00:06:33.650> a<00:06:33.830> few

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
bolt it back in and hit the brakes a few

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.660 
bolt it back in and hit the brakes a few
times<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.460> pump<00:06:35.120> it<00:06:35.240> back<00:06:35.270> up<00:06:35.720> and<00:06:36.020> I<00:06:36.490> got<00:06:37.490> to

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
times to pump it back up and I got to

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.610 
times to pump it back up and I got to
spin<00:06:37.940> a<00:06:37.970> little<00:06:38.270> bit<00:06:38.420> better<00:06:38.630> well<00:06:39.380> a<00:06:39.410> lot

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
spin a little bit better well a lot

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.280 
spin a little bit better well a lot
better<00:06:39.860> than<00:06:40.070> it<00:06:40.220> did<00:06:40.340> it<00:06:40.490> didn't<00:06:40.700> spin<00:06:40.910> at<00:06:40.940> all

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
better than it did it didn't spin at all

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.650 
better than it did it didn't spin at all
before<00:06:42.290> but<00:06:43.060> you<00:06:44.060> know<00:06:44.120> there's<00:06:44.270> still<00:06:44.450> some

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
before but you know there's still some

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.620 
before but you know there's still some
drag<00:06:44.870> on<00:06:45.140> it<00:06:45.350> but<00:06:46.000> you<00:06:47.000> know<00:06:47.030> I<00:06:47.120> think<00:06:47.390> if<00:06:47.480> I

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
drag on it but you know I think if I

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.500 
drag on it but you know I think if I
maybe<00:06:48.560> take<00:06:48.890> that<00:06:48.920> out<00:06:49.250> and<00:06:49.550> push<00:06:50.000> your<00:06:50.120> piston

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
maybe take that out and push your piston

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.870 
maybe take that out and push your piston
back<00:06:50.660> in<00:06:50.900> and<00:06:51.050> in<00:06:52.040> and<00:06:52.190> out<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:52.460> work<00:06:52.580> it<00:06:52.730> back

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 
back in and in and out and work it back

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.880 
back in and in and out and work it back
and<00:06:52.910> forth<00:06:53.120> it<00:06:53.450> may<00:06:53.630> come<00:06:54.290> to<00:06:54.440> a<00:06:54.470> point<00:06:54.650> where

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
and forth it may come to a point where

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.780 
and forth it may come to a point where
it<00:06:55.330> doesn't<00:06:56.330> drag<00:06:56.720> so<00:06:56.990> much<00:06:57.250> but<00:06:58.250> it's<00:06:58.400> a<00:06:58.430> lot

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:58.790 
it doesn't drag so much but it's a lot

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.790 
it doesn't drag so much but it's a lot
better<00:06:58.820> no<00:06:59.240> at<00:06:59.960> least<00:07:00.140> I<00:07:00.260> only<00:07:00.380> have<00:07:00.530> to<00:07:00.650> buy<00:07:00.770> a

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
better no at least I only have to buy a

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.090 
better no at least I only have to buy a
new<00:07:00.950> wheel<00:07:01.130> ring<00:07:01.900> but<00:07:02.900> the<00:07:03.020> rotors<00:07:03.350> are<00:07:03.530> well

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
new wheel ring but the rotors are well

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.880 
new wheel ring but the rotors are well
as<00:07:04.820> you<00:07:05.000> can<00:07:05.060> see<00:07:05.120> they're<00:07:05.360> not<00:07:05.510> the<00:07:05.630> best<00:07:05.890> pads

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
as you can see they're not the best pads

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.970 
as you can see they're not the best pads
aren't<00:07:07.250> great<00:07:07.790> I<00:07:08.630> may<00:07:09.350> invest<00:07:09.740> in<00:07:09.890> that

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
aren't great I may invest in that

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.980 
aren't great I may invest in that
someday<00:07:10.430> but<00:07:11.060> if<00:07:11.150> I<00:07:11.240> can<00:07:11.330> get<00:07:11.450> this<00:07:11.570> wheel<00:07:11.810> to

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
someday but if I can get this wheel to

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.400 
someday but if I can get this wheel to
stop<00:07:12.230> locking<00:07:12.830> up<00:07:12.950> then<00:07:13.820> I<00:07:13.850> want<00:07:14.240> to<00:07:14.450> bother

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
stop locking up then I want to bother

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.210 
stop locking up then I want to bother
with<00:07:15.710> it<00:07:15.860> for<00:07:16.040> a<00:07:16.070> while<00:07:17.620> seeing<00:07:18.620> as<00:07:18.830> it's<00:07:19.040> kind

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
with it for a while seeing as it's kind

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.770 
with it for a while seeing as it's kind
of<00:07:19.250> late<00:07:19.430> I<00:07:19.610> think<00:07:19.670> I'm<00:07:19.940> gonna<00:07:20.090> call<00:07:20.480> it<00:07:20.540> a<00:07:20.750> day

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
of late I think I'm gonna call it a day

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.190 
of late I think I'm gonna call it a day
it's<00:07:21.200> cold<00:07:21.440> out<00:07:21.620> here<00:07:21.650> um<00:07:22.600> I'll<00:07:23.600> probably<00:07:23.780> call

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
it's cold out here um I'll probably call

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.300 
it's cold out here um I'll probably call
when<00:07:24.410> you're<00:07:24.530> here<00:07:24.650> again<00:07:24.740> tomorrow<00:07:25.130> when

when you're here again tomorrow when

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.970 
when you're here again tomorrow when
it's<00:07:25.430> warmer<00:07:25.790> and<00:07:26.530> just<00:07:27.530> check<00:07:27.830> everything

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
it's warmer and just check everything

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.350 
it's warmer and just check everything
out<00:07:28.250> make<00:07:28.580> sure<00:07:28.640> there's<00:07:28.910> nothing<00:07:29.180> on<00:07:29.270> the

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
out make sure there's nothing on the

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.990 
out make sure there's nothing on the

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 
back end and then I will move my way to

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.540 
back end and then I will move my way to
the<00:07:32.180> front<00:07:32.210> end<00:07:32.630> because<00:07:33.080> I<00:07:33.200> heard<00:07:33.350> a<00:07:33.490> kind<00:07:34.490> of

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550 
the front end because I heard a kind of

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.460 
the front end because I heard a kind of
a<00:07:34.640> clunking<00:07:35.030> noise<00:07:35.180> up<00:07:35.420> there<00:07:35.450> when<00:07:36.020> I<00:07:36.050> hit<00:07:36.320> the

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.470 
a clunking noise up there when I hit the

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.740 
a clunking noise up there when I hit the
washboards<00:07:37.100> on<00:07:37.250> the<00:07:37.370> dirt<00:07:37.550> roads<00:07:37.820> and<00:07:38.120> I'm

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
washboards on the dirt roads and I'm

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.050 
washboards on the dirt roads and I'm
thinking<00:07:39.170> that<00:07:39.320> might<00:07:39.530> be<00:07:39.680> a<00:07:39.790> sway<00:07:40.790> bar<00:07:41.030> end

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
thinking that might be a sway bar end
