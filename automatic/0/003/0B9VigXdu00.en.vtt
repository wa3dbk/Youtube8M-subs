00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.710
 Here in Costa do Sauipe is a super place 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.330
 pretty 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.960
 Can we enjoy a little later? 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.960
 the beach 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.340
 ae 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.529
 of the international cup is innovating this 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.530
 year the international cup every year comes 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.530
 innovating three days with three types of 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.510
 different proof and counter clock is 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.400
 and marathon race on Sunday 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.890
 enchantment was instant because the 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.900
 It's a wonderful place, she used to say 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.030
 a wonderful infrastructure of the coast 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.309
 the sauÃ­pe and the easy lane. 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.840
 condos with exceptional Carlos is 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.270
 brand new is the first time 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.000
 when he went in stages one and here 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.920
 test every day since it really changes 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.040
 lot three stages and a counter 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.229
 shrek watch and a marathon stage 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.240
 today on Sunday before this experience 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.490
 you need to have your evidence 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.000
 mountain bike and the work of 20 tests 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.380
 professional santa catarina 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.509
 the first time I participated in the test 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.160
 of 60 being amazing first test 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.740
 of the stage then the fault does not speak of 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.180
 step that agreement is a cheap hotel but it is 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.890
 the pace that is 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.320
 coaching we become more focused 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.759
 a day to complete it brings dynamics 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.620
 very different for competition 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.140
 mainly due to the concern that the 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.740
 athlete must have in the pre- and post- 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 each day 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.500
 a fairly efficient test is 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.630
 what stage of the saipe 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.159
 we have some great differences 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.210
 in relation to any other evidence that the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.240
 We had people for a year. 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.460
 the first is the type of land with 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.829
 with several sandbars in this stretch 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.679
 of technical education to the hottest part 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.869
 to do and the more technical part 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.000
 they stayed by the stretches of sand and 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.729
 really it is requiring a lot of power 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.729
 of the athlete since the circuit is very hard 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.980
 There is nothing technical but sand 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.590
 that sometimes until it does not walk then it has 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.040
 and perhaps even better because it is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.590
 have to be doing strength almost stopped 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.849
 maybe if you go down and push times is 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.700
 best on all sand strips 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.019
 It eventually wears me down a lot and a cable 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.970
 push in bahia I tried to 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.709
 difference in this from being pushed 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.930
 part of coconut there for the love of god 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.890
 I think it's very hard, it was the first time. 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.129
 that I saw these types of obstacles that 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.590
 was a fissile place has technical us 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.989
 caught up in some and already us 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.150
 we did several we used various techniques 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.510
 places such as coconut shells is what 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.060
 dubbed to extend but much sand and 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.569
 very wind crossed then with a test 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.319
 extremely hard 50 years of plan very 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.359
 heavy very hard chantra guinote 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.100
 ambient mount arena that we have 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.920
 here are some short and 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.870
 For thirty-five years, then this is another 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.209
 thing that greatly influences how 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.209
 piloting and the way you run the race 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 in this fair I made a time trial 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.030
 first time I 'm running against the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.280
 clock is a very hard test because 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.010
 you can not stop making percent 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.080
 at any point in the test because it requires 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.960
 too much of the snow athletes 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.310
 they really realized the power they 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.990
 they have to use not only against 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.300
 watch on friday as a short 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.760
 trash and also on Sunday which is a 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.820
 70 km marathon race and there goes 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.530
 require much technical and 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.510
 mainly physical of the athletes 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.990
 besides we have the factors 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.340
 is mainly from the heat there is 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.260
 that only after a lot of heat 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.960
 accustomed to the heat dry climate 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.540
 adversity but that little guy gave us 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.210
 we left before nine in the morning and 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.740
 It was very hot, but then I think I 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.570
 I know that races are asking for a bit of 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.250
 Heat that's what I'm used to. 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.200
 not as much as here that is a bit 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.170
 stuffy and rainy is very different 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.710
 through the blog higher than you to this 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:20.360
 is my trip to the police net 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.350
 crockery and destroyed them mad at me and I 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.690
 note motive silva cover the frau a 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.910
 I found this is an inheritance of parents in 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.650
 me wide international people the pantry 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.770
 two to have such heat - think 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.690
 heat here is a different heat and heat 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.450
 and very different from what normally 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.590
 is accustomed to country 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.080
 the asean of beak and very cold by the look 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.790
 our work of setting up the event 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.120
 we operate just for the people 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.900
 be able to withstand the weather condition 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.900
 here the bay 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.030
 rubinho moto is so much that won are 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.800
 linking five consecutive seasons of the 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.100
 national cup can see each step 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.070
 convinced may have fallen every lap a 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.450
 slap the front and then we do the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.690
 accounts and see how it was 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.690
 championship 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.569
 it ingredient that is pulse to that 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.490
 shock was very interesting and I 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.099
 men's test will grow as 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.189
 sportsman and I need 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.199
 quadrupled followed by half an hour 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.360
 follow below the more that I looked at 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.499
 back Ecuadorian was strong but 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.960
 now that I've left the road alone 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:40.180
 opened many of the other 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.270
 that the cup closed with a golden key 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.020
 closed with 1 as proof worthy of 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.020
 last stage of the championship 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.170
 one of the great goals with certainty 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.760
 international cup is over win the o 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.460
 general of the national cup for me is 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.710
 really a very big weight like how 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.020
 professional athlete is the dream that I 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.750
 I had since when I started so it's 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.910
 this year I explained how my goal is 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.720
 thank god everything worked out every step 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.950
 I could grow a little 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.990
 during the year 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.990
 I'm super happy and I just have to thank you.
