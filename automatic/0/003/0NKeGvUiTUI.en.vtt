on that science and maths when they are

that works with that works for them or
maybe<00:01:16.830> fits<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.610> maybe<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> stereotyping

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
maybe fits into maybe the stereotyping

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810 
maybe fits into maybe the stereotyping
for<00:01:18.780> their<00:01:18.869> gender<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.770> from<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.040> early<00:01:20.460> we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
for their gender so from very early we

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
for their gender so from very early we
see<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.119> girls<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.450> given<00:01:21.750> kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.380> pink

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
see that girls are given kind of pink

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010 
see that girls are given kind of pink
toys<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.280> dolls<00:01:23.490> toys<00:01:23.759> rather<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.420> cars<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
toys and dolls toys rather than cars and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
trucks and kind of Lego and mechanic to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
trucks and kind of Lego and mechanic to
play<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
play with so we see a lot of that and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
play with so we see a lot of that and
but<00:01:29.430> also<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> number<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> girls<00:01:30.930> who

but also there are a number of girls who

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
but also there are a number of girls who
maybe<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> fear<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> fact<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.700> they

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
maybe a fear for the fact that if they

they<00:01:35.189> won't<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.490> able<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> good

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
they won't be able to also be a good

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.480 
they won't be able to also be a good
mother<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.600> example<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:38.040> woman<00:01:38.369> I'll

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
mother for example be a good woman I'll

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.560 
mother for example be a good woman I'll
be<00:01:38.579> able<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.820> fulfill<00:01:38.970> some<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> their<00:01:39.450> other

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
be able to fulfill some of their other

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.090 
be able to fulfill some of their other
roles<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.200> does<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> has<00:01:40.860> come

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
roles so they does that and has come

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
roles so they does that and has come
from<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.729> -<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.329> must<00:01:42.659> seem<00:01:42.840> bizarre<00:01:43.020> when

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
from there - you must seem bizarre when

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.429 
from there - you must seem bizarre when
you<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> does<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:45.540> does<00:01:45.750> seem<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.079> bizarre

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you it does it does seem really bizarre

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.690 
you it does it does seem really bizarre
but<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.649> think<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> definitely<00:01:47.220> comes<00:01:47.549> from

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
but I think it definitely comes from

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
but I think it definitely comes from
media<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.090> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> images<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.810> put

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
media and kind of the images that put

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410 
media and kind of the images that put
two<00:01:49.320> girls<00:01:49.500> early<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.149> women

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
two girls early on they don't see women

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
two girls early on they don't see women
scientist<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.229> example<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.740> television<00:01:53.280> or

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490

in<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> media<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.750> anywhere<00:01:55.590> else<00:01:55.619> where<00:01:55.799> they

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
in the media or anywhere else where they

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
in the media or anywhere else where they
kind<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.460> these<00:01:56.640> images<00:01:57.149> coming<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.049> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
kind of get these images coming in so

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
kind of get these images coming in so
for<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> isn't<00:01:59.820> compatible<00:02:00.240> being

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
for them it isn't compatible being

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.810 
for them it isn't compatible being
working<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.350> technology<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.219> being

working in technology and kind of being

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.580 
working in technology and kind of being

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
like computer coder in a darkroom

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
like computer coder in a darkroom
doesn't<00:02:05.369> fit<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.820> being<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.390> mother<00:02:06.509> or

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
doesn't fit with being a mother or

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.029 
doesn't fit with being a mother or
doesn't<00:02:07.079> fit<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.320> being<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> woman<00:02:07.770> or

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
doesn't fit with being a woman or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
doesn't fit with being a woman or
doesn't<00:02:08.280> fit<00:02:08.310> with<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.849> being<00:02:09.090> happy

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
doesn't fit with you know being happy

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
doesn't fit with you know being happy
and<00:02:09.869> successful<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.069> were<00:02:11.160> one

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and successful and so you you were one

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.449 
and successful and so you you were one
of<00:02:11.459> three<00:02:11.730> girls<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.450> 70<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> think<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
of three girls out of 70 I think so

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.640 
of three girls out of 70 I think so
math<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.969> computer<00:02:14.390> science<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.959> university

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
math and computer science at university

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.690 
math and computer science at university
yeah<00:02:15.920> what<00:02:16.069> was<00:02:16.189> that<00:02:16.219> like<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.909> was<00:02:17.750> used<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.200> it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
yeah what was that like I was used to it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.770 
yeah what was that like I was used to it
often<00:02:19.700> when<00:02:19.849> you're<00:02:19.969> the<00:02:20.060> only<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.599> in

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
often when you're the only going in

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.780 
often when you're the only going in
class<00:02:21.140> you're<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.829> only<00:02:22.010> girl<00:02:22.189> before<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.670> go

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
class you're the only girl before you go

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.920 
class you're the only girl before you go
to<00:02:22.849> university<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.569> when<00:02:23.659> you're<00:02:23.780> studying

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
to university and when you're studying

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.849 
to university and when you're studying
when<00:02:24.170> you're<00:02:24.290> younger

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
when you're younger

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.530 
when you're younger
so<00:02:25.099> university<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.790> continuum<00:02:26.329> of<00:02:26.420> that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so university just a continuum of that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.209 
so university just a continuum of that
and<00:02:26.719> even<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.989> industry<00:02:27.230> you're<00:02:27.859> often<00:02:28.010> the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
and even in industry you're often the

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.470 
and even in industry you're often the
only<00:02:28.310> woman<00:02:28.549> in<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.849> room<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.239> it's<00:02:29.390> not

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
only woman in the room so it's not

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.539 
only woman in the room so it's not
really<00:02:29.870> you're<00:02:30.469> not<00:02:30.530> really<00:02:30.769> it's<00:02:31.370> not<00:02:31.430> really

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
really you're not really it's not really

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.550 
really you're not really it's not really
an<00:02:31.760> issue<00:02:31.879> at<00:02:32.269> all<00:02:32.480> you're<00:02:33.109> not<00:02:33.139> in<00:02:33.319> your<00:02:33.439> head

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
an issue at all you're not in your head

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.170 
an issue at all you're not in your head
room<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.920> agree<00:02:34.159> this<00:02:34.340> your<00:02:34.639> experience<00:02:34.730> as

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
room you agree this your experience as

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.580 
room you agree this your experience as
well<00:02:35.299> yeah<00:02:35.599> absolutely<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.139> I'm<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.379> structural

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
well yeah absolutely so I'm a structural

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.470 
well yeah absolutely so I'm a structural
engineer<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.310> think<00:02:37.579> we<00:02:37.819> are<00:02:37.849> on<00:02:38.269> average

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
engineer and I think we are on average

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.819 
engineer and I think we are on average
in<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> industry<00:02:39.260> about<00:02:39.319> seven<00:02:39.680> or<00:02:39.769> eight

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
in the industry about seven or eight

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.589 
in the industry about seven or eight
percent<00:02:40.010> women<00:02:40.579> in<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> industry<00:02:40.879> my

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
percent women in the industry my

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.030 
percent women in the industry my
companies<00:02:42.019> work<00:02:42.170> better<00:02:42.349> with<00:02:42.680> twenty

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
companies work better with twenty

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.129 
companies work better with twenty
percent<00:02:43.340> women<00:02:43.549> but<00:02:44.150> I'm<00:02:44.329> very<00:02:44.540> very<00:02:44.659> often

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
percent women but I'm very very often

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.780 
percent women but I'm very very often
the<00:02:45.260> only<00:02:45.379> woman<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.280> room<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.579> often

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the only woman in the room and often

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.670 
the only woman in the room and often
lots<00:02:46.939> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> youngest<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.530> different

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
lots of the youngest is it different

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.129 
lots of the youngest is it different
though<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.310> India<00:02:49.879> where<00:02:50.269> maths<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.810> science

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
though in India where maths and science

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.929 
though in India where maths and science
and<00:02:51.379> girls<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.040> mix<00:02:52.310> seems<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.819> bit

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
and girls the mix seems to be a bit

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.030 
and girls the mix seems to be a bit
better<00:02:53.090> absolutely<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.049> think<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.500> was<00:02:54.889> brought

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
better absolutely I think I was brought

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.349 
better absolutely I think I was brought
up<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.340> India<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> lived<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.060> until<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.329> was

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
up in India so I lived there until I was

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.780 
up in India so I lived there until I was
16<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.139> the<00:02:57.709> fact<00:02:57.889> that<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.040> love<00:02:58.340> maths<00:02:58.609> and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
16 and the fact that I love maths and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.459 
16 and the fact that I love maths and
science<00:02:59.090> was<00:02:59.209> not<00:02:59.450> strange<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.049> wasn't<00:03:00.319> out<00:03:00.439> of

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
science was not strange it wasn't out of

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.470 
science was not strange it wasn't out of
the<00:03:00.620> norm<00:03:00.919> we<00:03:01.189> all<00:03:01.370> studied<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.879> together<00:03:02.239> and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
the norm we all studied it together and

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.869 
the norm we all studied it together and
so<00:03:02.930> I'd<00:03:03.019> like<00:03:03.169> to<00:03:03.319> see<00:03:03.469> that<00:03:03.739> mentality<00:03:04.489> kind

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
so I'd like to see that mentality kind

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.580 
so I'd like to see that mentality kind
of<00:03:04.969> brought<00:03:05.150> forward<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.840> lots<00:03:06.409> more

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
of brought forward to lots more

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.149 
of brought forward to lots more
countries<00:03:07.159> as<00:03:07.310> well<00:03:07.959> Emory<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.230> think<00:03:09.950> it's

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
countries as well Emory I think it's

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.619 
countries as well Emory I think it's
okay<00:03:10.549> if<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.730> tell<00:03:10.909> people<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.450> ask

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
okay if I tell people that you ask

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.809 
okay if I tell people that you ask
somewhat<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.079> a<00:03:12.139> genius<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.859> that<00:03:13.099> what<00:03:13.669> it

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
somewhat of a genius is that what it

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.349 
somewhat of a genius is that what it
takes

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
takes

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.509 
takes
in<00:03:14.480> order<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.810> achieve<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.560> do<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.919> have<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.310> be

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
in order to achieve so do you have to be

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.580 
in order to achieve so do you have to be
that<00:03:16.849> good<00:03:17.090> absolutely<00:03:17.659> not

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
age of 20 and I guess that was just I

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.909 
age of 20 and I guess that was just I
was<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.199> was<00:03:30.349> fortunate<00:03:30.500> enough<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.799> be

was I was fortunate enough to be

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.949 
was I was fortunate enough to be
nurtured<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:32.120> be<00:03:32.209> allowed<00:03:32.419> to<00:03:32.449> explore<00:03:32.780> my

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
nurtured and to be allowed to explore my

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.469 
nurtured and to be allowed to explore my
passion<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.439> know<00:03:33.590> two<00:03:33.769> passes<00:03:34.159> by<00:03:34.909> my<00:03:35.030> parents

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
passion I know two passes by my parents

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.479 
passion I know two passes by my parents
and<00:03:35.659> by<00:03:36.109> those<00:03:36.260> around<00:03:36.500> me<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:37.069> know<00:03:37.099> it<00:03:37.370> was

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
and by those around me you know it was

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.250 
and by those around me you know it was
it<00:03:37.790> was<00:03:38.030> strange<00:03:38.329> but<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.659> was<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> Murray's

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
it was strange but it was a Murray's

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.599 
it was strange but it was a Murray's
think<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.769> was<00:03:39.859> what<00:03:39.949> a<00:03:39.979> Murray<00:03:40.220> was<00:03:40.370> allowed

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
think that was what a Murray was allowed

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.729 
think that was what a Murray was allowed
to<00:03:40.639> do<00:03:40.909> she<00:03:41.120> was<00:03:41.239> an<00:03:41.479> exception<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:42.229> it<00:03:42.620> was

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
to do she was an exception so it was

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.349 
to do she was an exception so it was
fine<00:03:42.889> I<00:03:42.919> didn't<00:03:43.220> play<00:03:43.340> with<00:03:43.430> dolls<00:03:43.609> houses<00:03:43.819> all

know my office is very mixed it's very
normal

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
normal

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.930 
normal
to<00:04:26.260> be<00:04:26.380> in<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.530> room<00:04:26.710> with<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.250> mixed<00:04:27.669> group<00:04:27.850> of

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
to be in a room with a mixed group of

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.210 
to be in a room with a mixed group of
people<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.540> think<00:04:28.900> on-site<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:29.710> definitely

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
people I think on-site is definitely

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.250 
people I think on-site is definitely
more<00:04:30.370> male<00:04:30.669> dominated<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:31.840> think<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.080> comes

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
more male dominated and I think it comes

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.870 
more male dominated and I think it comes
down<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.770> having<00:04:32.919> confidence<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.820> that's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
down to having confidence and that's

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.129 
down to having confidence and that's
definitely<00:04:34.150> something<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.660> I've<00:04:34.900> had<00:04:35.080> to

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
definitely something that I've had to

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.780 
definitely something that I've had to
develop<00:04:35.470> over<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.010> years<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.669> you<00:04:36.729> think

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
develop over the years do you think

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.750 
develop over the years do you think
women<00:04:37.240> have<00:04:37.930> issues<00:04:38.290> across<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.070> board<00:04:39.250> with

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
women have issues across the board with

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.650 
women have issues across the board with
confidence<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.419> think<00:04:41.260> they<00:04:41.350> do<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.520> I

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
confidence I think they do and so I

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.050 
confidence I think they do and so I
think<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.870> think<00:04:43.930> some<00:04:44.229> women<00:04:44.470> do<00:04:45.010> find<00:04:45.970> it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
think I think some women do find it

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.450 
think I think some women do find it
different<00:04:46.300> kind<00:04:46.990> of<00:04:47.080> posture<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.949> be

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
different kind of posture and be

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.189 
different kind of posture and be
shouting<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.120> guess<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.510> is<00:04:49.600> that<00:04:49.780> your<00:04:49.930> way<00:04:50.050> we

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
shouting I guess and is that your way we

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.860 
shouting I guess and is that your way we
raised<00:04:50.470> oh<00:04:51.210> that's<00:04:52.210> an<00:04:52.300> interesting<00:04:52.389> question

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
raised oh that's an interesting question

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.870 
raised oh that's an interesting question
I<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.830> some<00:04:54.130> women<00:04:54.250> are<00:04:54.460> raised<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.729> way

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
I think some women are raised that way

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.659 
I think some women are raised that way
um<00:04:55.120> definitely<00:04:56.020> again<00:04:56.620> kind<00:04:57.190> of<00:04:57.220> societal

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
I'm quite a fan of the book actually and

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.129 
I'm quite a fan of the book actually and
I<00:05:18.430> took<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:19.120> advice<00:05:19.240> about<00:05:19.539> sitting<00:05:19.960> at<00:05:20.080> the

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
I took the advice about sitting at the

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.110 
I took the advice about sitting at the
table<00:05:20.440> quite<00:05:20.620> literally<00:05:21.070> not<00:05:21.550> very<00:05:21.760> many<00:05:21.940> days

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
table quite literally not very many days

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.150 
table quite literally not very many days
ago<00:05:22.450> so<00:05:22.660> I<00:05:22.720> think<00:05:23.020> it's<00:05:23.260> very<00:05:23.650> important<00:05:24.070> I

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
ago so I think it's very important I

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.010 
ago so I think it's very important I
think<00:05:24.190> we<00:05:24.820> have<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.090> push<00:05:25.270> ourselves<00:05:25.449> even<00:05:25.870> if

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
think we have to push ourselves even if

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.629 
think we have to push ourselves even if
we<00:05:26.139> seem<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.530> be<00:05:26.680> quite<00:05:26.919> confident<00:05:27.490> in

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
we seem to be quite confident in

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.300 
we seem to be quite confident in
ourselves<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.240> often<00:05:29.199> there's<00:05:29.440> an<00:05:29.830> internal

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
ourselves and often there's an internal

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.490 
ourselves and often there's an internal
struggle<00:05:30.550> inside<00:05:30.940> you<00:05:31.720> know<00:05:31.840> trying<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.289> push

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
struggle inside you know trying to push

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.810 
struggle inside you know trying to push
us<00:05:32.680> forward<00:05:32.830> more<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.280> that's<00:05:33.400> something<00:05:33.610> we

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
us forward more so that's something we

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.090 
us forward more so that's something we
need<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.090> work<00:05:34.240> on<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.660> Marie<00:05:35.080> how<00:05:35.260> do<00:05:35.320> men

expecting<00:05:46.270> me<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.419> kind<00:05:46.599> of<00:05:46.660> look<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.870> little

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
expecting me to kind of look a little

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.659 
expecting me to kind of look a little
bit<00:05:47.229> more<00:05:47.380> geeky<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:48.010> guess<00:05:48.220> with<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.400> glasses

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
bit more geeky I guess with the glasses

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.890 
bit more geeky I guess with the glasses
and<00:05:48.910> everything<00:05:49.120> he<00:05:49.330> looked<00:05:49.510> a<00:05:49.539> little<00:05:49.570> bit

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
and everything he looked a little bit

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.360 
and everything he looked a little bit
more<00:05:50.080> I<00:05:50.320> don't<00:05:50.830> know<00:05:50.889> what<00:05:51.039> he<00:05:51.099> was<00:05:51.190> expecting

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
to be honest a some people and sometimes

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.870

are intimidated but I think for others

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.120 
are intimidated but I think for others
it's<00:05:55.120> they<00:05:55.750> recognize<00:05:56.260> me<00:05:56.440> as<00:05:56.590> someone<00:05:56.979> who

smart to say to bring to the table and

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:02.879 
smart to say to bring to the table and

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
and smarter and not necessarily I think

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.440 
and smarter and not necessarily I think
it<00:06:06.010> comes<00:06:06.190> down<00:06:06.310> to<00:06:06.550> the<00:06:06.700> confidence<00:06:07.150> again<00:06:07.419> I

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
think if we've got an opinion that we

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.850 
think if we've got an opinion that we
want<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.599> suggest<00:06:10.599> to<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.080> table<00:06:11.440> we<00:06:11.590> need<00:06:11.740> to
