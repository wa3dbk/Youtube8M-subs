here<00:05:21.719> let's<00:05:22.719> start<00:05:22.840> off<00:05:23.080> with<00:05:23.349> these

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
here let's start off with these

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.450 
here let's start off with these
satellites<00:05:24.069> so<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:25.360> get<00:05:25.539> 35<00:05:25.990> watts<00:05:26.319> RMS<00:05:26.860> for

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
satellites so you get 35 watts RMS for

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.510 
satellites so you get 35 watts RMS for
each<00:05:27.699> satellite<00:05:28.210> at<00:05:28.750> 6<00:05:29.229> ohms<00:05:29.440> each<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.979> the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
total RMS of 200 watts and you get a

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.589 
total RMS of 200 watts and you get a
frequency<00:05:38.050> response<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.770> 35<00:05:39.580> Hertz<00:05:39.819> to<00:05:40.000> 20,000

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
greater than 103 decibels we've gone

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.920 
greater than 103 decibels we've gone
ahead<00:05:45.339> and<00:05:45.490> tested<00:05:46.089> these<00:05:46.210> speakers<00:05:46.479> using

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
ahead and tested these speakers using

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.589 
ahead and tested these speakers using
the<00:05:47.020> true<00:05:47.349> RTA<00:05:47.770> software<00:05:48.339> and<00:05:48.580> these<00:05:49.180> are<00:05:49.419> the

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
the true RTA software and these are the

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.779 
the true RTA software and these are the
results<00:05:49.870> before<00:05:50.710> I<00:05:50.740> interpret<00:05:51.279> them<00:05:51.460> I<00:05:51.490> would

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
results before I interpret them I would

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.430 
results before I interpret them I would
like<00:05:51.819> to<00:05:52.089> mention<00:05:52.240> that<00:05:52.449> these<00:05:52.779> speakers<00:05:53.229> were

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
like to mention that these speakers were

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.790 
like to mention that these speakers were
not<00:05:53.650> tested<00:05:54.219> in<00:05:54.430> a<00:05:55.210> soundproof<00:05:55.839> environment<00:05:56.620> -

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
not tested in a soundproof environment -

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.040 
not tested in a soundproof environment -
it's<00:05:56.979> a<00:05:57.129> natural<00:05:57.610> office<00:05:58.120> setting<00:05:58.449> so<00:05:58.839> the

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
it's a natural office setting so the

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.820 
it's a natural office setting so the
results<00:05:59.500> are<00:05:59.650> not<00:06:00.099> completely<00:06:00.849> accurate<00:06:01.539> and

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
results are not completely accurate and

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.339 
results are not completely accurate and
also<00:06:02.830> for<00:06:03.669> a<00:06:03.699> perfect<00:06:04.360> speaker<00:06:04.930> test<00:06:05.169> it

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
also for a perfect speaker test it

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.140 
also for a perfect speaker test it
should<00:06:05.650> be<00:06:05.979> a<00:06:06.129> perfect<00:06:06.669> straight<00:06:07.120> line

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
should be a perfect straight line

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.469 
should be a perfect straight line
however<00:06:07.839> that<00:06:08.589> is<00:06:08.710> impossible<00:06:09.039> to<00:06:09.490> achieve<00:06:09.610> so

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
however that is impossible to achieve so

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.600 
however that is impossible to achieve so
let's<00:06:10.690> go<00:06:10.870> ahead<00:06:11.169> and<00:06:11.379> see<00:06:11.800> what<00:06:12.279> these

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
let's go ahead and see what these

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.749 
let's go ahead and see what these
results<00:06:12.969> have<00:06:13.389> to<00:06:13.539> say<00:06:13.719> so<00:06:14.529> I<00:06:14.979> want<00:06:15.279> to<00:06:15.400> mention

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
results have to say so I want to mention

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.930 
results have to say so I want to mention
first<00:06:15.969> that<00:06:16.449> the<00:06:16.930> speaker<00:06:17.469> range<00:06:17.680> is<00:06:18.009> 35<00:06:18.639> Hertz

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
first that the speaker range is 35 Hertz

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.760 
first that the speaker range is 35 Hertz
to<00:06:20.159> 20,000<00:06:21.159> Hertz<00:06:21.400> so<00:06:22.319> let's<00:06:23.319> start<00:06:23.589> off<00:06:23.740> here

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
to 20,000 Hertz so let's start off here

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.909 
to 20,000 Hertz so let's start off here
at<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.550> low<00:06:24.759> end<00:06:25.110> we're<00:06:26.110> just<00:06:26.139> going<00:06:26.529> to<00:06:26.589> kind

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
at the low end we're just going to kind

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.920 
at the low end we're just going to kind
of<00:06:26.979> dismiss<00:06:27.729> this<00:06:27.879> area<00:06:28.180> because<00:06:28.539> this<00:06:28.719> is

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
of dismiss this area because this is

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.469 
of dismiss this area because this is
between<00:06:29.289> twenty<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:29.830> thirty<00:06:30.479> thousand

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
between twenty and thirty thousand

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.629 
between twenty and thirty thousand
thirty<00:06:31.930> Hertz<00:06:32.440> so<00:06:32.919> we're<00:06:33.039> gonna<00:06:33.129> start<00:06:33.490> off

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
thirty Hertz so we're gonna start off

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.939 
thirty Hertz so we're gonna start off
right<00:06:34.000> here<00:06:34.360> at<00:06:34.509> thirty-five<00:06:35.169> Hertz<00:06:35.529> you'll

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
right here at thirty-five Hertz you'll

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.010 
right here at thirty-five Hertz you'll
notice<00:06:36.219> that<00:06:36.310> it<00:06:36.430> is<00:06:36.550> still<00:06:36.789> a<00:06:36.849> bit<00:06:37.300> quieter

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
notice that it is still a bit quieter

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.559 
notice that it is still a bit quieter
than<00:06:38.199> it

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
than it

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.109 
than it
be<00:06:38.809> with<00:06:39.259> the<00:06:39.379> dip<00:06:39.589> here<00:06:39.919> but<00:06:40.249> it<00:06:40.580> starts<00:06:40.969> to

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:41.119 
be with the dip here but it starts to

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:43.329 
be with the dip here but it starts to
kind<00:06:41.300> of<00:06:41.419> normalize<00:06:41.899> as<00:06:42.199> it<00:06:42.559> goes<00:06:42.710> along<00:06:42.919> and

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:43.339 
kind of normalize as it goes along and

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.629 
kind of normalize as it goes along and
you<00:06:43.819> see<00:06:44.059> that<00:06:44.270> most<00:06:44.869> of<00:06:45.139> this<00:06:45.460> most<00:06:46.460> of<00:06:46.550> this

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
you see that most of this most of this

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.059 
you see that most of this most of this
result<00:06:47.119> is<00:06:47.419> following<00:06:48.110> a<00:06:48.319> relatively

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
result is following a relatively

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.730 
result is following a relatively
straight<00:06:49.520> line<00:06:49.879> with<00:06:50.449> a<00:06:50.479> few<00:06:50.779> spikes<00:06:51.050> here<00:06:51.499> and

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
straight line with a few spikes here and

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.820 
straight line with a few spikes here and
dips<00:06:52.009> there<00:06:52.309> and<00:06:52.869> here<00:06:53.869> between<00:06:54.080> about<00:06:54.770> a

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
dips there and here between about a

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.269 
dips there and here between about a
belief<00:06:55.159> 4500<00:06:57.129> and<00:06:58.779> 8000<00:06:59.779> Hertz<00:07:00.080> who<00:07:00.679> notice<00:07:01.069> a

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:01.279 
belief 4500 and 8000 Hertz who notice a

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.989 
belief 4500 and 8000 Hertz who notice a
very<00:07:01.729> pretty<00:07:02.569> smooth<00:07:03.110> line<00:07:03.679> here<00:07:04.189> following<00:07:04.669> a

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:04.999 
very pretty smooth line here following a

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:09.399 
very pretty smooth line here following a
straight<00:07:05.479> line<00:07:05.779> and<00:07:07.449> and<00:07:08.449> over<00:07:08.689> here<00:07:09.020> at<00:07:09.229> the

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:09.409 
straight line and and over here at the

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:12.760 
straight line and and over here at the
very<00:07:09.439> end<00:07:09.770> near<00:07:10.219> the<00:07:10.249> about<00:07:10.969> I<00:07:11.240> believe<00:07:11.770> 18,000

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
very end near the about I believe 18,000

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.609 
very end near the about I believe 18,000
or<00:07:12.860> so<00:07:13.099> you<00:07:13.819> get<00:07:13.969> some<00:07:14.539> spikes<00:07:14.899> which<00:07:15.169> means<00:07:15.439> it

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:15.619 
or so you get some spikes which means it

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.609 
or so you get some spikes which means it
is<00:07:15.709> performing<00:07:16.339> louder<00:07:17.149> than<00:07:17.599> it<00:07:17.629> should<00:07:18.139> but

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:18.619 
is performing louder than it should but

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:20.859 
is performing louder than it should but
these<00:07:19.189> are<00:07:19.580> the<00:07:19.819> general<00:07:20.180> results<00:07:20.719> and

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:20.869 
these are the general results and

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:23.379 
these are the general results and
overall<00:07:21.469> I'd<00:07:21.709> say<00:07:21.740> they<00:07:22.430> performed<00:07:23.089> rather

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:23.389 
overall I'd say they performed rather

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:26.409 
overall I'd say they performed rather
