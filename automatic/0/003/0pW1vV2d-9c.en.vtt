00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
right now so since there are three

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.810 
right now so since there are three

option or how does that work out the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.720 
option or how does that work out the
driver<00:02:22.800> will<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.100> able<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.340> select<00:02:23.520> which

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
driver will be able to select which

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.360 
driver will be able to select which
option<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.300> want<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.100> let's<00:02:26.250> talk

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
option they want and now let's talk

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.160 
option they want and now let's talk
about<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.880> charging<00:02:27.450> now<00:02:27.570> how<00:02:27.810> long<00:02:27.959> would<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
about the charging now how long would it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.010 
about the charging now how long would it
take<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> 110<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.490> 240<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
take what a 110 to 240 and then the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.180 
take what a 110 to 240 and then the
doesn't<00:02:31.440> work<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.740> fast<00:02:31.950> charge

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
doesn't work with the fast charge

longer<00:04:08.970> than<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.450> it's<00:04:10.019> probably<00:04:10.320> going<00:04:10.470> to

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
longer than that it's probably going to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.990 
longer than that it's probably going to
take<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.829> an<00:04:10.950> evening<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.640> just<00:04:11.760> get

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
take you an evening so if you just get

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.819 
take you an evening so if you just get
home<00:04:12.180> plug<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.600> in<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.810> your<00:04:12.930> garage<00:04:13.110> in<00:04:13.680> the

home plug it in in your garage in the

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.080 
home plug it in in your garage in the
morning<00:04:14.100> you'll<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.519> equivalent<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:15.000> a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
morning you'll have the equivalent of a

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.509

full<00:04:15.299> tank<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.630> gas<00:04:16.070> I've<00:04:17.070> heard<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> lot<00:04:17.400> about

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
full tank of gas I've heard a lot about

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.940 
full tank of gas I've heard a lot about
that<00:04:17.940> DC<00:04:18.390> fast<00:04:18.690> charge<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.350> go<00:04:19.560> up<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.769> eighty

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
that DC fast charge to go up to eighty

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.710 
that DC fast charge to go up to eighty
percent<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> half<00:04:20.850> hour<00:04:21.030> would<00:04:21.660> that

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
percent of like a half hour would that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.960 
percent of like a half hour would that
work<00:04:21.780> with<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.410> think<00:04:23.039> that's<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.430> model<00:04:23.669> s

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
work with this I think that's a model s

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.680 
work with this I think that's a model s
focus<00:04:24.979> innovation<00:04:25.979> yeah<00:04:26.300> another<00:04:27.300> vehicle

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
focus innovation yeah another vehicle

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
they your company makes the model this

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.600 
they your company makes the model this
is<00:04:29.970> what<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.180> just<00:04:30.330> looked<00:04:30.539> at<00:04:30.750> yeah<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:32.430> any

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
is what we just looked at yeah so any

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.529 
is what we just looked at yeah so any
other<00:04:32.850> remarks<00:04:33.539> about<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.960> tesla<00:04:34.500> roadster

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
other remarks about this tesla roadster

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.120 
other remarks about this tesla roadster
you<00:04:36.539> know<00:04:36.660> it's<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> first<00:04:37.440> car<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:37.800> we've

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
you know it's the first car that we've

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.980 
you know it's the first car that we've
built<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.610> was<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:38.970> first<00:04:39.210> DV<00:04:39.539> that<00:04:39.750> really

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
built it was the first DV that really

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.930 
built it was the first DV that really
was<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.169> catalyst<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.950> entire<00:04:41.310> industry

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
was the catalyst for the entire industry

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.969 
was the catalyst for the entire industry
as<00:04:42.030> far<00:04:42.240> as<00:04:42.330> electric<00:04:42.720> cars<00:04:42.960> go<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.740> goes

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
as far as electric cars go it goes

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.450 
as far as electric cars go it goes
farther<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.789> it<00:04:44.940> charges<00:04:45.630> faster<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:47.340> a

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
farther and it charges faster and it's a

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.770 
farther and it charges faster and it's a
faster<00:04:47.880> car<00:04:48.060> than<00:04:48.240> almost<00:04:48.390> any<00:04:48.690> other

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
faster car than almost any other

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.690 
faster car than almost any other
electrics<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.500> are<00:04:49.590> out<00:04:49.710> really<00:04:50.550> been

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
electrics that are out really been

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.130 
electrics that are out really been
groundbreaking<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.539> I<00:04:51.570> think<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:51.900> really

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
groundbreaking and I think it's really

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.390 
groundbreaking and I think it's really
turned<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.440> industry<00:04:52.830> towards<00:04:53.100> electric

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
turned the industry towards electric

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.770 
turned the industry towards electric
cars<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.789> general<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.690> the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
cars in general so this is the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.270 
cars in general so this is the
grandfather<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.560> electric<00:04:56.070> car

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
grandfather of the electric car

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.820 
grandfather of the electric car
revolution<00:04:57.030> if<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.180> think<00:04:57.479> about<00:04:57.539> it<00:04:57.830> forgot

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
revolution if you think about it forgot

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.159 
revolution if you think about it forgot
to<00:04:58.950> ask<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.310> price<00:04:59.729> tag<00:04:59.970> on<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.140> is

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
to ask the price tag on it so this is

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.840 
to ask the price tag on it so this is
the<00:05:01.260> base<00:05:01.440> price<00:05:01.740> tag<00:05:02.039> for<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.550> hundred

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
the base price tag for this is a hundred

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.969 
the base price tag for this is a hundred
and<00:05:02.940> nine<00:05:03.120> thousand<00:05:03.570> dollars<00:05:03.900> it's<00:05:04.680> going<00:05:04.919> to

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
and nine thousand dollars it's going to
