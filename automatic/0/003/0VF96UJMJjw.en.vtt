00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
 Today I'll show you with foil glue 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.440
 the fw tesafilm like me my gifts 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.330
 and with a swiss team already 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.910
 the package packed 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.510
 I'll stick a bow on it 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.070
 with the film and that's what we do 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.080
 once with the awesome 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 We have to be one centimeter from that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:40.160
 package to the middle of both sides with it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:53.000
 for the 0 4 degrees go 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:55.770
 and then we do a cross about 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.539
 so the sand art that I make 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:10.170
 then you want to take the glue best 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:29.790
 about as cuts that piece makes 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:32.000
 you two stripes of yore for the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.000
 page 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.530
 then we take the long stripes here 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.170
 then I have two small ones here 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:32.670
 stripes cut it looks like this 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 as if that one can still here on the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.650
 side connection 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.959
 namely no e10 no films stick 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:26.720
 It can be in different colors too 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:26.720
 model now an idea with foil glue
