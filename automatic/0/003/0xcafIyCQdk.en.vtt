00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.860
 hello and welcome to the video here 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.759
 I would like to use an acer 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.589
 notebooks 158 10 ps show what you can do 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.079
 problems with the windows activation 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.320
 can do and what software 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.119
 this is the problem to solve this 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.220
 if such a notebook crashes once 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.349
 The software is growing problems in the windows 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.419
 You install this often 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.269
 I also like to have to go new sometimes 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.800
 and of course you have to do that too 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.960
 Normally reactivate 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.059
 the problem is that this whole 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.739
 computer manufacturer like acer lenovo hp 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 etc 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.910
 they usually have their own use 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.859
 own data carrier and then it works 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.289
 sometimes not with the activation 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.030
 The notebooks are on the bottom 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.370
 mostly a sticker on it at windows 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 vista and windows 7 are always included 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 -8 never more if you have windows 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.969
 vista windows 7 has as in this now 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 If so, then you should go down here 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.809
 look at this sticker and that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.519
 either photograph or photograph the number 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.559
 then write it off because we then set it up 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.570
 the other side must type in here 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.020
 if the manufacturer here for example 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.030
 acer has a recovery cd attached and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320
 you have - you have installed it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.660
 usually no problems 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.060
 but mostly the cd is gone or she 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 was never there and then you in 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.090
 other volume taken from one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.440
 known from another manufacturer 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.580
 or one 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.560
 universal boot cd from microsoft emc de 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.560
 then you usually have these problems 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 here that there are problems with the knee 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.580
 here then says the microsoft windows 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 activation of the entered product key 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.310
 is not valid for activation 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.020
 possible solution new buy at 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.670
 enter product key microsoft to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 Contact the solution of the problem 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.390
 You do not want the former you have 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.250
 already paid that brings the latter 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.260
 we do not guarantee anything so we have to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.690
 first enter the key and that the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.090
 also on the bottom because here too 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.940
 another cd has been used as 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 It was meant for delivery 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
 I have the key here now 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.150
 typed in by windows of the bottom of the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.460
 housing was what we just saw 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.990
 and then click on continue here and 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.630
 Now he brings this activation 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.220
 Error with the error code 0x 10 00 40 03 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.500
 There are plenty of these error codes 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.240
 Of course, that brings the same 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 user relatively little not activated 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.730
 is not activated in the case though 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.739
 also not right because of this license 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.780
 which was bought which is paid 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.209
 glued on it and you have it 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.100
 definitely a license the problem here 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.430
 this is the volume of the windows 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.890
 installed was not 100% compliant 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.400
 as it has introduced the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.010
 and there it is now turn and there are 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 in this are still stored values 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.610
 we have to delete them now 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 here below click on start and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.500
 then type in a cmd and hit up here 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.480
 he then before 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.910
 cmd, click with the right mouse button 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.800
 on it and open the program as 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.050
 administrator if this message comes 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.500
 continue yes no always continue 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.610
 click 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.180
 in the console tippmann now a sl mba 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.150
 and then one free and question mark 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.680
 the program is in windows at this 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.920
 all windows versions that is the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.330
 software license manager and with that can 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 one of these licenses of this 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.960
 change activation code or can 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.640
 re-enable windows 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.040
 You do not need to download that 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.099
 is as I said here 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.719
 is perfectly legal and with - 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.939
 question mark you can get all the commands 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.299
 let's have a look here 's it 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:44.060
 all these options for this command 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.579
 - pk brocki install replaces the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.629
 Activate existing qi - auto for 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.760
 example glitter information display 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.370
 show detailed information 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.819
 Expiration date for the license 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.329
 status indications etc 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.950
 There's more here down here 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.730
 you then license, among other things 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.739
 install or here the license status 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.840
 reset the computer so completely on 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.150
 set zero because of the use 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.010
 from the oecd of another 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.959
 Manufacturers are there parts of 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.759
 already been made 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.949
 they are no longer compliant with 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.680
 the real khider here on this device 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.810
 So this is what we need 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.810
 this series on 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:32.229
 So here's a tap slm grrr 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.639
 and press enter 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.780
 and now this license became 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.610
 information deleted 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.280
 Now you have to restart the computer 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.870
 you have to go to this window 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.740
 expect commands became successful 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.270
 completed 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.520
 restart the system so that the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.530
 changes take effect ok acer 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.210
 notebook is now restarted in the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.050
 Activation said three more days 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.760
 remain 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.949
 that's good so this one 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.500
 changes give this command has 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.210
 What does he do before that? 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.710
 two days now there are again three so 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.400
 this dissociation was complete 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.530
 reset 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.979
 and now we go again this 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.830
 product key 1 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.510
 the hungarian , it is now again 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.389
 So given the the and on it 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.250
 click on it to continue and then 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.889
 continue here look what he then 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.990
 Now if these windows 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.760
 Activation error 0x 10 00 40 03 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.639
 shows up or repeatedly shows up 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.370
 after several attempts then it lies 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.680
 with certainty that these windows 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.680
 version does not fit the notebook and 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.750
 also not to this key there are 32 and 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.670
 64 bit versions and that can 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.010
 so be a cause if yours 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.890
 notebook was shipped with windows 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.350
 7 windows vista and you have new 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.780
 installed from the other cd of one 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.890
 known from the other notebook of 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.500
 another manufacturer 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.230
 which was the same version, too 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.760
 home premium or professional and these 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.380
 message comes anyway though in the 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.390
 you entered the right key below 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.810
 sticks on it then you probably have 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.020
 instead of a 32 bit 64 bit version or 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.750
 reversed or installed that 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.030
 is very annoying and then you have to 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.880
 reinstall the old delete and 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.190
 the right important version 32bit or 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.740
 64bit suitable for this child 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.540
 install if you do that again 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.419
 trying to activate comes then mostly 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.820
 the message of the entered product key 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.160
 is not valid for activation 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.640
 but it would be natural and it stands 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.870
 here not the bit version does not fit 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:42.169
 to the kac 32 or 64 bit either new 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.880
 buy project and or another 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.650
 Enter key then you have of course 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.510
 You do not want to buy it so it does not 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.110
 is probably easier if you can 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.270
 then a 32 64 bit version worried 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.950
 the right cd installed and then 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.080
 Again with this product idea here 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.120
 on it sticks activated if one windows 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.940
 reinstalled with each 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.850
 other version so 32 instead of 64 or 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.710
 many sure 32 bit one can windows 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.840
 synonymous back to normal here activate 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.060
 with the tiger on the notebook below 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.590
 it is, of course, a pity that 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.290
 you can not see by the key 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.990
 which version meant but not every 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.330
 Windows version can be either 32 or 64 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.700
 optionally installed 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.210
 microsoft is very good on some keys 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.210
 English
