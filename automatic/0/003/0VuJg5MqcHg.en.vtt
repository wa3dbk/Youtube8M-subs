00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.589
 hello guys and girls I'm hac miguel look 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:09.940
 and today I have a videotutorial of how 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:11.620
 install a virtual machine on mac the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.480
 virtual machine that will benefit more from the sun 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.970
 this operating system windows 7 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 well it 's easy enough you need two 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 main things you need this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.410
 program that is the virtual box that the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 link in the description of the page 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.419
 official so you can download it 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.810
 it's for mac obviously and it's a 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:40.570
 you need is this what is this because it is 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.580
 is an iso file that is an image of 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.550
 disc is worth then this is the image of 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.530
 windows 7 disk then with this what 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.020
 What we can do is install the windows 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.160
 7 basically but good we will not be in 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.440
 our computer itself but in this in 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.630
 a virtual machine then once 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 you have the program for that new 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.190
 the next s here you can call him I'm going 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.060
 to put 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.850
 windows 7 because it has been original and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.800
 even you already go by directly 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.310
 windows 7 although you can select more 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.620
 times linux ubuntu I have here another one of 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 ubuntu created but good doubt 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.180
 select this windows 7 there are two types 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.040
 there are 64 bits and 32 bits is the one that I'm going 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.320
 to hang by the way I'll also leave the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.110
 description is 32 bits worth not 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 you wrong put this windows 7 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.300
 with nothing next to it, then the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.380
 next very well here you can 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.770
 select it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.810
 the base ram base memory 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.530
 So here it says that the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.289
 recommended is 512 mb good to be able 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.479
 upload it and download it and such I am already like 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.509
 you want the truth is that with 500 ac 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.729
 nobody is going quite well not sometimes 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.880
 can work but well the truth is 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.539
 that what he used for is perfect 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.539
 the next girl 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.569
 do not forgive creating new virtual hard disk 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.550
 as well as it was by default following 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.240
 following 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.230
 Next, then, here you are going to 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.989
 be a folder that is a paste of 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.629
 everything will be stored and you can 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.640
 select the size of the hard disk 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.069
 then it is already perfect 20 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.049
 gigabytes 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.999
 this is depending on what you want 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.359
 stored and what you want to use 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:40.159
 save etcetera 20 megabytes gigabytes 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:44.269
 sorry it's pretty pretty good no 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:46.730
 it's wrong you can have even two 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.159
 terabytes that the truth is that it's pretty 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.909
 I do not think it's necessary that 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:56.959
 put so many terabytes besides that in 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.879
 few 200 jobs but good we go 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.230
 to give the next one maybe I'm wrong 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.459
 but well I'm not an expert on this 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.459
 let's create 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.250
 and here is windows 7 is worth then 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.370
 Now you have to start 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.490
 was to pass this you will see it welcome the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.490
 next following initial 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.730
 although it comes out stop 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.060
 and this is worth this is because here you have to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.850
 do and you have to do the second step not 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.090
 you can give it to start and it's 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.310
 it is necessary to put this iso is worth then 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.720
 how this is done, we select the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.720
 windows 7 configuration 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.340
 and storage 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.340
 and here this 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.550
 Valera is here 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.930
 and a virtual disk file is designated 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.440
 then those are the elections this 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.790
 is the x 15 blah blah blah the windows 7 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.540
 vice open causes here something worth is 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.920
 accept and very well now you will have to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.220
 work let's try let's give 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.220
 Start 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.019
 You see, it's starting 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.090
 perfect windows and bugle files you can 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.549
 change the view you can give it to mode 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.549
 adjusted and so you can 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.310
 shit 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:38.660
 You can move the bar up and go 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.660
 it's worth being in windows 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.569
 They are going to take a little time but not 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.620
 too much because good the first time 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.680
 that starts 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.020
 but you leave it here, it's already here 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.350
 the typical small windows that come out in 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.350
 windows 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.940
 and here you see the mouse 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.600
 good continued here beige this is for 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.810
 install the language 6 itself that was 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.569
 digital that next and that installs 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.099
 now it's worth 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.589
 then the distraction is 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.759
 starting good I'm going to cut the video 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:17.220
 here 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.840
 because this is already easy to do it 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.370
 we can not have any problem if 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.520
 have a problem do not hesitate 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.110
 comment and comment on the video and if 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.990
 you liked it I hope you read like or 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.120
 subscribe to my channel soon 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.860
 I'm going to upload videos besides see upload 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.480
 videos for a website called ai 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.400
 filter 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.410
 that I will leave you also click on the link in 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.380
 the description that is not yet there 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.350
 is in is not created at all 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.760
 is in process but well we are a 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.530
 friend and me that is let's make videos 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.960
 of computer science and such that good that 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.200
 maybe there is that I will take care of the 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.180
 clearest part about the stainless steel and windows 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.730
 it's quite pretty good quality of 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.790
 material the truth I knew 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.130
 enough or whether we spent the 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.470
 website because certainly a good one 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.510
 good tool then good we go 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.120
 we continue with this here you see that ya 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.710
 says this he accepted the following terms 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.760
 but now I 'm going to close it, it's worth it 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.400
 the time is not here because it would take a long time 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.750
 off beige off and that's it 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.700
 you can keep turning on and off 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.280
 as you want is like having another 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.290
 computer on your computer and well up 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.490
 here the video I hope you liked it 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.490
 one to all and goodbye
