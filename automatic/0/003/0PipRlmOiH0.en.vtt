you<00:00:00.359> know<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.570> two<00:00:00.719> ways<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:01.110> sum<00:00:01.319> it<00:00:01.350> up<00:00:01.560> in

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
you know the two ways to sum it up in

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.849 
you know the two ways to sum it up in
terms<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.129> our<00:00:02.310> our<00:00:02.639> philosophy<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:04.380> number

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
terms of our our philosophy is is number

terms of our our philosophy is is number
one<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.460> better<00:00:05.640> experience<00:00:05.970> through

good<00:00:06.509> design<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:09.410> actually<00:00:10.410> want<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> use

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
good design we actually want to use

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.030 
good design we actually want to use
design<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.849> make<00:00:12.389> sure<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.019> enhance<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
design to make sure that we enhance the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.730 
design to make sure that we enhance the
interaction<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> device<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.619> the

of the Apple device how can we properly

of the Apple device how can we properly

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
protect the phone and make sure that we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.400 
protect the phone and make sure that we
don't<00:00:29.220> prohibit<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> phone

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
don't prohibit the use of the phone

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
don't prohibit the use of the phone
without<00:00:31.800> understanding<00:00:32.099> those<00:00:32.579> things<00:00:32.850> that

without understanding those things that

without understanding those things that
we<00:00:33.600> don't<00:00:33.780> actually<00:00:34.079> understand<00:00:34.649> those

we don't actually understand those

we don't actually understand those
things<00:00:35.040> until<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.600> phone<00:00:36.750> in

things until we can have the phone in

things until we can have the phone in
our<00:00:37.079> hand<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.950> were<00:00:38.489> able<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.910> fully

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
our hand we were able to fully

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
our hand we were able to fully
understand<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> nature<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> device

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
understand the nature of the device

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.280 
understand the nature of the device
before<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.640> started<00:00:42.000> our<00:00:42.120> design<00:00:42.450> process<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
before we started our design process so

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.430 
before we started our design process so
in<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:44.160> case<00:00:44.430> which<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:45.000> surprising<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
in this case which was surprising I

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.420 
in this case which was surprising I
think<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.460> glass<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.890> amount<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
think is the glass the the amount of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.450 
think is the glass the the amount of
coverage<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.239> glass<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> fact<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
coverage of glass and the fact that the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
coverage of glass and the fact that the
glass<00:00:53.760> wraps<00:00:54.239> around<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> side<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> phone

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
glass wraps around the side of the phone

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
glass wraps around the side of the phone
is<00:00:56.010> probably<00:00:56.789> something<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.480> other

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
is probably something that other

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
is probably something that other
companies<00:00:58.230> weren't<00:00:58.590> able<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.010> anticipate<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
companies weren't able to anticipate and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.170 
companies weren't able to anticipate and
we<00:01:00.750> knew<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.710> understood<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
we knew that understood that from the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
we knew that understood that from the
moment<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.629> started<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.229> design<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> product

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
moment we started to design the product

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.870 
moment we started to design the product
and<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.570> why<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.110> decided<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.130> make<00:01:08.549> sure

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and that is why we decided to make sure

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
and that is why we decided to make sure
not<00:01:09.390> only<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> selection<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
not only with the selection of the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
not only with the selection of the
material<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.720> nature<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.350> which

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
material but also the nature in which

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.859 
material but also the nature in which
the<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.250> sides<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> case<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.330> raised<00:01:15.570> up

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the the sides of the case are raised up

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.440 
the the sides of the case are raised up
that<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> glass<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.920> getting<00:01:17.310> maximum<00:01:18.299> in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that the glass is getting maximum in

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.960 
that the glass is getting maximum in
full<00:01:18.720> potential<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.770> better<00:01:20.640> experience

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
full potential a better experience

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.380 
full potential a better experience
through<00:01:21.570> good<00:01:21.840> design<00:01:22.430> doesn't<00:01:23.430> mean<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
through good design doesn't mean that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
through good design doesn't mean that
it's<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> better<00:01:25.590> experience<00:01:25.860> through

it's not a better experience through

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's not a better experience through
fast<00:01:26.460> design<00:01:26.759> right<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> better

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
fast design right it's a better

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.990 
fast design right it's a better
experience<00:01:28.680> through<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.430> design<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
experience through good design and I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.450 
experience through good design and I
think<00:01:30.030> naturally<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:31.110> rigorous<00:01:32.070> design

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
think naturally a rigorous design

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.510 
think naturally a rigorous design
process<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> take<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.340> bit

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
process is going to take a little bit

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.179 
process is going to take a little bit
more<00:01:35.759> time<00:01:35.970> than<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> rushed<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.979> one

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
more time than one that is rushed or one

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.490 
more time than one that is rushed or one
that<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.369> maybe

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
that is maybe

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.880 
that is maybe
or<00:01:39.590> capitalistic<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.580> nature<00:01:41.230> we<00:01:42.230> don't<00:01:42.470> want

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
or capitalistic in nature we don't want

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.960 
or capitalistic in nature we don't want
it<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.070> go<00:01:43.220> out<00:01:43.250> until<00:01:43.820> it's<00:01:43.940> right<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:45.970> that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
it to go out until it's right and that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.320 
it to go out until it's right and that
that<00:01:47.210> takes<00:01:47.510> time<00:01:47.720> about<00:01:48.110> only<00:01:48.320> time<00:01:48.650> and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
that takes time about only time and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.520 
that takes time about only time and
deciding<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:50.540> what<00:01:50.930> features<00:01:51.350> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
deciding what what features and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.930 
deciding what what features and
attributes<00:01:51.979> we<00:01:52.400> actually<00:01:52.700> want<00:01:52.850> to

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
attributes we actually want to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.130 
attributes we actually want to
incorporate<00:01:53.180> into<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.660> product<00:01:53.990> but

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
incorporate into the product but

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.100 
incorporate into the product but

actually physically designing them again

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.080 
actually physically designing them again
we<00:01:57.350> go<00:01:58.100> through<00:01:58.340> multiple<00:01:58.490> rounds<00:01:59.030> of

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
we go through multiple rounds of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.930
