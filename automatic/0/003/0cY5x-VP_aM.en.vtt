00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.290
 That is why Amsterdam Thursday evening voted recently stood in the spotlight 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.570
 after being in the Brabant club some sense of nonsense from their best side this one 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.010
 proceeds are cleared engineeringnet.be voted for the garden 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.010
 in which endured 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.880
 it has this year as you read and the chances were that it would break 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.190
 read on almost 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.300
 to load and unload and the buildings could choose between the vrt and the swimming pool 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.350
 I became a bomb there 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.380
 we must have come to life 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.640
 we are in the min with two containers and in the morning trade 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.429
 this was in his series, but it was true 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.939
 yesterday people looked at the Netherlands, the emphasis is too much on that 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.210
 coming soon 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.290
 so there are actually quite a few 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.800
 for us the concept in the demolition of the building is that in the red appearance 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800
 to have 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.390
 we must know that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230
 we don't want victims 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.240
 Meanwhile, things were going on 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.600
 The coach needs 70 million units to focus the attention of the options 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.579
 largely that is for the stronger plant one and think that most 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.260
 customers also temporarily paralyzed 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.190
 then why do they take the city then make a choice they tried anyway 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.700
 a bit to push but that plan anyway where one became strong enough 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 to create a focus on our stores 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.619
 the ad 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.619
 made the holiday atmosphere a bit of a lighter 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.240
 bit of a shame but this says the 39 years 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.780
 little holiday in the second half 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.780
 they are without power, it mainly concerns the barracks areas in oath in the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.260
 really works 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
 justice has been ordered 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:13.399
 Yes
