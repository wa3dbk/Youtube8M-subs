00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
aspects to the integrity that's needed

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.449 
aspects to the integrity that's needed
to<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:22.570> work<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.049> tattooing<00:03:23.470> feel

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
basically there's some of the fact that

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.660 
basically there's some of the fact that
you<00:03:28.660> are<00:03:28.690> macking<00:03:29.140> somebody<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.400> rest<00:03:30.580> of

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
you are macking somebody for the rest of

you are macking somebody for the rest of
their<00:03:30.820> life<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:32.640> they're<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.820> tattoos<00:03:34.380> were

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
their life and they're the tattoos were

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.930 
their life and they're the tattoos were
designed<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> bring<00:03:35.980> out<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.160> integrity<00:03:36.610> in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
designed to bring out that integrity in

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.460 
designed to bring out that integrity in
the<00:03:37.060> individual<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.690> that's<00:03:37.870> wearing<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.350> as

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
the individual and that's wearing it as

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.750 
the individual and that's wearing it as
well

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
well

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.550 
well
it's<00:03:40.480> kind<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.170> hard<00:03:41.350> thing<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
it's kind of it's a hard thing to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.620 
it's kind of it's a hard thing to
understand<00:03:42.100> until<00:03:42.820> you've<00:03:42.940> experienced<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
understand until you've experienced it

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.729 
understand until you've experienced it
basically<00:03:43.989> it's<00:03:44.140> one<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.350> those<00:03:44.440> sort<00:03:44.680> of

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
basically it's one of those sort of

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.259 
basically it's one of those sort of
things<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.100> does<00:03:48.280> have<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:49.120> effect

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
things and but it does have that effect

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.150 
things and but it does have that effect
on<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.110> tattoos<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.860> strong

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
on you that the tattoos have a strong

00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:15.290 
on you that the tattoos have a strong
effect<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:51.549> you

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.720 

you

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.350 

I<00:04:23.390> like<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.570> simplicity<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:26.040> black<00:04:26.220> ink

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
I like the simplicity of the black ink

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.630 
I like the simplicity of the black ink
and<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.740> fact<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:28.980> you're<00:04:29.160> working<00:04:29.310> with

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
and the fact that you're working with

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.940 
and the fact that you're working with
positive<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.690> negative<00:04:30.750> you've<00:04:31.290> got<00:04:31.470> the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
positive and negative you've got the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.440 
positive and negative you've got the
bits<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.280> are<00:04:32.400> better<00:04:32.670> filled<00:04:33.000> black<00:04:33.240> that

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
bits that are better filled black that

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.880 
bits that are better filled black that
are<00:04:33.600> black<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.350> bits<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.590> are<00:04:34.680> just

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
are black and the bits that are just

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.630 
are black and the bits that are just
clear<00:04:35.130> skin<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:36.470> with<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> lot<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.710> Polynesian

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
have line work which is almost like a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.110 
have line work which is almost like a
half<00:04:43.590> way<00:04:43.770> in<00:04:43.860> between<00:04:43.890> it's<00:04:44.280> like<00:04:44.430> from<00:04:45.030> a

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
half way in between it's like from a

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.850 
half way in between it's like from a
distance<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.540> becomes<00:04:45.840> like<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.080> grey<00:04:46.380> almost

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
distance it becomes like a grey almost

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.940 
distance it becomes like a grey almost
and<00:04:47.130> then<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:48.150> clear<00:04:48.360> skin<00:04:48.660> so<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.650> just<00:04:49.800> a

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
and then the clear skin so it's just a

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.620 
and then the clear skin so it's just a
simple<00:04:50.280> balance<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.880> positive<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:51.600> negative

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
simple balance of positive and negative

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.070 
simple balance of positive and negative
basically<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:53.150> of<00:04:54.150> all<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.480> colors<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
basically and of all the colors it's the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.510 
basically and of all the colors it's the
black<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.740> going<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.130> last<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.490> longest

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
black that is going to last the longest

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.340 
black that is going to last the longest
and<00:04:57.450> stay<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.200> truest<00:04:58.920> over<00:04:59.220> time<00:05:00.050> for<00:05:01.050> me<00:05:01.170> the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
and stay the truest over time for me the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.340 
and stay the truest over time for me the
pretty<00:05:02.010> much<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.250> hardest<00:05:02.670> thing<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.820> tattoo

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
pretty much the hardest thing to tattoo

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.300 
pretty much the hardest thing to tattoo
things<00:05:04.350> like<00:05:04.500> shall<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.680> away<00:05:04.890> from<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.190> most

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
things like shall I away from the most

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760 
things like shall I away from the most
as<00:05:05.520> long<00:05:05.730> straight<00:05:06.090> lines<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:07.260> me<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.380> find

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
as long straight lines for me I find

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.770 
as long straight lines for me I find
that<00:05:07.950> some<00:05:08.250> there's<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.330> hardest<00:05:09.600> thing<00:05:09.690> you

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
that some there's the hardest thing you

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.200 
that some there's the hardest thing you
get<00:05:09.900> right<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.320> if<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.530> don't<00:05:10.710> get<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.920> right

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
get right and if you don't get it right

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.750 
get right and if you don't get it right
it's<00:05:12.210> glaringly<00:05:12.510> obvious<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.670> there's<00:05:14.670> the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
it's glaringly obvious so there's the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:28.270 
it's glaringly obvious so there's the
thing<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.090> find<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.360> most<00:05:15.510> difficult

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.590 

basically<00:05:29.280> most<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.730> things<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.480> do

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
basically most of the things that I do

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.800 
basically most of the things that I do
nowadays<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.760> draw<00:05:32.760> directly<00:05:33.150> onto<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.540> skin

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
nowadays I draw directly onto the skin

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.020 
nowadays I draw directly onto the skin
there's<00:05:34.710> some<00:05:34.980> things<00:05:35.280> where<00:05:35.550> I<00:05:35.580> still<00:05:35.880> draw

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
there's some things where I still draw

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.200 
there's some things where I still draw
on<00:05:36.240> paper<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.900> that's<00:05:37.100> pieces<00:05:38.100> where<00:05:38.280> say

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
on paper and that's pieces where say

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.730 
on paper and that's pieces where say
someone<00:05:39.510> wants<00:05:39.690> to<00:05:39.720> represent<00:05:39.990> owns<00:05:40.470> a

the skin just getting a rough idea I
don't<00:06:01.230> think<00:06:01.410> about<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:01.740> too<00:06:01.920> much<00:06:01.950> before<00:06:02.250> I

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
don't think about it too much before I

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.120 
don't think about it too much before I
start<00:06:02.760> I<00:06:03.030> will<00:06:03.570> start<00:06:04.260> by<00:06:04.470> just<00:06:04.680> drawing<00:06:04.980> some

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
start I will start by just drawing some

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.310 
start I will start by just drawing some
some<00:06:05.880> lines<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.270> just<00:06:06.390> mapping<00:06:06.660> out<00:06:06.900> an<00:06:07.020> area

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
some lines and just mapping out an area

some lines and just mapping out an area
roughly<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:08.690> basically<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:09.810> try<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:10.230> just<00:06:10.320> let

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
roughly and basically I try and just let

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.560 
roughly and basically I try and just let
it<00:06:10.650> flow<00:06:10.860> and<00:06:11.130> do<00:06:11.550> its<00:06:11.700> own<00:06:11.820> thing<00:06:11.880> as<00:06:12.240> much<00:06:12.420> as
