00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
ways of doing it
Reggie<00:00:21.539> Miller<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> very<00:00:22.830> good<00:00:23.010> example<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
Reggie Miller is a very good example of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.220 
Reggie Miller is a very good example of
that<00:00:23.580> who<00:00:24.029> moves<00:00:24.330> without<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.840> best<00:00:25.019> one

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that who moves without the best one

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
that who moves without the best one
