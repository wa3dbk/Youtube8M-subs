00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
you so now the macbook line has been

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
you so now the macbook line has been
refreshed<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.220> redesign<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.150> anything

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
a core i3 processor clocked at 2.3

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
a core i3 processor clocked at 2.3
gigahertz<00:00:50.719> which<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> cool<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
gigahertz which is all which is cool you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.049 
gigahertz which is all which is cool you
know<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> end<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:55.340> giving<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.610> bigger<00:00:56.820> hard

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
know to end up giving you a bigger hard

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.619 
know to end up giving you a bigger hard
drive<00:00:57.120> too<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:59.329> separated<00:01:00.329> itself

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
drive too so it kind of separated itself

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
drive too so it kind of separated itself
now<00:01:00.899> completely<00:01:01.820> from<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.650> macbook<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
now completely from the macbook so the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
now completely from the macbook so the
white<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:05.960> completely<00:01:06.960> nobody<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.799> really

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
white one completely nobody can really

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.200 
white one completely nobody can really
compare<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> period<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:11.210> uncomfortable

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
compare it period now it's uncomfortable

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.240 
compare it period now it's uncomfortable
now<00:01:12.439> for<00:01:13.439> sure<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:15.030> some<00:01:15.450> Intel

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
now for sure and then it got some Intel

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.800 
now for sure and then it got some Intel
HD<00:01:17.250> graphics<00:01:18.200> 3000<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:20.000> but<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.600> now

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
HD graphics 3000 there but one thing now

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
HD graphics 3000 there but one thing now
though<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.650> battery<00:01:23.130> life<00:01:23.310> takes<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:24.150> hit<00:01:25.580> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
though the battery life takes a hit it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.480 
though the battery life takes a hit it
looks<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.000> they're<00:01:27.210> takes<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> hit<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.490> which

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
looks like they're takes a hit and which

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.200 
looks like they're takes a hit and which
seven<00:01:29.880> hours<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> still<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:31.970> it's<00:01:32.970> still

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
seven hours is still good it's still

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.190 
seven hours is still good it's still
good<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:36.930> we're<00:01:37.110> going

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
good so so I don't know when we're going

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.399 
good so so I don't know when we're going
to<00:01:37.290> begin<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.770> guys<00:01:38.420> where<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> work<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.049> so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to begin these guys where I work here so

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.010 
to begin these guys where I work here so
1<00:01:40.740> plus<00:01:40.770> we'll<00:01:41.280> probably<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.869> sell<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
1 plus we'll probably have to sell out

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
1 plus we'll probably have to sell out
of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> ones<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> prices

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of the ones that we have now the prices

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
of the ones that we have now the prices
on<00:01:45.030> those<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> drop<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:47.130> people<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
on those are going to drop so people are

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.330 
on those are going to drop so people are
still<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> buy<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.540> still<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:50.100> back

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
still going to buy them still get back

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.899 
still going to buy them still get back
only<00:01:51.210> pure<00:01:51.659> only<00:01:52.020> real<00:01:52.649> real<00:01:52.950> Apple<00:01:53.369> fans<00:01:53.579> will

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
only pure only real real Apple fans will

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.590 
only pure only real real Apple fans will
not<00:01:54.450> buy<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.560> cheaper<00:01:55.920> ones<00:01:56.070> anyway<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not buy the cheaper ones anyway the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.719 
not buy the cheaper ones anyway the
upgraded<00:01:58.049> version<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.560> will<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
upgraded version of that will have the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.370 
upgraded version of that will have the
core<00:02:00.229> i7<00:02:02.390> at<00:02:04.070> 2.7<00:02:05.070> gigahertz<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
core i7 at 2.7 gigahertz on that and I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
core i7 at 2.7 gigahertz on that and I
think<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.360> Sandy

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
think it's the these are the Sandy

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.170 
think it's the these are the Sandy
Bridge<00:02:09.869> processors<00:02:10.140> I'd<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.129> check<00:02:11.160> here

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
Bridge processors I'd have to check here

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.270 
Bridge processors I'd have to check here
to<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.799> i7<00:02:15.659> will<00:02:16.659> have<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.079> designer<00:02:18.010> greater

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to the i7 will have the designer greater

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.140 
to the i7 will have the designer greater

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.099

upgrade<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.849> still<00:02:37.389> got<00:02:37.540> your<00:02:37.659> four<00:02:37.870> gigs

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
upgrade you still got your four gigs

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.039 
upgrade you still got your four gigs

this<00:02:42.040> one<00:02:42.280> um<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:44.139> you<00:02:44.379> got<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.829> same

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
this one um and then you got the same

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.649 
this one um and then you got the same
until<00:02:45.629> HD<00:02:46.629> 3000<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.470> fix<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.189> and<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:49.389> seven

card which I didn't see more people go

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.249 
card which I didn't see more people go
for<00:03:54.849> this<00:03:55.599> than<00:03:55.900> anything<00:03:56.019> really<00:03:56.680> um<00:03:58.259> that's

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
for this than anything really um that's

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:04.229 
for this than anything really um that's
what<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.500> can<00:03:59.709> see<00:03:59.949> I<00:04:00.099> remember<00:04:00.609> there<00:04:00.790> was<00:04:03.239> um

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
what I can see I remember there was um

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.479 
what I can see I remember there was um
there<00:04:04.750> was<00:04:04.840> three<00:04:05.109> versions<00:04:05.349> of<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.859> and<00:04:06.250> we

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
there was three versions of this and we

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.879 
there was three versions of this and we
always<00:04:06.639> sell<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.239> highest<00:04:07.509> one<00:04:07.900> more<00:04:08.349> than

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
always sell the highest one more than

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.809 
always sell the highest one more than
the<00:04:09.310> most<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.900> now<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.139> x1<00:04:11.949> and<00:04:12.280> now<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.790> just

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
the most so now the x1 and now it just

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.240 
the most so now the x1 and now it just
out<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.329> so<00:04:13.629> people<00:04:13.959> will<00:04:14.109> most<00:04:14.769> likely<00:04:15.009> get

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
out to so people will most likely get

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.170 
out to so people will most likely get
this<00:04:15.459> one<00:04:15.639> here<00:04:17.009> and<00:04:18.009> then<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.220> 17<00:04:18.759> inch<00:04:18.880> which

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
this one here and then a 17 inch which

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.560 
this one here and then a 17 inch which
we<00:04:19.449> never<00:04:19.780> soon<00:04:20.370> but<00:04:21.370> rarely<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.719> yeah<00:04:23.680> it's

we never soon but rarely but yeah it's

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.809 
we never soon but rarely but yeah it's
it's<00:04:25.570> more<00:04:25.840> expensive<00:04:26.050> now

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
it's more expensive now

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.879

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
yeah it's this one is more expensive I

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:30.960 
yeah it's this one is more expensive I
don't<00:04:30.100> even<00:04:30.220> know<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.430> we're<00:04:30.550> going<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.729> carry

this because we Denver carried the the
i7<00:04:34.780> 17<00:04:35.169> inch<00:04:35.740> so<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.669> know<00:04:36.789> I<00:04:36.819> don't<00:04:37.060> know<00:04:37.300> if
