son<00:00:11.980> again<00:00:12.190> the<00:00:12.280> bricks<00:00:12.519> to<00:00:12.700> soak<00:00:12.910> up<00:00:13.120> some

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
son again the bricks to soak up some

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.240 
son again the bricks to soak up some
heat<00:00:13.420> first<00:00:13.809> the<00:00:14.349> tricky<00:00:14.680> thing<00:00:14.920> doing<00:00:15.190> it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
heat first the tricky thing doing it

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.950 
heat first the tricky thing doing it
with<00:00:15.340> a<00:00:15.429> torch<00:00:15.639> is<00:00:16.180> to<00:00:16.330> make<00:00:16.480> sure<00:00:16.689> I<00:00:16.720> don't

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
with a torch is to make sure I don't

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.320 
with a torch is to make sure I don't
overheat<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.890> thin<00:00:18.160> sections<00:00:18.790> either<00:00:19.119> side

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
overheat the thin sections either side

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.300 
overheat the thin sections either side
of<00:00:19.360> that<00:00:19.509> hole<00:00:19.869> I<00:00:20.230> want<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.740> environments

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
of that hole I want the environments

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.540 
of that hole I want the environments
it's<00:00:21.430> been<00:00:21.669> in<00:00:21.849> to<00:00:22.029> be<00:00:22.119> nice<00:00:22.329> and<00:00:22.570> hot<00:00:23.110> anyway

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:38.290 

until<00:00:26.150> nice<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:26.630> even

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:01:03.290 

might<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.450> worked<00:01:01.850> conducts<00:01:02.850> heat<00:01:03.030> really

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
might have worked conducts heat really

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
might have worked conducts heat really
well<00:01:03.420> than<00:01:03.780> brush<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:05.040> people<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.880> uniformly

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
well than brush so people be uniformly

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.620 
well than brush so people be uniformly
conveyed<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.800> this<00:01:08.119> then<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.210> won't<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
conveyed on to this then I won't have to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
conveyed on to this then I won't have to
compete<00:01:09.960> visually<00:01:10.410> with<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> effect<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
compete visually with the effect of the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.080 
compete visually with the effect of the
flame<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.149> color<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> steel<00:01:14.090> its

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
flame to see what color the steel its

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.639 
flame to see what color the steel its
stainless<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.899> chrome<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.410> bits<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
stainless it's got chrome and bits a

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.469 
stainless it's got chrome and bits a
nickel<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> doesn't<00:01:17.790> perform<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
nickel in it so it doesn't perform a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.010 
nickel in it so it doesn't perform a
colored<00:01:19.229> oxide<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.800> readily<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.190> normal<00:01:20.640> steel

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
colored oxide as readily as normal steel

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.150 
colored oxide as readily as normal steel
so<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> cause<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.560> looking<00:01:22.800> for<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
so the cause I'm looking for a little

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.690 
so the cause I'm looking for a little
bit<00:01:23.369> harder<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> pickle<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:26.160> do<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> properly

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
bit harder to pickle to do this properly

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
bit harder to pickle to do this properly
for<00:01:27.060> stainless<00:01:27.300> you<00:01:27.600> need<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.899> soak<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
for stainless you need to soak it the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
for stainless you need to soak it the
tempering<00:01:29.369> temperature<00:01:31.100> yeah<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> period

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
tempering temperature yeah for a period

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.420 
tempering temperature yeah for a period
of<00:01:33.000> time<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.310> right

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
of time we don't really have the right

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.810 
of time we don't really have the right
to<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.149> that<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.570> could<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.110> gas<00:01:37.820> gas

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to do that you could do in a gas gas

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.529 
to do that you could do in a gas gas
oven

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.440 

pale<00:01:42.539> Brown<00:01:42.950> developing<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> little

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
pale Brown developing and go a little

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.630 
pale Brown developing and go a little
bit<00:01:45.690> further<00:01:45.929> than<00:01:46.289> that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.800 

well<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:54.030> only<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.479> bothered<00:01:54.750> about

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
well I'm only really bothered about

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.590 
well I'm only really bothered about
where<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> holes<00:01:55.469> are<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.210> needs<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
where the holes are but there needs to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:09.219 
where the holes are but there needs to
be<00:01:57.719> considered<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.439> well

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:21.520 

well<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:11.990> just<00:02:12.990> leave<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.140 

it's<00:02:22.530> nice<00:02:22.800> sometimes<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.730> wet<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> was

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it's nice sometimes when it's wet I was

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.520 
it's nice sometimes when it's wet I was
gonna<00:02:24.239> film<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.599> grease<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.379> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
gonna film with grease you can see the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.660 
gonna film with grease you can see the
color<00:02:25.739> better

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.060 

you<00:02:29.670> might<00:02:29.849> work
