00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.669
 there begins a series of cameras that faces Peter's market 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.620
 this aunt agrees to be good quality tyson rubber teams 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.329
 sufficient to ensure safety in the footprint 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.660
 the census has just over 10 megapixels he explains that this is a divided into 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.710
 six times and mechanical stabilization edict 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.669
 she even made almost mark with even a feeling of hopelessness 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.889
 the thesis finds in more advanced zones, India only shows an automatic 

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:33.160
 of the scenes and other companies like that I had up to 120 more at high speed 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 the thesis recorded and out of consumption debut with a very good quality for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.330
 eat this category 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.220
 it has an hdmi output but it did not put the loop on it is common for the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.680
 frescoes are indicated 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.910
 I'm from the bento but the automatic is also here 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.600
 smart that you choose between some scenes with the best 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.200
 I would not say that it's a year to always be used on the date who wants to start 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.960
 understand more photos 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.409
 later big decent slap that was the battery I opened the box I go there 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.850
 I get that little square of charging the battery missing violent box there 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.430
 that I see you have to pick up the camera itself if you put 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.869
 again to load the nape team appears and leaves his camera in the corner 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.970
 of the wall also a teacher who teaches each month 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.310
 we learned that real-time deforestation 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.700
 that in a rigid and translated 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730
 but here she does herself 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.440
 still worried if there is going to be something missing that is not 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.390
 want to see 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 receive these messages today and I very much believe in merit and says 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 so masculine that it gives a fear of you breaks it here 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.570
 these are three abstentions 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.200
 but so much difference so fifa still does not know if having an idea served 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.869
 also in addition to being an opinion an area earlier it 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.869
 he only wants only those who have exceptions and not 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.320
 You still have to have some coffee in the world. 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.920
 and also not speaking quickly said 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.489
 her 7-year focus being clicked autochthonous work button demands the task was 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.209
 very fast 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.480
 line and this was the third placed
