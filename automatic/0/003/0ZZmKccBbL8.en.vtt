00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.950
 Hi, I'm Chinese, crazy, today I bring you the skulls that are easiest and most practical. 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.089
 of halo 2 and above a mystery of halo 2 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.449
 ok let's start with the skulls the first one is my favorite 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.489
 even in such a double the damage of the grenades and the blows very convenient 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:22.019
 for the grenade jumps they must go to the quarantine mission in legendary and 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 do what is shown in the video 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.899
 Clear 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.780
 will cut everything 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.400
 the second change is in the outskirts 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.700
 its effect is that when you finish one level and follow another you start with the weapons of the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.850
 previous level but this only happens in certain worlds not in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 anyone or with any weapon 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.400
 time plays 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.330
 we will be at all 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
 in third place is all 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.129
 when removing from here they must maintain a principle 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.129
 to be able to grab the skull 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.039
 photo ap 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.039
 with 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.999
 the green party 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.060
 so that the next one 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.430
 they must reboot the level ohno the effect will go out is not let see the gun looks the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.960
 ammunition the grenades the radar and deactivates the lamp although of all 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.110
 forms are there I find it very useful if you want to take a picture of a landscape 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.110
 without being disturbed by anything or to make some video 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.089
 the old man may be 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.009
 both countries added 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.009
 remember that the ship is going down 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:35.589
 that 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.489
 little by little I go 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.769
 but that she has nothing 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.999
 / arc 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.239
 and here are the mysteries 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.639
 the first comes out in the world gravy mind only in legendary pay attention 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.639
 it comes out in the second video 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.809
 If you did not see it, well, I put it to make it look better 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.300
 ace 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.949
 forgive the fucking quality 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.949
 but it's the same weird figure of a guy in halo 3 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.139
 and on top of both 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.229
 not there goes another mystery this one I found it myself is a soldier 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.229
 hidden at the end of the first world come out any difficulty 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.369
 Guided and Sara 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.199
 until the next this will be the last video of halo mysteries 2 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.659

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.930
 video until next time
