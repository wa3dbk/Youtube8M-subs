00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:12.433
Round and round.  Round and round.
Round and round.  Round and round.

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:32.370
Just I am looking at you.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.860
(pit-a-pat  pit-a-pat)

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.503
Just I am reading your face.

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.053
(flickering flickering)

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:52.332
Two of us are always 
not too close nor not too far.

00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:58.734
Standing at the corner making us
to miss each other,

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:04.129
our hearts are getting soaked.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.277
What should we do? 
Our meeting is going round and round.

00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:13.980
In the time flowing rapidly, 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.499
I am afraid that relationship of us 
liking each other will fade away.

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:25.778

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.368
(pit-a-pat  pit-a-pat)

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:58.824
Just I am worrying myself.

00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:00.564
(glancing glancing)

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:12.643
Two of us are always 
not too close nor not too far.

00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:19.136
Standing at the corner making us
to miss each other,

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:24.615
our hearts are getting soaked.

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:30.767
What should we do? 
Our meeting is going round and round.

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:34.441
In the time flowing rapidly, 

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:40.000
I am afraid that relationship of us 
liking each other will fade away.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.194
What should we do? 
Our meeting is going round and round.

00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:49.717
In the time flowing rapidly, 

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:55.388
I am afraid that relationship of us 
liking each other will fade away.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:03:01.721
What should we do? 
Our meeting is going round and round.

00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.228
In the time flowing rapidly, 

00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:11.778
I am afraid that relationship of us 
liking each other will fade away.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:30.322
Round and round.  Round and round.
Round and round.  Round and round.
