colorants things are back to the days of
the<00:01:38.430> 90s<00:01:42.170> apparently<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.829> SATA<00:01:44.159> cable

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the 90s apparently we have a SATA cable

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560 
the 90s apparently we have a SATA cable
that's<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that's it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
that's it
one<00:01:45.750> SATA<00:01:45.990> cable<00:01:46.380> no<00:01:46.590> -<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> right<00:01:47.460> angle<00:01:47.759> on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
one SATA cable no - got a right angle on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
one SATA cable no - got a right angle on
never<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> dingo<00:01:49.020> SATA<00:01:49.409> cable<00:01:49.740> before

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
never out of a dingo SATA cable before

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.370 
never out of a dingo SATA cable before
so<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:50.729> driver<00:01:51.540> disc<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.049> wish

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so that's the first driver disc I wish

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
so that's the first driver disc I wish
they'd<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.560> give<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.250> USB<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.820> even

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
they'd just give you like a USB or even

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
they'd just give you like a USB or even
better<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> download<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:56.700> really

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
better just a download but that's really

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.789

let's install this thing fairly easy
that's<00:02:43.140> probably<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.500> ton<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.799> videos<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that's probably a ton of videos on the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.199 
that's probably a ton of videos on the
net<00:02:44.760> exactly<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> open<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.640> do<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.000> but

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
net exactly to open this and do this but

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.750 
net exactly to open this and do this but
you<00:02:48.360> know<00:02:48.450> here's<00:02:48.690> mine

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
you know here's mine

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.080 
you know here's mine
how<00:02:50.760> do<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.940> open<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.269> CPU<00:02:51.660> cases<00:02:52.019> yeah<00:02:52.470> I

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
how do you open the CPU cases yeah I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.520 
how do you open the CPU cases yeah I
guess<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.269> only<00:02:54.390> real<00:02:54.690> thing<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.260> worried

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
guess the only real thing to be worried

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.350 
guess the only real thing to be worried
about<00:02:55.560> make<00:02:55.920> sure<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.280> line<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.640> up<00:02:59.269> used<00:03:00.269> to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
about make sure you line this up used to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.940 
about make sure you line this up used to
little<00:03:00.569> things<00:03:00.660> they<00:03:01.049> gotta<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.410> lined<00:03:01.799> up

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
little things they gotta be lined up

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.520 
little things they gotta be lined up
right<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.660> should<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:03.989> fit<00:03:04.349> back

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
right here and it should just fit back

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.330 
right here and it should just fit back
in<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.280> thing<00:03:05.549> should<00:03:05.790> pop<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.980> no<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
in and this thing should pop out no I

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
injustice so here I am installing Ram

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.520 
injustice so here I am installing Ram
really<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.790> would<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.420> dual<00:03:27.660> channel<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.290> stuff

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
really I would do dual channel and stuff

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.849 
really I would do dual channel and stuff
but<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.760> doesn't<00:03:30.150> matter<00:03:30.390> cuz<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.590> three

to<00:03:46.920> install<00:03:47.069> it's<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.639> CPU<00:03:48.150> cooler<00:03:48.359> I'm<00:03:48.750> using

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
to install it's the CPU cooler I'm using

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.470 
to install it's the CPU cooler I'm using
a<00:03:49.200> stock<00:03:49.440> cooler<00:03:49.739> right<00:03:49.980> now<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.549> cuz<00:03:50.880> it

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
a stock cooler right now just cuz it

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.800 
a stock cooler right now just cuz it
works<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:53.310> really<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:54.060> need<00:03:54.239> any<00:03:54.299> extra

works and I really don't need any extra

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.140 
works and I really don't need any extra
performance<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.040> cooling<00:03:56.340> especially<00:03:56.970> since

I can't overclock these chips

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:06.740 
I can't overclock these chips
essentially<00:04:00.209> I'll<00:04:00.600> set<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:00.989> up<00:04:01.200> oh<00:04:04.400> my<00:04:05.750> gosh

thank<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.780> there<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.810> go<00:04:17.930> that's<00:04:18.230> plugged<00:04:18.530> in

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
thank you there you go that's plugged in

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.130 
thank you there you go that's plugged in
that's<00:04:19.040> good<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.660> guess<00:04:20.660> there's<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:20.989> much

more<00:04:21.350> on<00:04:21.410> this<00:04:21.500> boy<00:04:21.739> don't<00:04:22.130> look<00:04:22.250> right

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
more on this boy don't look right

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.370 
more on this boy don't look right
it<00:04:22.880> was<00:04:22.970> my<00:04:23.090> basic<00:04:23.270> little<00:04:23.750> test<00:04:23.990> bench<00:04:24.200> right

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
it was my basic little test bench right

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.900 
it was my basic little test bench right
you<00:04:24.470> know<00:04:24.560> got<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.950> CPU<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:25.580> here<00:04:26.260> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
you know got the CPU in here the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.370 
you know got the CPU in here the
graphics<00:04:28.910> card<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.390> my<00:04:29.540> monitors<00:04:30.080> and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
graphics card and my monitors and

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.100 
graphics card and my monitors and
everything<00:04:30.800> should<00:04:31.100> just<00:04:31.130> boot<00:04:31.460> up<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.700> work

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
everything should just boot up and work

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.690 
everything should just boot up and work
I'm<00:04:33.110> gonna<00:04:33.260> go<00:04:33.410> plug<00:04:33.620> in<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:33.950> hard<00:04:34.190> drive<00:04:34.340> to

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
I'm gonna go plug in this hard drive to

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.240 
I'm gonna go plug in this hard drive to
this<00:04:34.790> slot<00:04:35.090> right<00:04:35.300> here<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.590> using<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
this slot right here this is using the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.640 
this slot right here this is using the
b85<00:04:38.000> chipset<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:38.570> there's<00:04:38.840> only<00:04:38.960> two<00:04:39.290> four

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
b85 chipset so there's only two four

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.610 
b85 chipset so there's only two four
SATA<00:04:40.010> six<00:04:40.370> connectors<00:04:41.050> which<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.170> more<00:04:42.380> than

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
SATA six connectors which is more than

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.260 
SATA six connectors which is more than
enough<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:43.340> anything<00:04:43.670> I<00:04:43.760> can<00:04:43.940> do

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
enough for anything I can do

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.530 
enough for anything I can do
flipping<00:04:45.080> on<00:04:45.230> that<00:04:45.410> power<00:04:45.650> supply<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:47.150> let's

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
flipping on that power supply and let's

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.230 
flipping on that power supply and let's
short<00:04:47.840> out<00:04:47.990> these<00:04:48.200> pins<00:04:48.620> hopefully<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.730> songs

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
short out these pins hopefully the songs

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.380 
short out these pins hopefully the songs
there<00:04:53.240> go<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:54.470> little<00:04:54.620> green<00:04:54.830> LEDs<00:04:55.250> on<00:04:55.430> here<00:04:56.360> I

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
there go a little green LEDs on here I

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.180 
there go a little green LEDs on here I
am<00:04:56.570> powering<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.170> on<00:04:57.290> for<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.710> second<00:04:58.250> time

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
am powering it on for the second time

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.740 
am powering it on for the second time
because<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.580> first<00:05:01.850> time<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.240> did<00:05:02.540> it<00:05:02.570> I

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
because it's the first time I did it I

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.410 
because it's the first time I did it I
didn't<00:05:02.930> plug<00:05:03.080> in<00:05:03.200> my<00:05:03.260> graphics<00:05:03.680> card<00:05:04.330> just<00:05:05.330> a

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
didn't plug in my graphics card just a

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.460 
didn't plug in my graphics card just a
little<00:05:05.600> six<00:05:05.840> pin<00:05:06.400> yeah<00:05:07.900> no<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:08.930> just<00:05:09.080> turned<00:05:09.380> on

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
little six pin yeah no I just turned on

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.290 
little six pin yeah no I just turned on
my<00:05:09.560> power<00:05:09.770> supply<00:05:09.980> yeah<00:05:10.430> I'm<00:05:10.580> making<00:05:10.760> mistakes

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
my power supply yeah I'm making mistakes

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.330 
my power supply yeah I'm making mistakes
like<00:05:11.420> there's<00:05:11.720> nobody's<00:05:12.170> business<00:05:12.380> there<00:05:13.280> you

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
go now those fans are spinning CPU a

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.270 
go now those fans are spinning CPU a
little<00:05:16.190> Intel<00:05:16.490> fan<00:05:16.760> does<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.090> thing

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
little Intel fan does that thing

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.410 
little Intel fan does that thing
hopefully<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.400> monitors<00:05:19.760> yep<00:05:19.940> they<00:05:20.210> say

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
hopefully the monitors yep they say

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.320 
boot and hope it gets because I have a
driver<00:05:25.100> for<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.370> next<00:05:25.580> plugged<00:05:25.820> in<00:05:25.970> let's

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
driver for the next plugged in let's

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.090 
driver for the next plugged in let's
just<00:05:26.660> hope<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:26.960> does<00:05:27.140> it<00:05:27.290> well<00:05:27.800> find<00:05:28.010> out
