00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.989

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.520
 Hello from Kassel, his new video comes with the most energy 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.419
 To the racing program Essener what the use of the Mac app should look like 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.789
 then already out that the price is not more 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.500
 um and yes the function is quite simple it is that we are following our program 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.370
 playing around in the gut with keyboard shortcuts 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.860
 The mac-user is showing the call center to fit a damn lot of combination 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.060
 move on the Mac that is the man come exaggerated now too 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.210
 already exaggerated clock flow easy 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.280
 um and you get used to all this and it will not be rewarded said 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.420
 van Essen ten stage wins here this little icons around that are two very 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 that everybody knows and then this symbol comes up in the bar and then 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.140
 Can you then the attitude to the Egyptians also not much to do all 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.370
 these questions attitude among other things therefore at the start to the Ex 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.610
 should also start then you can set the scene for the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.350
 different programs here and she started doing the action herself in principle 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.290
 but there are so set that it is not easy next to the fine noses 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.950
 all get numbered 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.300
 Of course, you have to remember about them all the same 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.960
 you want it but maybe we'll say it now in the mac app store 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 States clearly makes Komatsu 2 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.930
 because he was next to Melis and then he started or I now want to go as boys 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.720
 through Home and Dry then comes as guys in me the topic already Kommern 4 and 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.640
 as far as which again time into a coma three now I would like but again to trouble 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.280
 drew at 1 2 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.799
 and that's how easy it is to have more around everyone, so to speak 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.200
 Computer everyday just so through the programs to Sculpture so I find it 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.359
 actually quite nice of 90 cents you can not go wrong 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.810
 percent 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.420
 because of that and not so much videos but you can also normal 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.080
 think private Jena will come to see it also in the description Dabbashi 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.750

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.249
 The schools
