00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
you get about six grams which is 0.21

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
mean in my mirror it looks kind of like

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
mean in my mirror it looks kind of like
my<00:03:33.110> skin's<00:03:33.410> matte<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.459> little<00:03:34.700> bit<00:03:34.819> even

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
my skin's matte and a little bit even

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:45.910 
my skin's matte and a little bit even
down<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:37.280> coverage<00:03:37.790> wise<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:45.709> don't

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
down but coverage wise I just don't

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.150

is much better as a treatment foundation
you<00:03:55.160> know<00:03:55.280> treatment<00:03:55.790> underneath<00:03:56.209> foundation

thought it would have a bit more
coverage<00:06:07.760> and<00:06:08.120> not<00:06:09.110> only<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:09.410> a<00:06:09.620> bit<00:06:09.920> more

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
but I think we'll all agree that it's a

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.620 
but I think we'll all agree that it's a
bit<00:07:20.120> on<00:07:20.390> the<00:07:20.630> shiny<00:07:20.930> side<00:07:21.290> I<00:07:22.330> actually<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.480> mean

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
bit on the shiny side I actually I mean

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.940 
bit on the shiny side I actually I mean
it<00:07:23.750> feels<00:07:23.870> like<00:07:23.990> I'm<00:07:24.170> not<00:07:24.380> wearing<00:07:24.770> anything

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950 
it feels like I'm not wearing anything

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:32.530 
it feels like I'm not wearing anything
but<00:07:25.610> I<00:07:28.060> don't<00:07:29.060> know<00:07:29.500> anyway<00:07:31.060> it's<00:07:32.060> not<00:07:32.240> claim

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 
but I don't know anyway it's not claim

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.270 
but I don't know anyway it's not claim
it's<00:07:32.780> not<00:07:32.840> claimed<00:07:33.260> to<00:07:33.830> be<00:07:33.980> a<00:07:34.010> long-lasting

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 
it's not claimed to be a long-lasting

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.100 
it's not claimed to be a long-lasting
foundation<00:07:35.240> but<00:07:37.690> yeah<00:07:39.100> ok
