00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.500
 where at 8 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.460
 had separated from the charge by simply 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.320
 cut my little hair to the interns 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.570
 a measure that rather had other 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.019
 purposes that is to say there were internal ones that 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.269
 they escaped 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.220
 supported helped by his long hair he 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.879
 will disguise as women will be one of 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.879
 the reasons why the rules 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.129
 are the rules of the Corten steel criminal 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.070
 all those kinds of things that more then 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.830
 it would be that the military does not 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.570
 commands tried or processed 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.010
 expensive paradiso because they take the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.159
 hair to his subordinates in short let's go with 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.830
 melisa movers information to her is 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.910
 12 minutes with Colonel Garay and he's 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.920
 your interview 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 every day companions after the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
 controversial deposition of Colonel Tomás 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.670
 staff and management of prison 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.979
 lurigancho the national police has 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.750
 willing to replace him in his position what 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.760
 determine that there was not a 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.440
 administrative responsibility in the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 haircuts to the rapier of the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.220
 inmates we are going to talk justly 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 with Colonel Garay very good morning 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 colonel the first impression with this 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.160
 replacement 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 we continue continuing with the activities 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.080
 programmed already established in the plan 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.380
 of work today as this one in 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.860
 a ceremony that is already contemplated 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.320
 by the staff that is in charge of the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.340
 of the regular basic education center that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.910
 it's here in this center 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.830
 penitentiary as the beginning then to 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.619
 activities for the patriotic month that's why 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.690
 is that throughout our criminal amaneció 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.010
 with white flags and the flag of 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.050
 Peruvian as it is 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.670
 as I start then to this holiday 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.290
 patriotic that is celebrated all the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.480
 months of July do not feel 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.000
 counted with the majority support of the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.100
 resources of the criminal of lurigancho the most 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.350
 committed to continue on the same line 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.530
 in the same order and do a job 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.000
 because I think the commitment of all the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.240
 National police command is to make 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.540
 an efficient and transparent work to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.260
 so that way support what 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 is the order of discipline and this what 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.190
 is this contribute to safety 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.710
 citizen because there was a lot of talk about 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.450
 this criminal can that 90 percent of 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.820
 the extortionist calls came from 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.620
 this viral then we are 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.320
 attacking frontally that subject and the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.850
 have understood it this way that here 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.100
 you have to abide by the rules 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.290
 provisions and in that we are all 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.200
 committed to doing the main 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 axes in his management from now on 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.299
 good to keep 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.730
 a transparent administration 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:00.560
 from many of many orders a lot 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.269
 discipline of preventing bad from 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.700
 people who are inside 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.930
 try to take advantage of what I'm going 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.720
 to appropriate the products that you 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 correspond to the inmates as they are 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.470
 food at the time of 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.939
 any emergency in the health area 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.439
 also in giving you what is 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:20.079
 penitentiary benefits and also 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.730
 an evaluation has already been made 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.139
 We have more than 200 freezers in the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.090
 inside the prison that is given term 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.250
 until July 15 so they can 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 remove this freezer in colonial sea 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.569
 like these controversial haircuts 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.430
 to the snuff but I see you and I watched the cut 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.739
 that there was a number three in the number 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.569
 three a collegiate cut is not even 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.370
 military but that will allow me 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.919
 as responsible for the administration and 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.480
 security of this penal establishment 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.129
 to avoid any this escape attempt 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.220
 that they would like to do because there 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.040
 understand that one day Wednesday and 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.659
 the days I receive 15 thousand people who 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.640
 they are inside the prison they are not 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.500
 eight thousand inmates plus seven thousand visits 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.120
 the shortage of our staff the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.730
 limitation of our police personnel 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.440
 makes us redouble our efforts and 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.770
 I think that as far as we see 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.330
 the area restricted to this person 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.680
 Well, with the hair trimmed if I do not say 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.209
 that is an internal what is going to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.250
 allow is to neutralize any leak 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.919
 to the parquet on the margin of agreement 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.320
 to article 5 of the criminal action code and 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.030
 Article 76 talks about that in everything 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.190
 at the moment the intern then of matter the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.570
 order discipline and finally clean 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.070
