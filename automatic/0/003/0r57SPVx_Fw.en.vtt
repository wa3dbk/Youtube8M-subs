the<00:00:15.269> most<00:00:15.360> useful<00:00:15.780> Cydia<00:00:16.320> tweaks<00:00:16.680> ever

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the most useful Cydia tweaks ever

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.580

because many of you know that the auto

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.410 
because many of you know that the auto
correction<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.279> Apple<00:00:20.580> implements<00:00:21.180> into

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
correction that Apple implements into

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.380 
correction that Apple implements into
their<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> devices<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.760> really<00:00:23.760> really

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
their I devices is really really

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.509 
their I devices is really really
annoying<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.140> say<00:00:25.920> you're<00:00:26.099> typing<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> message

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
annoying so say you're typing a message

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.050 
annoying so say you're typing a message
and<00:00:27.180> auto<00:00:27.990> correction<00:00:28.650> kicks<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and auto correction kicks in and it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
and auto correction kicks in and it
changes<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.750> word<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.500> were<00:00:31.619> intending

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
instead of auto correct just kicking in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100 
instead of auto correct just kicking in
and<00:00:44.460> change<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> word<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> against<00:00:45.989> your

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
word so let me go ahead and demonstrate

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
word so let me go ahead and demonstrate
i'll<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.559> notes<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.239> let's<00:00:54.390> open<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
i'll go into notes and let's open up a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
i'll go into notes and let's open up a
new<00:00:54.780> note<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> i'm<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> misspell

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
new note here and i'm going to misspell

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
new note here and i'm going to misspell
point<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.960> p<00:00:58.230> 0<00:00:58.699> UNT<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.039> right

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
point so p 0 UNT and you can see right

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.759 
point so p 0 UNT and you can see right
there<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:03.000> has<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.600> actual<00:01:03.840> spelling

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
there that it has the actual spelling

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.300 
there that it has the actual spelling
for<00:01:05.010> point<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> usually<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.860> i<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.130> press

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
for point and so usually if i just press

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.690 
for point and so usually if i just press
space<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.390> automatically<00:01:09.930> change<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
space it would automatically change that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
space it would automatically change that
incorrect<00:01:11.700> word<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.180> point<00:01:12.470> spud<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.220> i

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
incorrect word to point spud now all i

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
incorrect word to point spud now all i
need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.119> press<00:01:15.299> space<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:17.159> puts<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
need to do is press space and it puts a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
need to do is press space and it puts a
little<00:01:17.640> red<00:01:17.939> line<00:01:18.659> underneath<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.409> i<00:01:19.470> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
little red line underneath it so i can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
little red line underneath it so i can
just<00:01:19.770> tap<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> i<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.509> options

here<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.710> i<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.280> ahead<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.460> tap

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
here and i can just go ahead and tap

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
here and i can just go ahead and tap
point<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.009> do

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
point right there and you can also do

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.850 
point right there and you can also do
the<00:01:26.250> same<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.909> i'll<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.840> retype<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> again

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
the same for i'll just retype it again

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.800 
the same for i'll just retype it again
you<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.010> just<00:01:31.130> type<00:01:31.340> tap<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.090> as<00:01:32.360> usual

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
you can just type tap that as usual

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.260 
you can just type tap that as usual
instead<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.320> having<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.650> tap<00:01:34.190> that<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.700> cancel

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
instead of having to tap that to cancel

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.780 
instead of having to tap that to cancel
the<00:01:35.810> autocorrect<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.800> again<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:37.640> is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
the autocorrect so again this is

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.219 
the autocorrect so again this is
probably<00:01:37.970> one<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.360> most<00:01:38.479> useful<00:01:38.870> tweaks

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
probably one of the most useful tweaks

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.490 
probably one of the most useful tweaks
