this thing it's a bit iffy but it can be

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.280 
this thing it's a bit iffy but it can be
fixed

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
fixed

fixed
I'm<00:03:09.470> going<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.800> have<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> go<00:03:10.070> at<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.250> at<00:03:10.370> some

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
I'm going to have a go at it at some

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.330 
I'm going to have a go at it at some
point<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:12.140> you'll<00:03:12.290> see<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.560> how<00:03:12.799> fast<00:03:13.130> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
point and you'll see just how fast the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.400 
point and you'll see just how fast the
weight<00:03:13.519> drops<00:03:15.040> next<00:03:16.040> few<00:03:16.340> minutes<00:03:17.799> you'll<00:03:18.799> see

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
weight drops next few minutes you'll see

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.670 
weight drops next few minutes you'll see
look<00:03:21.410> at<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> artist<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.250> artistry<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.000> that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
look at the artist of artistry of that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.729 
look at the artist of artistry of that
in<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.920> cool<00:03:25.160> clock<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:32.709> kind<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
in that a cool clock I think so kind of

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.500 
in that a cool clock I think so kind of
get<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> straight<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.000> can<00:03:35.150> see<00:03:35.420> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
get it straight so you can see it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:46.970 
get it straight so you can see it
properly<00:03:39.730> love<00:03:40.730> it

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.560 

there<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.960> marching<00:03:49.960> onwards<00:03:51.150> get<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> 12

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
there it is marching onwards get a 12

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:01.890 
there it is marching onwards get a 12
p.m.<00:03:59.760> got<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.820> couple<00:04:01.000> more<00:04:01.180> videos<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.660> put<00:04:01.780> up
