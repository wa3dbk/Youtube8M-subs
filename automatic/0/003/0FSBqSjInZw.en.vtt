00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:23.080
 profane good evening to all 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.080
 I believe that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.360
 always 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.870
 I'm talking about having the next game 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:40.760
 as an opportunity to improve 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.760
 I think tonight compared to one 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.930
 excellent race 3 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 the school is still outdated 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.700
 it was an even more difficult game to play 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.420
 a point of view 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.780
 mental milan played a great one 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.030
 match and having it won means that the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:09.810
 team knew he had the pleasure of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 outdo yourself once again 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
 sorry I don't understand why there is confusion 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.480
 I don't know why we don't have a door 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.480
 closed 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.310
 this puts us in Italy 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.869
 what does it mean 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.130
 I think what I've always thought of all 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.660
 the season and we must be one 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.660
 team that 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.500
 must have more desire starting from 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 individual energy for the desire of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.250
 play together in attack and in defense e 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.850
 these two games have been I think 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 beautiful to look at and have been beautiful 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.170
 to live on this 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
 wonderful 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.640
 always said 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640
 Milan wins 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.920
 I don't want to have been 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.860
 I appreciate and the quality of the base of the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.170
 he asks why he likes you very much 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.730
 I believe that Milan is the big favorite 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.739
 and as I have always said it is 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.769
 objectively also for the quality of 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.390
 game he also had during this 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.690
 chair 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.849
 I believe we are even more 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.690
 therefore grown the big favorite 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:04.069
 remains milan and we are a little more 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.069
 close to the big favorite 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 Yup 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.050
 this is the question to turn is how it is 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:23.620
 play the bill again next time 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:29.290
 game to try to outdo myself I think 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.780
 that we can improve the reading of the 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.239
 their defense on pick and roll doing 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.910
 an aggressive show this time having 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.410
 let's say more triangle I also reveal the 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.480
 tactic but so there is no secret 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.940
 there is more to do than tactics better 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.810
 to play not with a direct pass 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.269
 but with a shift from the bank to who it is 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.320
 close to who is doubled this is 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.709
 a detail 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.350
 and as well as maybe we can also have 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.180
 more care not to let it arrive 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.769
 Milan to play the pick and roll and of 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.340
 transition that are the most difficult to 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.340
 stick up for
