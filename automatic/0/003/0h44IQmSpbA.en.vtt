right behind the camera there um it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.210

not<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.240> perfect<00:03:21.600> match<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.920> know<00:03:23.010> in

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
not a perfect match but you know in

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.070 
not a perfect match but you know in
maybe<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:23.700> some<00:03:23.850> different<00:03:24.180> lighting<00:03:24.390> I'm

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
maybe and some different lighting I'm

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.790 
maybe and some different lighting I'm
inside<00:03:25.470> obviously<00:03:27.350> they<00:03:28.350> would<00:03:28.500> look<00:03:28.650> good

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
inside obviously they would look good

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.750 
inside obviously they would look good
but<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> think<00:03:29.280> outside<00:03:31.310> they're<00:03:32.310> gonna<00:03:32.459> be<00:03:32.580> so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
but I think outside they're gonna be so

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.100 
but I think outside they're gonna be so
far<00:03:33.000> away<00:03:33.120> from<00:03:33.209> each<00:03:33.480> other<00:03:33.630> i<00:03:33.780> don't<00:03:33.930> think

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
far away from each other i don't think
