of<00:01:54.229> those<00:01:54.380> prim<00:01:54.649> related<00:01:55.039> torches<00:01:55.399> at<00:01:55.549> home

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
of those prim related torches at home

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.550 
of those prim related torches at home
what<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.270> can<00:01:56.509> do<00:01:56.659> is<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.929> can<00:01:56.959> serve<00:01:57.289> this<00:01:57.500> in

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
what you can do is you can serve this in

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.550 
what you can do is you can serve this in
a<00:01:57.799> dish<00:01:58.270> sprinkle<00:01:59.270> sugar<00:01:59.299> on<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.049> then

a dish sprinkle sugar on it and then

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.410 
a dish sprinkle sugar on it and then
torch<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:01.939> nice<00:02:02.090> little

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
torch it and be just nice little

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.179 
torch it and be just nice little
attitude<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.960> be<00:02:03.079> similar<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.680> creme<00:02:03.950> brulee

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
attitude to be similar to creme brulee

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.340 
attitude to be similar to creme brulee
with<00:02:04.219> rice<00:02:04.549> in<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.689> just<00:02:05.719> something<00:02:06.259> to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
with rice in it so just something to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.499 
with rice in it so just something to
think<00:02:06.439> about<00:02:06.789> so<00:02:07.789> what<00:02:07.969> I'm<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.360> is

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
think about so what I'm going to do is

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.940 
think about so what I'm going to do is
just<00:02:08.539> kind<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.869> stir<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.289> up<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.649> make<00:02:09.769> sure

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
just kind of stir this up to make sure

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.979 
just kind of stir this up to make sure
the<00:02:10.070> sugar<00:02:10.549> gets<00:02:10.759> incorporated<00:02:11.090> into<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
the sugar gets incorporated into the

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.180 
the sugar gets incorporated into the
milk<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.359> also<00:02:14.359> that<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> rice<00:02:15.410> doesn't<00:02:15.799> just

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
milk and also that the rice doesn't just

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.849 
milk and also that the rice doesn't just
clump<00:02:16.910> up<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.290> want<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.620> give<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.799> a

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
clump up so you just want to give it a

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.970 
clump up so you just want to give it a
like<00:02:19.040> stir<00:02:19.400> with<00:02:20.060> rice<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:20.540> know<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.620> may<00:02:21.799> or

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
like stir with rice you know you may or

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.380 
like stir with rice you know you may or
may<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.160> know<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.609> don't<00:02:22.760> want<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.940> start<00:02:23.090> too

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
may not know you don't want to start too

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.390 
may not know you don't want to start too
much<00:02:23.660> unless<00:02:23.989> you're<00:02:24.170> making<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.470> risotto<00:02:24.799> and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
much unless you're making a risotto and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.039 
much unless you're making a risotto and
right<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.850> we're<00:02:26.060> not<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.540> we<00:02:26.690> want<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.900> make

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
right here we're not so we want to make

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.330 
right here we're not so we want to make
sure<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.280> stays<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.700> nice<00:02:28.880> long<00:02:29.180> grain

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
sure that it stays the nice long grain

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.890 
sure that it stays the nice long grain
so<00:02:31.340> next<00:02:31.640> as<00:02:31.940> that's<00:02:32.209> heating<00:02:32.510> up<00:02:32.660> we're<00:02:32.810> going

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
so next as that's heating up we're going

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.280 
so next as that's heating up we're going
to<00:02:32.989> take<00:02:33.140> our<00:02:33.200> ace<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.870> want<00:02:36.079> to<00:02:36.140> do

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
to take our ace and all you want to do

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.920 
to take our ace and all you want to do
is<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.500> get<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.890> mixing<00:02:37.310> bowl<00:02:37.489> with<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> whisk

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.399 

and<00:02:42.439> put<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.709> egg<00:02:42.829> yolks<00:02:43.099> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.370> bowl<00:02:44.409> there

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
and put the egg yolks in the bowl there

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.620 
and put the egg yolks in the bowl there
we<00:02:45.500> go

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
we go

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.000 
we go
and<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:49.050> you'll<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.290> take<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.620> egg<00:02:49.800> yolks

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and then you'll just take your egg yolks

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.040 
and then you'll just take your egg yolks
and<00:02:50.220> whisk<00:02:50.700> them<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.270> little<00:02:51.300> bit<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.020> that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
and whisk them just a little bit so that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.410 
and whisk them just a little bit so that
they're<00:02:52.320> broken<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.120> do

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
they're broken up so all we have to do

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.340 
they're broken up so all we have to do
is<00:02:54.570> add<00:02:54.840> them<00:02:55.080> add<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.250> into<00:02:56.430> there<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.350> don't

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
is add them add it into there I don't

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.260 
is add them add it into there I don't
know<00:02:58.440> too<00:02:58.710> many<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> guys<00:02:59.310> made<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.640> custard

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
know too many of you guys made a custard

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.000 
know too many of you guys made a custard
but<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.720> custards<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.470> bit<00:03:01.590> difficult<00:03:01.770> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
but a custards a little bit difficult to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.130 
but a custards a little bit difficult to
make<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.520> because<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.300> egg<00:03:03.480> yolks<00:03:03.780> may

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
make just because the egg yolks may

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710 
make just because the egg yolks may
break<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.860> kind<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.100> kurtal<00:03:05.460> up<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
break and kind of kurtal up in there and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.480 
break and kind of kurtal up in there and
so<00:03:07.020> I'm<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.530> show<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.860> little<00:03:08.070> tip<00:03:08.280> on

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
so I'm going to show you a little tip on

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.150 
so I'm going to show you a little tip on
how<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> incorporate<00:03:10.080> your<00:03:10.470> eggs<00:03:10.680> into<00:03:10.980> this

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
how to incorporate your eggs into this

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.060 
how to incorporate your eggs into this
hot<00:03:11.400> liquid<00:03:11.850> without<00:03:12.740> having<00:03:13.740> your<00:03:13.860> eggs

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
hot liquid without having your eggs

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.730 
hot liquid without having your eggs
break<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:16.260> we're<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.590> add<00:03:16.710> our

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
break and so we're going to add our

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.150 
break and so we're going to add our
vanilla<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.520> as<00:03:17.640> well<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:19.290> one<00:03:19.500> teaspoon

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.810 

it's<00:03:23.160> an<00:03:23.220> exact<00:03:23.670> science<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.270> tell<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:26.550> I'm

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
it's an exact science I tell you so I'm

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.870 
it's an exact science I tell you so I'm
going<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.030> whisk<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.270> in<00:03:27.540> there<00:03:27.690> as<00:03:27.810> well

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
going to whisk that in there as well

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.600 
going to whisk that in there as well
we're<00:03:29.880> just<00:03:30.060> kind<00:03:30.210> of<00:03:30.240> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.450> let<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.630> set

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
we're just kind of going to let that set

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.450 
we're just kind of going to let that set
until<00:03:32.930> our<00:03:33.930> mixture<00:03:34.590> right<00:03:34.770> here<00:03:35.010> comes<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.430> a

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
until our mixture right here comes to a

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.150 
until our mixture right here comes to a
little<00:03:36.420> bit<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.720> boil<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.770> when<00:03:37.980> that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
little bit of a boil and when that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.610 
little bit of a boil and when that
happens<00:03:38.960> what<00:03:39.960> I'm<00:03:40.080> going<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> do<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.590> it's

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
happens what I'm going to do is it's

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.560 
happens what I'm going to do is it's
called<00:03:40.950> tempering<00:03:41.430> your<00:03:41.490> eggs<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.390> when

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
called tempering your eggs and when

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.200 
called tempering your eggs and when
you're<00:03:42.690> tempering<00:03:43.080> your<00:03:43.110> eggs<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:44.640> got<00:03:44.820> cold

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
you're tempering your eggs you got cold
