00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.140
 a month ago and peak Beni have someone believe that he was dismissed badly not 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.949
 in it for exogenous reasons 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.589
 nothing related to its management 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.300
 the able person honored very hardworking 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.270
 not smart not to pretend what worries me is that I was doing 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.700
 he is undergoing a process of almost romantic reconversion 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 percent for the sake of the crisis 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 what I have taken advantage of better there what you have to do is 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.660
 the firm is more than ever in their talents 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.809
 in your self-esteem 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.050
 in its values 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.210
 and will be happy 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.430
 celebrate in quotes and want 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.230
 ch that does not serve in that company that makes decisions in manhattan 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.770
 so free no 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.950
 instead 13s for putting us 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.110
 the case more 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.800
 dramatic dismissal board sometimes 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.860
 The dismissal 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.090
 has causes 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.050
 substantiated has something to do with your question counted 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.460
 uu with all professional solvency 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.610
 and maybe it's the push we need 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.650
 for opa is being refined sometimes 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.290
 the human being messi you approach the precipice to investigate according to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 you are a little more in k1 we are not ituarte 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.880
 in the vital moment it may sound heavy since I know career age project 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.540
 family 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.829
 and the same ones 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.630
 dn make an answer 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.850
 settled or the talented the character 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.950
 ii always always she gives for optimism not 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.230
 it's not 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.060
 hides reality but 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.000
 face the problems that it poses with hope and passion 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.660
 excitement yesterday a person 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.060
 it is also 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.630
 on the tightrope 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.370
 they think they are going to take say drastic measures and that now affects 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.830
 and then what are I see what is feeding that also feeding 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.900
 that also a latent project 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.469
 the oven control 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.989
 who believes that I think he's going to get enke ex brave to take the step 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.319
 that assumes the risk 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.229
 I'm liking the minimum financial muscle you need 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.139
 qi good and maybe thanks to that crisis 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.310
 urgently an entrepreneur that maybe 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.279
 if it had not been dormant for life 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.179
 the crisis did not dismantle the moment to stop 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.689
 so that self-esteem is removed backwards but to make it stronger be 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.689
 our our compass roars inside 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.369
 in this country for example it costs more from that country 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:41.419
 no longer just pigeonhole you, even we ourselves are pigeonholed 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.209
 one follows industrial sector pressure 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.400
 in United States 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.759
 you can start an industry ride it 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:52.619
 your own company hit you nothing the error or failure not testicular chalk wolf and 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.109
 catalÃ¡ politica returns his private company 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.579
 you go in and you go different 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.229
 activities without that supposes frivolity 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.229
 there was a restless soul that is unknown 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.049
 In that sense, this country I believe Spain as to the crossroads that 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.529
 any gbc means that it is more 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.360
 is 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.589
 it is more conservative 1 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.129
 tt encapsulate 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.089
 in a sian 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.089
 tencan sudan in a pressure on a 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.120
 i all that is from the interview very well 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.869
 until the match with two obstacles not a goal from nothing 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 some are 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.869
 guilty something on the contrary was very in platense interview 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:34.609
 looks younger 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.629
 the daily forty-odd lae emerges 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.109
 the summer list 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.709
 and then other forums 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.129
 any turn more - Copernican to engage in a new activity 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.569
 they are criminal until well by them 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.259
 but in the end we have to have the ability to trust and 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.640
 nor the talent spend managing those substances 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.079
 I think the important thing is 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.549
 to gather your strengths to know you well 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.879
 and design a career that aligns with your surroundings because from there 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.989
 I was going to see the coso the term of pleasure the passion of the use of energy 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.200
 to add in 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.129
 in a different environment 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.569
 within prudence logically and there we are a 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.720
 associates me here to May not people who know us well that their third is expressed 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.909
 quarter 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.909
 I'm afraid that sometimes the tips are basic or conventional 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.499
 too many standards guides for the environment by the market 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.430
 by the shift singer cantor 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.130
 Of course, we must ask about the economic situation on the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.360
 demand the offer 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 about my academic training to her grandmother and my shortcomings 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.430
 I think we have to do a little bit more 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.870
 which he welcomed if he smiles and take advantage of the crisis with told what she 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.009
 it is with you 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.309
 Step 2 points 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.840
 more about our identity 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.330
 who I am 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.280
 there is a place that my work lives in this changing ethic work no 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.400
 our children 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.550
 do not understand 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.310
 montiel works in a way that I do not know is that we or our parents do not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.759
 we have gone from ethics maybe to work where based on the same tour 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.089
 still 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.029
 to some creations that have nailed engravings that what they want is 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.039
 live and serve the verb live this works 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.909
 and that are much more sensitive to the schedule to flexibility 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.490
 to the quality of life although 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.550
 although this also valqui hacienda and new vision and a moderation 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.900
 differentiate because why because he matches has made it complicated 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.960
 and we are not for many flourishes 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.759
 on the margin is based on an invitation to post-abortion area 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.279
 effort discipline work 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.490
 that this country of dt 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.860
 had precedent based 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.879
 percent 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.980
 on the basis that you want to work with the United States 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.840
 nica of controls to use 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.139
 if you have to go to a physical presence 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.930
 because if it does not there seems to be compromise and therefore it does not look like 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.619
 active member of the firm 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.330
 or if he refused, I do it for my contribution to the common preaching 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.810
 per hundred and I can combine an intense and very committed work with 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.810
 a close family life that is success 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.009
 This is the success of and who defined it and based on what it answered 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.739
 and the bottom insists to the question who am I hope that the quick those people 

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.539
 I knew that there waiting for the visit of 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.639
 of the infarct 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.050
 Well, to formulate your daughter 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.330
 since the crisis sink a little chair that slip that life to make us is 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.569
 of type questions 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.279
 delicate but difficult but necessary
