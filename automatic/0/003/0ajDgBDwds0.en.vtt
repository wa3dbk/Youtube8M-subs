00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.240
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.710
 video on the life we ​​may have 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 Today, it's about a product 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.730
 from panasonic and then the whole is one 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.529
 notebook though no gaming notebooks man 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.600
 rather a work or me 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.080
 now uses device what you just do not 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 so for the actual noble office 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.610
 use uses yes so looks the whole 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.860
 collapsed or from above from me who 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.160
 provider of the alu layer that, however 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.840
 made of plastic 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.870
 and here again the black one 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.120
 kept top with the panasonic logo 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 if you can the notebook to work 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.219
 you just read that from behind 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.770
 Most manufacturers now so here 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.910
 connect under it cheaper 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 Information or hints the times now 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.809
 Do not do anything and if you are 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 asks why the notebook or in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.390
 Quote funny looks too 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.640
 here with this handle we have here 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.180
 to wear the whole thing on shorter ones 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.270
 stretch 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.119
 the whole thing is a panasonic toughbook cf 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.650
 53 just as mentioned at the beginning just stop 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.860
 no traditional office device but 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.909
 rather something for the work or for the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.890
 use outside on the move and both 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.590
 Also times what quotes on quotes 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.579
 yes, and I can fly 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.600
 We would say, and if you look 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.920
 all the connections to that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 well-known and the technical data 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.380
 Of course, it still works for me 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.000
 look at the notebook and see it 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.399
 Here we are even better here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.939
 We also understood this again 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.380
 smooth inside and then now 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.210
 the inside so that's for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 compared to the predecessor a little smaller 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 Everything has become since we have only one here 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.600
 14 inch display have up here and then 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.680
 logically , the whole thing 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.250
 has become smaller 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:11.750
 installed is an intel i5 namely the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.970
 3000 320m windows 7 preinstalled 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.720
 logically fortunately not yet 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.370
 Windows 8 to 4 gigabytes of RAM 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.340
 and logically then also the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:31.700
 intel hd graphics and that the 4000s 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:33.740
 series feature each other and the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.340
 Manufacturer promises and eleven hours 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.320
 clear expect one of his 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.630
 work tool in quotation marks and 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.880
 that is pretty accurate 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.650
 the keyboard is of course everything 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.270
 packed together and kept very small 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.430
 have the farthest here, for example 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.370
 have down here and otherwise but 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.950
 nice and clear 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.580
 up here on or off or power 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.520
 button 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.480
 otherwise it was on the side or 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.490
 up here already 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.990
 We have here a respectively 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.190
 two stereo loudspeakers here 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.980
 integrates the touchpad with the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.180
 mouse buttons which also a bit nicer 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.840
 has become in comparison to the old one 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.730
 device-so here then demanded ever 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.890
 two connections and that the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.010
 Headphone output with cad microphone input 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.430
 And every amount of information salad is yes 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.280
 me in front of 2 informations leds to battery and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.920
 on the top up here what now 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.860
 just can not see hard disks 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.890
 load SD card slot and on 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.480
 block activated and so on that is on 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.090
 the front right side 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.100
 Now if we turn it to the left 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.100
 So look at the right side 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.330
 we have the battery here once 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.030
 battery slot falls that is here 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.260
 covered is located further back 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.610
 then another opening for 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.950
 sd-card settings then too 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.709
 could use this plug-in cards 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.670
 this gap and at the very bottom of the wlan 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.440
 or on switch on the whole rear 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.850
 page we have then once the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.730
 Charging socket for the charger 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.710
 logically and here again something 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.010
 very nice and twice 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.380
 usb 3.0 bit now blue and white 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.720
 I also that transferable for free but 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:30.220
 that's 2 x usb 3.0 that's the new one 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:33.110
 feature in the cf 53 usb 3.0 every us 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.600
 everyone knows and faster 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.040
 Data transfer easier to work 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.540
 and everything is more comfortable now we start with 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.950
 the back of the terminals there 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.540
 then we have on the left side 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.980
 first of all the lan socket so for 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.270
 Of course we have our network here 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.400
 we still have wlan we have right now 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.990
 see the and from switch and 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.150
 2 x usb 2.0 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.280
 You can not miss that either and 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.560
 next to it are the graphics 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.650
 slot with a hdmi in a vga 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.920
 exit and of course on the far right 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.060
 a small piece of field and there we have 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.740
 if we really get it off one 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.800
 serial interface the left side 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.710
 here is free then I think then the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.050
 additional optional function with 3g 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.060
 that is about sim card that's synonymous 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.200
 another variant to add 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.680
 but can now, however, 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.120
 not installed is last but not least 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.420
 of course, above any normal 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.160
 notebook a netbook and no ultrabook 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.550
 a dvd or 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.400
 cd drive we have a dvd multi 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.710
 installed on the left side and 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.740
 there is nothing special here no blu ray 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.900
 nothing at all but it fulfills its purpose as 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.630
 the whole just with a notebook too 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.180
 So I hope so the video too 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.300
 you liked the few sonic cf 53 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.240
 even if you are not a Jacob here now 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.770
 Nevertheless, gaming hardware was a very good one 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.000
 nice notebook and as I said writes 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.190
 my comment gives me thumbs up 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.320
 if it has fallen and it will 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.690
 soon again a few 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.600
 At least I have more videos to follow 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.960
 planned and doing well until the next 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.960
 Video
