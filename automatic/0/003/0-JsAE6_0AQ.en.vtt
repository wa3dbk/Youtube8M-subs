you got a tuna lead so early on you seem
to<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.210> naturally<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> tend<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.579> may

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to think it's naturally to tend to may

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
to think it's naturally to tend to may
not<00:00:53.760> sit<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> games<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> bag<00:00:55.050> but

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
not sit think the games in the bag but

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439

and<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> comfortable<00:00:56.699> lead<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.300> may

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and it got a comfortable lead you may

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.840 
and it got a comfortable lead you may
take<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:57.960> foot<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> gas<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.070> and
