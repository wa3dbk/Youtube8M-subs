along one of them this morning to define
the<00:00:22.980> limits<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.970> came<00:00:24.180> across<00:00:24.449> what<00:00:24.869> looks

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the limits we came across what looks

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.980 
the limits we came across what looks
like<00:00:25.199> maybe<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.680> piece<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.279> compass<00:00:26.699> an<00:00:27.599> ivory

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
like maybe a piece of a compass an ivory

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.839 
like maybe a piece of a compass an ivory
or<00:00:28.080> bone<00:00:28.199> compass<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
or bone compass and because of the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.640 
or bone compass and because of the
nature<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.510> artifact<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
nature of that artifact and it's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
nature of that artifact and it's
material<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.340> made<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:33.600> want

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
material that it's made out of we want

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.380 
material that it's made out of we want
to<00:00:33.870> remove<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.140> immediately<00:00:35.149> to<00:00:36.149> help

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to remove that immediately to help

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.080 
to remove that immediately to help
because<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.870> vulnerable<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.710> cracking<00:00:38.340> from

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because it's vulnerable to cracking from

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.520 
because it's vulnerable to cracking from
the<00:00:39.239> elements<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.079> we're<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> go

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the elements and so we're going to go

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.020 
the elements and so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> remove<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.790> item<00:00:42.140> right<00:00:43.140> now

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
century and what we're gonna do now is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.550 
century and what we're gonna do now is
reverse<00:02:53.230> engineer<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:55.000> latitude<00:02:55.569> this

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
reverse engineer what latitude this

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.630 
reverse engineer what latitude this
timepiece<00:02:57.549> was<00:02:57.760> constructed<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:59.549> okay<00:03:00.549> I'm

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
timepiece was constructed for okay I'm

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.330 
timepiece was constructed for okay I'm
going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.849> use<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.709> image<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.739> I've<00:03:03.070> blown

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
going to use this image that I've blown

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.120 
going to use this image that I've blown
up<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.019> compass<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.299> extend<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
up of the compass and extend the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.710 
up of the compass and extend the
reference<00:03:09.130> lines<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.760> our<00:03:09.910> reference<00:03:10.480> lines

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
reference lines the our reference lines

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.060 
reference lines the our reference lines
and<00:03:11.590> use<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.340> Sorrels<00:03:13.090> latitude<00:03:13.870> scale<00:03:14.290> to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
and use this Sorrels latitude scale to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.330 
and use this Sorrels latitude scale to
reverse-engineer<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.840> latitude<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
reverse-engineer the latitude of the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:34.070 
reverse-engineer the latitude of the
that<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.820> compass<00:03:19.120> was<00:03:19.239> made<00:03:19.480> for

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.030 

you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.190> see<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.520> reference<00:03:36.000> lines<00:03:36.270> six<00:03:37.200> five

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
you can see the reference lines six five

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.850 
you can see the reference lines six five
four<00:03:38.880> three<00:03:39.530> two<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.730> noon<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.900> what

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
four three two one and noon and what

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.400 
four three two one and noon and what
you're<00:03:44.070> trying<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.090> match<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.750> each<00:03:45.900> one

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
you're trying to do is match up each one

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.880 
you're trying to do is match up each one
of<00:03:46.620> these<00:03:46.860> with<00:03:47.460> each<00:03:47.760> one<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:49.170> extended

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
of these with each one of the extended

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.950 
of these with each one of the extended
our<00:03:50.850> lines<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.320> dial<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.720> looks

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
our lines on this dial so it looks

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.350 
our lines on this dial so it looks
somewhere<00:03:58.470> right<00:03:58.710> about<00:03:59.010> there<00:04:00.140> now<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.170> make<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
somewhere right about there now I make a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.760 
somewhere right about there now I make a
mark<00:04:03.620> where<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.650> six<00:04:05.430> o'clock<00:04:07.550> hips<00:04:08.550> and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
mark where the six o'clock hips and

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.490 
mark where the six o'clock hips and
switch<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:12.000> latitude<00:04:12.990> line<00:04:14.420> on<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:16.140> scale

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
switch to the latitude line on the scale

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.699 
switch to the latitude line on the scale
and<00:04:16.830> then<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:18.180> measure<00:04:18.450> from<00:04:19.049> from<00:04:19.500> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
and then I can measure from from the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.410 
and then I can measure from from the
twelve<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:23.220> see<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:24.120> this<00:04:24.330> was<00:04:24.630> designed<00:04:26.420> for

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
twelve to see that this was designed for

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:41.839 
twelve to see that this was designed for
the<00:04:27.800> fifty<00:04:28.800> one<00:04:29.640> two<00:04:30.120> three<00:04:31.160> 53rd<00:04:32.160> latitude
