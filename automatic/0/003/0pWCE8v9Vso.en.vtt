detection and maybe just some what's

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480 
detection and maybe just some what's
about<00:00:17.730> recoil<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.690> sniper<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.430> can

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
about recoil with sniper so as you can

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.010 
about recoil with sniper so as you can
see<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.390> slow<00:00:21.539> down<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:21.960> you

see there I'm going to slow down for you
now<00:00:22.199> um<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.699> clearly<00:00:24.210> has<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> sniper<00:00:25.130> beside<00:00:26.130> his

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
now um I clearly has a sniper beside his

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
now um I clearly has a sniper beside his
head<00:00:27.140> but<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.099> shoot<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:30.029> seems<00:00:30.720> like

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
head but then as you shoot it seems like

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
head but then as you shoot it seems like
it<00:00:31.050> registers<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:31.980> except<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:32.850> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it registers are there except then you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.030 
it registers are there except then you
can<00:00:33.149> see<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> scope<00:00:34.110> go<00:00:34.680> straight<00:00:35.010> over

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
can see how the scope go straight over

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.150 
can see how the scope go straight over
to<00:00:35.399> his<00:00:35.550> head<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.870> about<00:00:37.110> more<00:00:37.980> like

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
to his head so it's all about more like

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.680 
to his head so it's all about more like
what<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:39.260> if<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> goes<00:00:40.559> over<00:00:41.690> or

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
what you think about if it goes over or

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.760 
what you think about if it goes over or
if<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.500> literally<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> hit<00:00:44.969> detection

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
if it literally is just a hit detection

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
if it literally is just a hit detection
now<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:47.640> gonna<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.940> me<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.239> trying<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
now you're gonna see me here trying it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.910 
now you're gonna see me here trying it
on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> left<00:00:49.829> side<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.190> his<00:00:50.399> head<00:00:51.140> which<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
on the left side of his head which you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
on the left side of his head which you
can<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.789> where<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> bullets<00:00:54.449> curve

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
can then see it where the bullets curve

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.110 
can then see it where the bullets curve
and<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.649> tree<00:00:56.090> way<00:00:57.090> off<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:59.120> this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and go into the tree way off so this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
and go into the tree way off so this
could<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> issue<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> oh<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
could be the issue of this oh and this

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
could be the issue of this oh and this
is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> sniper<00:01:02.579> without<00:01:03.270> anything<00:01:03.809> any<00:01:04.729> like<00:01:05.729> um

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
is a sniper without anything any like um

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
is a sniper without anything any like um
perks<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.060> yeah<00:01:09.060> um<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.250> see

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
perks on it so yeah um but you can see

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
perks on it so yeah um but you can see
that<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> bullets<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.630> off<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that the bullets are going way off and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.820 
that the bullets are going way off and
the<00:01:13.470> tree<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> they<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> they're<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.770> going

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the tree and they and they're not going

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
the tree and they and they're not going
to<00:01:17.009> curve<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.090> his<00:01:18.210> head<00:01:18.450> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to curve right is into his head so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.670 
to curve right is into his head so
that's<00:01:19.799> why<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.369> thinking<00:01:20.670> might<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that's why I'm thinking might not be the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
that's why I'm thinking might not be the
hit<00:01:22.830> detection<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:24.450> probably<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
hit detection it's probably just the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.210 
hit detection it's probably just the
recoil

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.670 

you<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:31.000> see<00:01:31.240> i'll<00:01:31.450> show<00:01:31.660> you<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:32.110> later<00:01:32.470> in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
basically it just goes straight through

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.680

his upper arm you can hit that but it

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.449 
his upper arm you can hit that but it
looks<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:07.720> from<00:02:08.020> his<00:02:08.200> elbow<00:02:08.940> down<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:11.459> down
