the water and the fish run away you can
move<00:00:52.720> leaves<00:00:53.079> around<00:00:53.320> by<00:00:53.710> holding<00:00:54.190> on<00:00:54.340> them

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
move leaves around by holding on them

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.200 
move leaves around by holding on them
sometimes<00:00:56.920> it<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.219> hard<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.489> hold<00:00:57.760> them<00:00:58.030> but

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
sometimes it is hard to hold them but

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.260 
sometimes it is hard to hold them but
they're<00:00:58.510> high<00:00:58.809> moves<00:00:59.050> one<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.640> can<00:01:00.850> move<00:01:01.030> them

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
they're high moves one you can move them

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.959 
they're high moves one you can move them
all<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:06.149> eventually<00:01:07.149> more<00:01:07.360> fish<00:01:07.630> will<00:01:07.869> come

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969

the iphone and before I couldn't reveal
with<00:01:58.200> ipod<00:01:58.590> touch<00:01:58.830> since<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.370> wasn't<00:01:59.580> an

external<00:02:00.390> sound<00:02:00.690> or<00:02:00.990> speaker<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.260> is<00:02:04.410> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
external sound or speaker so this is a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.680 
external sound or speaker so this is a
short<00:02:04.830> review<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.310> told<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.730> of<00:02:05.820> koi<00:02:06.030> pond<00:02:06.420> i

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
short review as I told you of koi pond i

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.090 
short review as I told you of koi pond i
am<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> give<00:02:07.620> this<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.340> 8<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> 10<00:02:10.100> I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
am going to give this a 8 out of 10 I

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.580 
am going to give this a 8 out of 10 I
took<00:02:11.520> two<00:02:12.390> points<00:02:12.750> off<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.200> because<00:02:13.350> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
took two points off just because I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.140 
took two points off just because I
thought<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.830> could<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.310> been<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:15.000> more

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
thought it could have been a little more

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.140 
thought it could have been a little more
than<00:02:15.990> just<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.890> eight<00:02:17.490> out<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> ten<00:02:17.970> is
