00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:11.660
 Yes then let's see in turn 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:18.200
 Mixed meal concentration 8% saline 400 g 12% salt water and mix a 200 g 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.540
 Other In also this or salt water is what percentage of the concentration of saline problem called concentration calculation problems 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.080
 If it is similar in structure 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.350
 Asked for that nonverbal ability inference 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.350
 It is population density 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.620
 This p Lord have found that population density and population density of Kyushu pc and population the combined Kyushu 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 It is structurally similar to the problem of density etc. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 If you look at what kind of structure, then the first data you're winning is salt water ab now 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.340
 I named it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.660
 a saline solution at a concentration of 8% 405 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:54.580
 Ram b's saline solution 200g at a concentration of 12% 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.390
 Say x% since and is here determine the concentration of the combined saline unsure 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.200
 Let's keep in mind 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.600
 It is an image that will gradually fills the table First 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:11.630
 Considering how much salt is contained in each of the saline solutions ab 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:16.730
 Because it is concentration, a is 32g by 400g over 8% 0.08 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:23.150
 You can also see that b contains 24g of salt 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:26.750
 If you mix salt ab , then the combined a + b salt solution is 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.760
 600g in weight of the saline 400 + 200 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:36.380
 You can see that the weight of the salt is 56 grams at 32 + 24 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.700
 You can determine the concentration if you know the weight of Seto salt even in the sequel brain 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 The node is the weight of normal cone and the weight of salt 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.780
 You multiplied by 100 in relation to it the percentage referred to in the now of the problem and saline 600 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 The salt is 56, so it 's 56/600 times 100. This is 9 points behind the police. 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 It will be about 9.3% because I will be Sasa . 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.980
 Oh is the fact that the concentration calculation of the problem 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:09.119
 It is good next 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:14.700
 And have 40 people I'm say Motomero the average score when the total points in the 1456-point test 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.560
 In other words, I do not know the average score, but the total score and the sum are 2456 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.470
 The number of people know 42 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:28.770
 Though it has also lower high or the number determined by how do I point average people person Saga it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:33.670
 If it wasn't the case, everyone would be the same as the strike amount , that is, the total benefits 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.580
 The average score can be obtained by dividing by the number of people . 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 Number 1456 points to a total of 44 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 It is 1456 points when we put 40 in ten people 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.370
 Of course there may be 0 people or 100 people, but everyone's Abe 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.410
 How many same scores will be 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.400
 In other words, it seems like it will finish cutting the total by the number of people and dividing it by 40 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.870
 Average score 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 In the formula, average points can be divided by the total number of people 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.130
 Specifically, 2456 divided by 40 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 It will be 61.4 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:15.120
 Then Udesu 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:20.640
 In time it says that determine the speed I speed at the time ran the 5km in 20 minutes x 20 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.950
 The minute distance is 5km, but it is written 5000m from how many meters are written 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.480
 I will fix it to my body 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.140
 Speed took 20 minutes to go 5km 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:36.790
 Of course there may be a start dash or a last spurt in it. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:42.879
 But if there were no waves of those early slows, how fast would it be on average 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:48.549
 In other words, if we ran at the same speed for 20 minutes, the distance of 5000 meters would 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.780
 The'm You're Mari 5000m thing to say or how much per minute more and more and in 20 minutes 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.980
 It feels like I'm cutting 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.780
 The length of the entire distance because the calculation formula in the speaking speed 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:04.060
 It should be divided by the time it took 5000 bad 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.060
 20 You can see that say 250m par minute I 250m per minute 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.730
 This is the last meeting The picture is 120 km / h this time and I know how far it will go in 4 hours 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.930
 I'm buying it 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.200
 It fast to know is per hour 120 kg and time 4 hours 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.630
 Then how long do you do 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.770
 Express trains that go about 20 kilometers now how fast will it go per hour 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.020
 It is there when Iun 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.940
 1 hour 120 km 3 hours 249-3 hours 360 km live 4 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.730
 It is time, so this is not a multiplication 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.190
 That is because advanced distance may be multiplied by the time the speed 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.400
 120 calls 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.970
 You will be choosing 480km ahead 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.210
 By the way, I feel that I have already understood the answer, but let's summarize 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:55.539
 It does not like in other concentration mountain of Aha saline 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:05:01.360
 The concentration of the two saline solutions is known, and the weight of each saline solution is calculated using it 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:02.390
 Determine the weight of the mixed a + b saline solution and the weight of a + b salt finally 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.260
 Mixed color 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:14.220
 2 It was the method of calculation of concentration calculation population density to find concentration of water 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:15.380
 Next, I know the total score and the number of people, so divide the total by the number of people and divide by the average score 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.620
 How it works 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:26.090
 Likewise, we know the distance and time, and the fixed distance travels over 1000 minutes in 20 minutes. 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.120
 For those who divide the speed of 250m per minute 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.690
 formula 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.919
 Now I know the speed is 120 km / h and the time is 4 hours. 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.100
 Say the to 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:47.139
 How it was determined was structurally similar if you look at the whole or divide by time each time 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:50.430
 Hit is the number of distance per number of persons Ito say that is required it is therefore correct 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.430
 It will be good 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.610
