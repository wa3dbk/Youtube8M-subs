00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
still have my media and very easy access

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:34.250 
still have my media and very easy access
so<00:03:29.630> on<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.750> top<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.349> has<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:32.239> micro<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.569> think

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so on the top it has a micro I think

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.099 
so on the top it has a micro I think
it's<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.380> 1.5<00:03:34.889> millimeter<00:03:35.160> or<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.870> three<00:03:36.870> point

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
it's a 1.5 millimeter or a three point

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.180 
it's a 1.5 millimeter or a three point
five<00:03:37.230> instead<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.590> four<00:03:37.650> point<00:03:38.069> five

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
five instead of four point five

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.120 
five instead of four point five
millimeter<00:03:38.459> jack<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.620> cannot<00:03:40.829> take<00:03:41.099> a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130

you can just kind of notice the

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.219 
you can just kind of notice the
indentation<00:05:04.060> for<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.569> speaker<00:05:04.840> on<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:05.050> side

and<00:05:05.259> over<00:05:05.590> here<00:05:05.740> on<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:05.949> side<00:05:06.009> but<00:05:06.969> upon

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
and over here on this side but upon

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.089 
and over here on this side but upon
closer<00:05:07.900> inspection<00:05:08.139> I'm<00:05:08.590> fairly<00:05:08.949> certain

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
closer inspection I'm fairly certain

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.399 
closer inspection I'm fairly certain
that<00:05:09.400> both<00:05:09.759> speakers<00:05:10.300> are<00:05:10.539> on<00:05:10.719> this<00:05:11.110> side<00:05:11.349> of

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
that both speakers are on this side of

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.480 
that both speakers are on this side of
the<00:05:11.680> phone<00:05:13.169> which<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:14.199> interesting<00:05:14.740> but<00:05:15.430> I

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
the phone which is interesting but I

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.179 
the phone which is interesting but I
guess<00:05:15.639> they<00:05:15.789> still<00:05:15.849> can<00:05:16.120> call<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.389> stereo<00:05:17.189> the

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
guess they still can call it stereo the

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.709 
guess they still can call it stereo the
mic<00:05:18.339> is<00:05:18.370> located<00:05:18.879> on<00:05:18.969> the<00:05:19.029> base<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.509> phone

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
mic is located on the base of the phone

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.269 
mic is located on the base of the phone
here<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:21.400> as<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:21.729> rotates<00:05:22.210> it's<00:05:22.860> still<00:05:23.860> could

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
here so as it rotates it's still could

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.540 
here so as it rotates it's still could
be<00:05:24.310> picks<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.639> up<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:26.740> far<00:05:26.919> I've<00:05:27.039> only<00:05:27.129> had<00:05:27.339> one

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
be picks it up so far I've only had one

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.600

call dropped and a few calls being a

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.640
