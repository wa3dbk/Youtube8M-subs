00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
today I'm going to be talking about a

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.450 
today I'm going to be talking about a
question<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.720> I<00:00:03.750> often<00:00:04.020> get<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:05.250> is

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
question that I often get and that is

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.849 
question that I often get and that is
how<00:00:05.850> do<00:00:05.910> i<00:00:06.150> hook<00:00:06.359> up<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.720> light<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.710> my

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
how do i hook up a light to my

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.040 
how do i hook up a light to my
snowblower<00:00:08.130> as<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.269> can<00:00:09.420> see<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.750> snowblower

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
snowblower as you can see the snowblower

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.600 
snowblower as you can see the snowblower
has<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> light<00:00:10.650> over<00:00:10.889> here<00:00:10.920> which<00:00:11.309> came<00:00:11.580> with

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
has a light over here which came with

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.270 
has a light over here which came with
the<00:00:11.820> snowblower<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> people<00:00:13.769> are<00:00:13.860> asking<00:00:13.980> me

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the snowblower so people are asking me

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.890 
the snowblower so people are asking me
how<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.580> i<00:00:14.700> hook<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.150> light<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> snowblower

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
how do i hook up a light to snowblower

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
how do i hook up a light to snowblower
that<00:00:16.199> did<00:00:16.379> not<00:00:16.500> come<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> light

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that did not come with a light

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.240 
that did not come with a light
originally<00:00:18.350> while<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.560> my<00:00:19.740> bench<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.130> have

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
originally while here on my bench I have

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
originally while here on my bench I have
two<00:00:20.430> Tecumseh<00:00:20.910> engines<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> are<00:00:21.570> apart<00:00:21.990> one

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
two Tecumseh engines that are apart one

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.380 
two Tecumseh engines that are apart one
of<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.400> over<00:00:23.670> there<00:00:23.850> actually

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of them the one over there actually

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.450 
of them the one over there actually
powers<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> light<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.039> does<00:00:26.430> not

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
powers up a light and this one does not

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
powers up a light and this one does not
have<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.910> ability<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.590> gonna

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
have the ability to do that so I'm gonna

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160 
have the ability to do that so I'm gonna
explain<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.460> why<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
explain to you why that is so if you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600 
explain to you why that is so if you
wanna<00:00:31.320> hook<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.740> light<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.219> snowblower

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
wanna hook up a light to your snowblower

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
wanna hook up a light to your snowblower
you<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> make<00:00:33.390> sure<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.960> underneath

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you want to make sure that underneath

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990 
you want to make sure that underneath
the<00:00:34.620> flywheel<00:00:35.040> there's<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.820> these

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the flywheel there's one of these

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.350 
the flywheel there's one of these
Staters<00:00:36.750> over<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.360> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
Staters over here as you can see this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
Staters over here as you can see this
little<00:00:39.660> unit<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.079> acts<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> generator<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
little unit here acts as a generator it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
little unit here acts as a generator it
does<00:00:41.670> produce<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> current

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
does produce a little bit of current

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.040 
does produce a little bit of current
enough<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> power<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.550> light<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
enough to power up a light and this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.709 
enough to power up a light and this
older<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.649> come<00:00:46.829> set<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> points

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
older to come set here has the points

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.930 
older to come set here has the points
and<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> coil<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.620> underneath<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.460> flywheel

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and the coil all underneath the flywheel

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.299 
and the coil all underneath the flywheel
so<00:00:51.660> there's<00:00:51.930> no<00:00:52.140> room<00:00:52.379> left<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.980> small

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so there's no room left for a small

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
so there's no room left for a small
stator<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.449> produce<00:00:54.660> electricity<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.770> on

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
stator to produce electricity like on

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
stator to produce electricity like on
this<00:00:56.190> motor<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:58.020> why<00:00:58.199> if

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
this motor over here so that's why if

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.869 
this motor over here so that's why if
you<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.590> older<00:00:58.829> Tecumseh<00:00:59.370> engine<00:00:59.730> like

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you have an older Tecumseh engine like

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.580 
you have an older Tecumseh engine like
this<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.359> even<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> Briggs<00:01:01.440> &amp;

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this or even some of the Briggs &amp;

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.979 
this or even some of the Briggs &amp;
Stratton<00:01:01.620> engines<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.660> cannot

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
Stratton engines are the same you cannot

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.679 
Stratton engines are the same you cannot
power<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.680> light<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> stator<00:01:05.820> located

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
power up a light with the stator located

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
power up a light with the stator located
under<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> flywheel<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:08.130> there's<00:01:08.310> no

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
under the flywheel because there's no

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.140 
under the flywheel because there's no
room<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
room for it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
room for it
now<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> reason<00:01:10.380> why<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> stator

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
now the reason why you can have a stator

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
now the reason why you can have a stator
on<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> engine<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.140> coil<00:01:13.470> or

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
on this engine is because the coil or

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
on this engine is because the coil or
the<00:01:14.070> initial<00:01:14.400> module<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.119> stationed<00:01:15.810> right

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the initial module is stationed right

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340 
the initial module is stationed right
above<00:01:16.650> outside<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> flywheel<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.479> now

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
above outside the flywheel like this now

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.690 
above outside the flywheel like this now
here's<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> flywheel<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> engine

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
here's the flywheel for this engine

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
here's the flywheel for this engine
there<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.210> three<00:01:21.540> magnets<00:01:22.049> glued<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> on

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
there are three magnets glued to it on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.429 
there are three magnets glued to it on
the<00:01:23.159> inside<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.360> goes<00:01:24.600> around<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> stator

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the inside which goes around the stator

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
the inside which goes around the stator
to<00:01:25.710> produce<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> electricity<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.119> power<00:01:27.299> up

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to produce the electricity to power up

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.780 
to produce the electricity to power up
the<00:01:27.540> light<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.770> flywheel<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.490> does

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the light and this flywheel here does

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.810 
the light and this flywheel here does
have<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> magnet<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> outside<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.530> well<00:01:31.820> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
have a magnet on the outside as well so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.080 
have a magnet on the outside as well so
this<00:01:33.119> small<00:01:33.270> part<00:01:33.720> over<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.200> magnetized

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
this small part over here is magnetized

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.460 
this small part over here is magnetized
so<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.390> make<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> nisshin<00:01:37.079> module

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so it can make the nisshin module

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.789 
so it can make the nisshin module
produce<00:01:37.860> spark<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.460> spark<00:01:38.820> plug<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
produce spark for the spark plug so this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.380 
produce spark for the spark plug so this
is<00:01:40.950> how<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> flywheel<00:01:41.610> would<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
is how the flywheel would go on if the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
is how the flywheel would go on if the
shaft<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> engine<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> fly

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
shaft was on the engine and what the fly

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
shaft was on the engine and what the fly
will<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
will set up like this and with the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.100 
will set up like this and with the
ignition<00:01:47.040> module<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> outside<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
ignition module on the outside you can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.899 
ignition module on the outside you can
create<00:01:49.530> power<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.070> your<00:01:50.189> spark<00:01:50.490> plug<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
create power for your spark plug and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.440 
create power for your spark plug and
your<00:01:51.329> lights<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.970> typically<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
your lights and typically this is the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.880 
your lights and typically this is the
kind<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> light<00:01:54.960> bulb<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
kind of light bulb that would go in a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.389 
kind of light bulb that would go in a
snowblower<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> 12<00:01:58.649> volts<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
snowblower it's going to be 12 volts and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.560 
snowblower it's going to be 12 volts and
27<00:02:00.360> watts<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:00.990> fairly<00:02:01.680> low<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:03.329> want<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
27 watts which is fairly low you want to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.350 
27 watts which is fairly low you want to
make<00:02:03.689> sure<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.020> put<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> 27<00:02:04.890> watt<00:02:05.070> bulb<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
make sure you put a 27 watt bulb and a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.270 
make sure you put a 27 watt bulb and a
snow<00:02:06.570> blower<00:02:06.810> usually<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> don't

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
snow blower usually because if you don't

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.790 
snow blower usually because if you don't
have<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> proper<00:02:08.819> bulb<00:02:09.209> they<00:02:10.110> may<00:02:10.319> burn<00:02:10.530> out

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
have the proper bulb they may burn out

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.910 
have the proper bulb they may burn out
or<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.580> may<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:11.940> light<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.300> enough

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
or they may not light up enough

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.620 
or they may not light up enough
now<00:02:14.920> I'm<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.100> talk<00:02:15.340> about<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.850> engine<00:02:16.030> with

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
now I'm gonna talk about the engine with

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
now I'm gonna talk about the engine with
the<00:02:16.660> points<00:02:17.290> now<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> other<00:02:18.459> engine<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.940> showed

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the points now the other engine I showed

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
the points now the other engine I showed
you<00:02:19.330> does<00:02:19.569> not<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.840> points<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.620> condenser

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
you does not have points in a condenser

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.309 
you does not have points in a condenser
that's<00:02:22.000> why<00:02:22.180> there's<00:02:22.390> more<00:02:22.630> room<00:02:22.870> under<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
that's why there's more room under the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.190 
that's why there's more room under the
flywheel<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:24.069> put<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.550> small<00:02:24.819> stator<00:02:25.200> so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
flywheel to put the small stator so

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.380 
flywheel to put the small stator so
basically<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.010> whole<00:02:27.040> magneto<00:02:27.580> system<00:02:28.120> here

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
basically the whole magneto system here

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.380 
basically the whole magneto system here
is<00:02:28.540> taking<00:02:28.990> up<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.140> room<00:02:29.440> first-aider

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
is taking up the room first-aider

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.030 
is taking up the room first-aider
as<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:32.020> there<00:02:32.200> are<00:02:32.290> no<00:02:32.470> bolting

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
as you can see there are no bolting

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.400 
as you can see there are no bolting
holes<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.610> an<00:02:33.670> external<00:02:34.090> ignition<00:02:34.569> module<00:02:35.260> as

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
holes for an external ignition module as

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.710 
holes for an external ignition module as
you<00:02:35.680> saw<00:02:35.890> on<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.340> engine<00:02:36.610> over<00:02:36.970> here<00:02:37.300> this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
you saw on this engine over here this

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.900 
you saw on this engine over here this
engine<00:02:38.110> here<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.560> lot<00:02:38.860> newer<00:02:39.190> than<00:02:39.640> this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
engine here is a lot newer than this

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.370 
engine here is a lot newer than this
engine<00:02:40.300> here<00:02:40.510> that's<00:02:40.750> why<00:02:40.959> it's<00:02:41.110> got<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
engine here that's why it's got the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.710 
engine here that's why it's got the
modifications<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.209> flywheel<00:02:43.420> on

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
modifications to it and the flywheel on

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.690 
modifications to it and the flywheel on
this<00:02:43.870> engine<00:02:44.110> only<00:02:44.560> has<00:02:44.709> two<00:02:44.950> small<00:02:45.220> magnets

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
this engine only has two small magnets

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.060 
this engine only has two small magnets
on<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.880> inside<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.600> does<00:02:47.350> not<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.769> any

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
on the inside it does not have any

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
external ignition module so if you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.380 
external ignition module so if you
wanted<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.310> power<00:02:54.580> up<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.910> light<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.269> your

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
wanted to power up a light on your

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.110 
wanted to power up a light on your
snowblower<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:56.200> using<00:02:56.530> stock<00:02:56.890> parts<00:02:57.280> you

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
snowblower just using stock parts you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.759 
snowblower just using stock parts you
would<00:02:58.269> not<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.660> able<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.319> would<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.590> to

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
would not be able to you would have to

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.160 
would not be able to you would have to
modify<00:03:00.190> some<00:03:00.519> kind<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.819> system<00:03:01.150> yourself<00:03:01.330> you

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
modify some kind of system yourself you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.600 
modify some kind of system yourself you
can<00:03:02.350> maybe<00:03:02.530> power<00:03:02.890> up<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.190> light<00:03:03.370> with<00:03:03.580> a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
can maybe power up a light with a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.070 
can maybe power up a light with a
battery<00:03:04.060> but<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.360> would<00:03:04.510> have<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.750> find<00:03:04.959> a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
battery but you would have to find a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.770 
battery but you would have to find a
system<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.739> recharge<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.340> each<00:03:06.459> time<00:03:06.819> if

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
system to recharge at each time if

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.180 
system to recharge at each time if
you're<00:03:07.989> some<00:03:08.200> lowers<00:03:08.440> capable<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.010> powering

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
you're some lowers capable of powering

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.740 
you're some lowers capable of powering
up<00:03:09.430> light<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:09.910> going<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.120> show<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:10.330> what<00:03:10.630> you

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
up light I'm going to show you what you

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.150 
up light I'm going to show you what you
have<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.019> do<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.350> make<00:03:11.500> sure<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> light

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
have to do to make sure that the light

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.490 
have to do to make sure that the light
will<00:03:12.519> work<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.569> first<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.959> all<00:03:14.050> you'd<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.319> to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
will work so first of all you'd have to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.410 
will work so first of all you'd have to
find<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.950> small<00:03:15.220> wire<00:03:15.430> that's<00:03:15.850> connected<00:03:15.970> to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
find the small wire that's connected to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.270 
find the small wire that's connected to
the<00:03:16.630> stator<00:03:16.959> underneath<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> flywheel<00:03:18.010> that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
the stator underneath the flywheel that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.610 
the stator underneath the flywheel that
comes<00:03:19.030> out<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.420> engine<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.989> it's

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
comes out of the engine and it's

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.050 
comes out of the engine and it's
typically<00:03:21.040> going<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> plug<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:21.820> this

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
typically going to have a plug like this

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.229 
typically going to have a plug like this
and<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.130> engine<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:24.700> right<00:03:24.940> underneath

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
and on this engine it's right underneath

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.000 
and on this engine it's right underneath
the<00:03:25.510> fuel<00:03:25.750> tank<00:03:26.019> it's<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.380> comes<00:03:26.620> out<00:03:26.829> engine

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the fuel tank it's it comes out engine

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.550 
the fuel tank it's it comes out engine
again<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.209> you'd<00:03:28.360> want<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.660> follow<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.230> wire

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
again so you'd want to follow this wire

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.680 
again so you'd want to follow this wire
so<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.370> want<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.760> follow<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.090> all<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.540> way<00:03:31.660> up

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
so you want to follow it all the way up

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.860 
so you want to follow it all the way up
to<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.170> light<00:03:32.350> or<00:03:32.590> install<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.820> wire<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.750> will

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
to the light or install a wire that will

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.660 
to the light or install a wire that will
go<00:03:35.019> up<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.230> handlebars<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.250> light<00:03:36.430> bulb

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
go up the handlebars to the light bulb

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.850 
go up the handlebars to the light bulb
I'm<00:03:37.450> saying<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:37.989> because<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.470> may<00:03:38.650> have<00:03:38.680> a

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
I'm saying this because you may have a

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.430 
I'm saying this because you may have a
snow<00:03:39.130> blower<00:03:39.310> with<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.940> plug<00:03:40.269> or<00:03:40.510> wire<00:03:40.810> but

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
snow blower with that plug or wire but

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.110 
snow blower with that plug or wire but
you<00:03:41.530> don't<00:03:41.769> have<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:41.950> light<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.310> your<00:03:42.430> blower<00:03:42.670> so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
you don't have a light on your blower so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.630 
you don't have a light on your blower so
you<00:03:43.209> have<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.600> install<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.140> wire<00:03:44.440> bring<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.519> up

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
you have to install a wire bring it up

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.699 
you have to install a wire bring it up
to<00:03:45.790> where<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.090> light<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.750> I've<00:03:47.440> got<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
to where the light is and I've got the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.110 
to where the light is and I've got the
blower<00:03:47.920> tipped<00:03:48.190> over<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.609> show<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.970> better

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
blower tipped over to show you a better

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.530 
blower tipped over to show you a better
view

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
view

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.310 
view
here's<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.590> black<00:03:50.920> wire<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.720> would<00:03:52.930> connect

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
here's that black wire it would connect

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.400 
here's that black wire it would connect
one<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.769> prongs<00:03:54.100> on<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.700> light<00:03:54.910> bulb<00:03:55.120> and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
one of the prongs on the light bulb and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.500 
one of the prongs on the light bulb and
on<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.620> other<00:03:56.769> prong<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.579> light<00:03:57.910> bulb<00:03:58.209> it

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
on the other prong of the light bulb it

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.900 
on the other prong of the light bulb it
would<00:03:58.660> be<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.840> ground<00:03:59.170> wire<00:03:59.590> in<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.280> case<00:04:00.579> the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
would be a ground wire in this case the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.750 
would be a ground wire in this case the
green<00:04:01.180> one<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:02.140> ground<00:04:02.650> wire<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.310> would<00:04:03.549> just

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
green one is a ground wire it would just

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.849 
green one is a ground wire it would just
basically<00:04:03.880> connect<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.200> metal<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:05.709> your

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
basically connect to the metal on your

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.920 
basically connect to the metal on your
snowblower<00:04:06.280> now<00:04:07.120> because<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.450> lot<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.690> some

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
snowblower now because a lot of some

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.599 
snowblower now because a lot of some
blowers<00:04:08.230> have<00:04:08.380> plastic<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.160> them<00:04:09.400> make<00:04:09.579> sure

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
blowers have plastic on them make sure

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.400 
blowers have plastic on them make sure
that<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.030> metal<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.450> ground<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.200> ground

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
that the metal you ground the ground

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.340 
that the metal you ground the ground
wire<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:12.359> actually<00:04:13.359> follows<00:04:13.780> right<00:04:14.049> through

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
wire to actually follows right through

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.590 
wire to actually follows right through
to<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.799> engine<00:04:15.220> it's<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.120> only<00:04:16.329> way<00:04:16.570> that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
to the engine it's the only way that

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.409 
to the engine it's the only way that
your<00:04:16.930> lights<00:04:17.169> going<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.500> work<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.180> by<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.239> way

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
your lights going to work and by the way

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.969 
your lights going to work and by the way
that's<00:04:19.630> what<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.989> two<00:04:20.140> little<00:04:20.320> prongs<00:04:20.650> look

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
that's what the two little prongs look

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.159 
that's what the two little prongs look
like<00:04:21.190> inside<00:04:21.640> some<00:04:22.180> snow<00:04:22.419> blowers<00:04:22.750> will<00:04:22.960> come

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
like inside some snow blowers will come

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.500 
like inside some snow blowers will come
with<00:04:23.320> an<00:04:23.470> actual<00:04:23.830> plug<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.580> some<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.390> them

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
with an actual plug and some of them

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.060 
with an actual plug and some of them
just<00:04:25.539> have<00:04:25.930> two<00:04:26.140> wires<00:04:26.409> with<00:04:26.800> two

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
just have two wires with two

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.180 
just have two wires with two
small<00:04:27.370> terminal<00:04:27.910> connectors<00:04:28.510> on<00:04:28.720> them<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:29.190> like

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
small terminal connectors on them I like

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.760 
small terminal connectors on them I like
using<00:04:30.460> these<00:04:30.760> plugs<00:04:31.150> here<00:04:31.630> they<00:04:32.170> keep<00:04:32.410> out<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
using these plugs here they keep out the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.680 
using these plugs here they keep out the
water<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.670> terminals<00:04:34.150> don't<00:04:34.420> get<00:04:34.570> all

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
water and the terminals don't get all

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.200 
water and the terminals don't get all
rusted<00:04:35.170> and<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.400> connects<00:04:36.760> right<00:04:37.000> in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
rusted and it just connects right in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.960 
rusted and it just connects right in
there

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
there

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.340 
there
these<00:04:39.970> are<00:04:40.120> actually<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.570> best<00:04:40.750> plugs<00:04:41.110> for

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
these are actually the best plugs for

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.720 
these are actually the best plugs for
this<00:04:41.530> kind<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.830> application<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:45.250> when<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.430> see

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
this kind of application so when I see

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.100 
this kind of application so when I see
that<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:45.970> wires<00:04:46.150> are<00:04:46.360> defective<00:04:46.870> on<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
that the wires are defective on the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.900 
that the wires are defective on the
snowblower<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:47.980> what<00:04:48.190> I<00:04:48.220> replace<00:04:48.700> them

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
snowblower this is what I replace them

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.720 
snowblower this is what I replace them
with<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:50.560> that's<00:04:50.740> what<00:04:50.980> all<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.250> information
