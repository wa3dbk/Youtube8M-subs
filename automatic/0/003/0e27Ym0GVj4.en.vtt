the brain is a master connector and most
of<00:00:21.750> us<00:00:21.840> would<00:00:22.050> say<00:00:22.080> that's<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.770> no-brainer<00:00:22.980> when

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
of us would say that's a no-brainer when

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.250 
of us would say that's a no-brainer when
it<00:00:23.730> comes<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.180> mental<00:00:24.540> and<00:00:24.720> intellectual

it comes to mental and intellectual

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.830 
it comes to mental and intellectual

you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.070 

so<00:01:48.650> really<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.370> are<00:01:49.610> looking<00:01:50.510> at<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.840> brain

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
so really you are looking at the brain

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.370 
so really you are looking at the brain
as<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.470> social<00:01:52.040> organ<00:01:52.660> absolutely<00:01:53.660> yeah<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.260> I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
as a social organ absolutely yeah and I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.830 
as a social organ absolutely yeah and I
think<00:01:54.440> that's<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.980> reason<00:01:55.370> why<00:01:55.610> we've<00:01:56.390> had<00:01:56.420> we

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
think that's the reason why we've had we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.750 
think that's the reason why we've had we
have<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.170> much<00:01:57.290> trouble<00:01:57.650> studying<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.550> brain

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
have so much trouble studying the brain

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.520 
have so much trouble studying the brain
or<00:01:58.910> understanding<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.540> brain<00:01:59.840> from<00:02:00.440> a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
or understanding the brain from a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.580 
or understanding the brain from a
Western<00:02:00.950> medical<00:02:01.490> model<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.150> science<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.140> that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
Western medical model of science is that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.160 
Western medical model of science is that
researchers<00:02:04.520> take<00:02:04.820> brains<00:02:05.450> individual

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
researchers take brains individual

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.560 
researchers take brains individual
brains<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.770> analyze<00:02:07.760> them<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.060> scan<00:02:08.390> them

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
brains and analyze them and scan them

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.410 
brains and analyze them and scan them
and<00:02:08.720> dissect<00:02:09.110> them<00:02:09.290> but<00:02:10.220> brains<00:02:10.610> are<00:02:10.940> social

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
and dissect them but brains are social

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.300 
and dissect them but brains are social
organs<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:11.930> can<00:02:12.050> only<00:02:12.200> really<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.650> understood

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
organs and can only really be understood

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.340 
organs and can only really be understood
when<00:02:14.120> they're<00:02:14.300> connected<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.870> other<00:02:15.020> brains

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
when they're connected to other brains

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.240 
when they're connected to other brains
so<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.400> sense<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.790> harkens<00:02:17.150> back<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:18.250> to

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
so in a sense it harkens back to the to

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.310 
so in a sense it harkens back to the to
the<00:02:19.520> field<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.940> psychoneuroimmunology<00:02:20.480> and

the role of relationship and health it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.530 
the role of relationship and health it
harkens<00:02:24.500> back<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.740> family's<00:02:25.460> family<00:02:25.970> therapy

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
harkens back to family's family therapy

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.380 
harkens back to family's family therapy

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
that looked at the individual pathology

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.910 
that looked at the individual pathology
as<00:02:31.340> an<00:02:31.490> expression<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.590> dysregulation<00:02:33.590> and

what's going on in the brain when the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.770 
what's going on in the brain when the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.320 
baby and the parents are going through
that<00:03:18.019> dance<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.739> psychological<00:03:19.489> atonement

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.430 
or lack of atonement with each other
well<00:03:22.670> probably<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.300> start<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.870> mean<00:03:23.989> remember

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
well probably to start I mean remember

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.960 
well probably to start I mean remember
what<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.590> said<00:03:24.769> before<00:03:24.890> is<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.250> for<00:03:25.550> primates

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
what I said before is that for primates

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.000 
what I said before is that for primates
attachment<00:03:26.690> equals<00:03:26.989> survival<00:03:27.739> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
attachment equals survival and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.920 
attachment equals survival and
abandonment<00:03:28.880> equals<00:03:29.269> death<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.660> mean<00:03:29.810> it's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
abandonment equals death I mean it's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.780 
abandonment equals death I mean it's
also<00:03:30.050> true<00:03:30.350> for<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.890> know<00:03:30.980> for<00:03:31.370> most<00:03:31.519> mammals

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
also true for you know for most mammals

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.300 
also true for you know for most mammals
as<00:03:32.209> well<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.900> what<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.650> even<00:03:34.010> at<00:03:34.130> eight

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310

at eight months of gestation before
we're<00:03:36.230> even<00:03:36.260> born<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:37.670> have<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> part<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:38.360> the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
brain a core part of the brain called

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.729 
brain a core part of the brain called
the<00:03:40.070> amygdala<00:03:40.610> which<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:42.350> sort<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.590> the

the amygdala which is the sort of the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.460 
the amygdala which is the sort of the
it's<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.400> executive<00:03:43.730> Centre<00:03:44.480> for<00:03:44.989> fear

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
it's the executive Centre for fear

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.490 
it's the executive Centre for fear
activation<00:03:46.160> it's<00:03:46.970> fully<00:03:47.330> developed<00:03:47.870> by<00:03:48.320> eight

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500

activation it's fully developed by eight
months<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.830> gestation<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.640> by<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:49.910> time<00:03:50.150> we're

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390

months of gestation so by the time we're
born

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
born

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.780

we're capable of being completely
terrified<00:03:53.530> right<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.920> might<00:03:55.070> notice

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
terrified right and you might notice

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.789 
terrified right and you might notice
when<00:03:55.910> you<00:03:56.030> look<00:03:56.060> at<00:03:56.389> young<00:03:56.690> children<00:03:56.799> when

when you look at young children when

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.259 
when you look at young children when
they<00:03:57.950> have<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> fear<00:03:58.489> response<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:59.180> a

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
they have a fear response it's a

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.940 
they have a fear response it's a
full-body<00:03:59.630> response<00:04:00.170> there<00:04:00.410> over<00:04:00.680> where

it's<00:04:01.220> kind<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.400> like<00:04:01.550> a<00:04:01.580> panic<00:04:01.970> attack

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
it's kind of like a panic attack

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.820 
it's kind of like a panic attack
whenever<00:04:03.020> then<00:04:03.230> we<00:04:03.349> know<00:04:03.470> when<00:04:03.650> they're

early<00:04:35.810> on<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.410> know<00:04:36.590> when<00:04:36.740> we're<00:04:36.919> born

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
early on and you know when we're born

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.700 
early on and you know when we're born
and<00:04:37.490> for<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:38.030> for<00:04:38.300> many<00:04:38.810> years<00:04:39.169> many<00:04:39.440> of<00:04:39.590> our

and for and for many years many of our
early<00:04:39.979> years<00:04:40.220> we<00:04:40.850> use<00:04:41.150> our<00:04:41.540> parents<00:04:42.320> frontal

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
early years we use our parents frontal

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.900 
early years we use our parents frontal
lobes<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:43.850> sense<00:04:44.120> as<00:04:44.300> an<00:04:45.169> external<00:04:45.830> as<00:04:46.370> an

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
external prosthetic brain so are we

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.840 
external prosthetic brain so are we
depend<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:51.139> our<00:04:51.290> parent<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.919> be<00:04:52.040> sensitive<00:04:52.610> to

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850

us<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.840> mirror<00:04:54.410> us<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:55.400> see<00:04:55.790> when<00:04:56.180> we're

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
us to mirror us to see when we're

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.300 
us to mirror us to see when we're
heading<00:04:56.720> for<00:04:56.930> danger<00:04:57.350> or<00:04:57.500> when<00:04:57.710> we're<00:04:57.889> upset

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
heading for danger or when we're upset

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.430 
heading for danger or when we're upset
and<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:59.150> we<00:04:59.270> had<00:04:59.450> these<00:04:59.600> experiences<00:05:00.290> of

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
and so we had these experiences of

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.340 
and so we had these experiences of
getting<00:05:00.740> upset<00:05:00.919> our<00:05:01.310> parents<00:05:02.090> step<00:05:02.300> in<00:05:02.570> they

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
getting upset our parents step in they

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.260 
getting upset our parents step in they
help<00:05:03.650> us<00:05:03.800> reregulate<00:05:04.190> whether<00:05:04.700> we're<00:05:04.940> hungry

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
help us reregulate whether we're hungry

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.730 
help us reregulate whether we're hungry
or<00:05:05.419> wet<00:05:05.630> or<00:05:05.660> frightened<00:05:06.169> or<00:05:06.260> whatever<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.710> is

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
or wet or frightened or whatever it is

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.000 
or wet or frightened or whatever it is
and<00:05:07.070> then<00:05:08.000> we<00:05:08.180> go<00:05:08.360> back<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.169> baseline<00:05:09.590> to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
and then we go back to a baseline to

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.159 
and then we go back to a baseline to
being<00:05:10.220> calm<00:05:10.490> again<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:11.030> it's<00:05:11.930> these

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
being calm again and it's these

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.840 
being calm again and it's these
thousands<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.010> thousands<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.550> interactions

being with our parents our sensitivity

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.040 
being with our parents our sensitivity
to<00:05:37.250> them<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.850> their<00:05:37.970> sensitivity<00:05:38.390> to<00:05:38.900> us

to them and their sensitivity to us

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.800 
to them and their sensitivity to us
right<00:05:39.680> what's<00:05:40.400> happening<00:05:40.910> is<00:05:41.120> that<00:05:41.150> these

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
right what's happening is that these

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.750 
right what's happening is that these
networks<00:05:42.140> between<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.950> amygdala<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.669> the

prefrontal<00:05:44.120> cortex<00:05:44.510> are<00:05:45.320> slowly<00:05:45.950> being

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
prefrontal cortex are slowly being

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.730 
prefrontal cortex are slowly being
shaped<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.210> they're<00:05:47.539> modeling<00:05:48.080> on<00:05:48.320> these

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
shaped and they're modeling on these

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.400 
shaped and they're modeling on these
interactions<00:05:49.430> with<00:05:49.580> parents<00:05:49.870> so<00:05:50.870> this<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.200> one

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
interactions with parents so this is one

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.340 
interactions with parents so this is one
of<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.590> ways<00:05:51.800> in<00:05:52.130> which<00:05:52.479> parenting<00:05:53.479> affects
