here<00:01:01.370> here<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.490> have<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.060> rear<00:01:04.019> shock<00:01:04.379> tower

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
here here we have the rear shock tower

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.330 
here here we have the rear shock tower
it<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.479> plastic<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.259> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.829> get<00:01:08.070> them

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it is plastic but you can get them

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.240 
it is plastic but you can get them
aluminium<00:01:08.759> upgrade<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.200> break<00:01:10.439> them<00:01:10.740> they

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
aluminium upgrade we do break them they

the<00:01:17.100> rear<00:01:17.370> diff<00:01:17.730> box<00:01:19.700> now<00:01:20.700> moving<00:01:21.300> on<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the rear diff box now moving on all of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.490 
the rear diff box now moving on all of
this<00:01:22.260> tray<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:24.240> goes<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.140> front

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this tray here that goes from the front

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
this tray here that goes from the front
I<00:01:25.880> mean<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.300> front<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.140> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
I mean from the front to the back this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.380 
I mean from the front to the back this
one<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.750> metal<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.490> metal<00:01:33.090> tray

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
one is metal all of this is a metal tray
