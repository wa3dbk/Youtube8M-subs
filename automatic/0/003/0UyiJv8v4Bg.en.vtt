00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
make this thing completely your

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.130 
make this thing completely your
screwdriver<00:01:37.700> or<00:01:37.909> whatever<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.600> want<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.930> call

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
screwdriver or whatever you want to call

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.469 
screwdriver or whatever you want to call
it<00:01:39.640> its<00:01:40.840> guts<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.609> think<00:01:43.609> the<00:01:43.789> thing<00:01:43.939> said<00:01:44.210> over

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
it its guts I think the thing said over

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.660 
it its guts I think the thing said over
five<00:01:44.929> thousand<00:01:45.619> possibilities<00:01:45.859> when<00:01:46.579> you

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
five thousand possibilities when you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.020 
five thousand possibilities when you
combine<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.210> them<00:01:47.450> together<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:49.030> whenever

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
combine all of them together so whenever

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.719 
combine all of them together so whenever
you<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:51.950> my<00:01:52.159> screwdriver

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
you get here like with my screwdriver

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.169 
you get here like with my screwdriver
I'm<00:01:52.909> right<00:01:53.119> here<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.859> change<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.820> effect

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
I'm right here you can change the effect

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.789 
I'm right here you can change the effect
by<00:01:56.450> moving<00:01:56.719> it<00:01:56.960> up<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.409> down<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.670> actual

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
by moving it up and down on the actual

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.190 
by moving it up and down on the actual
screwdriver<00:02:00.799> itself<00:02:01.249> so

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.830 

increase<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.310> pitch<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.729> range<00:02:07.000> here<00:02:07.420> and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
increase the pitch and range here and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.970 
increase the pitch and range here and
lower<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.950> by<00:02:09.729> dragging<00:02:10.090> down<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.860> a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
lower it by dragging down that's a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.619 
lower it by dragging down that's a
feature<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.370> can<00:02:12.459> turn<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.120> off<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.300> like

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
feature you can turn on and off and like

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.869 
feature you can turn on and off and like
I<00:02:13.660> said<00:02:13.810> there's<00:02:14.200> different<00:02:14.680> effects<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
I said there's different effects and

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.580 
I said there's different effects and
everything<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.629> come<00:02:16.810> out<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.170> tip<00:02:17.379> so

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
everything that come out of the tip so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.009
