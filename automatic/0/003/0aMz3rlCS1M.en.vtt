hey<00:00:14.320> you're<00:00:14.500> watching<00:00:14.770> question<00:00:15.100> tutorials

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
hey you're watching question tutorials

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.190 
hey you're watching question tutorials
and<00:00:15.940> today<00:00:16.209> we're<00:00:16.660> going<00:00:16.720> to<00:00:16.840> learn<00:00:16.960> how<00:00:17.020> to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
and today we're going to learn how to

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.410 
and today we're going to learn how to
solve<00:00:17.470> a<00:00:17.680> rubik's<00:00:17.980> cube<00:00:18.279> now<00:00:18.880> this<00:00:19.300> is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
solve a rubik's cube now this is

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.240 
solve a rubik's cube now this is
something<00:00:19.599> really<00:00:19.930> awesome<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.529> everyone

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
something really awesome that everyone

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.550 
something really awesome that everyone
can<00:00:21.369> learn<00:00:21.599> but<00:00:22.599> I'll<00:00:22.779> say<00:00:22.930> it<00:00:22.960> right<00:00:23.140> now<00:00:23.290> that

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
can learn but I'll say it right now that

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.260 
can learn but I'll say it right now that
it<00:00:23.650> does<00:00:23.770> take<00:00:24.009> a<00:00:24.040> lot<00:00:24.250> of<00:00:24.310> time<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.910> patience

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
it does take a lot of time and patience

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.630 
it does take a lot of time and patience
initially<00:00:25.779> but<00:00:26.560> after<00:00:26.919> you<00:00:27.009> solve<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.399> cube

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
initially but after you solve the cube

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.490 
initially but after you solve the cube
over<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:28.090> over<00:00:28.180> again<00:00:28.419> you<00:00:29.140> know<00:00:29.259> eventually

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
over and over again you know eventually

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.170 
over and over again you know eventually
go<00:00:29.739> into<00:00:29.770> your<00:00:30.040> muscle<00:00:30.279> memory<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.849> you<00:00:31.029> won't

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
go into your muscle memory and you won't

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.940 
go into your muscle memory and you won't
answer<00:00:31.300> memorize<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.869> steps<00:00:32.079> anymore<00:00:32.439> if

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
answer memorize the steps anymore if

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.319 
answer memorize the steps anymore if
you're<00:00:33.100> subscribed<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.610> this<00:00:33.700> channel<00:00:33.760> you

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
you're subscribed to this channel you

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.030 
you're subscribed to this channel you
can<00:00:34.690> see<00:00:34.870> that<00:00:34.899> I've<00:00:35.140> done<00:00:35.260> this<00:00:35.350> tutorial<00:00:35.890> and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
can see that I've done this tutorial and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.130 
can see that I've done this tutorial and
four<00:00:36.280> videos<00:00:36.610> I<00:00:36.940> can't<00:00:37.690> predict<00:00:37.960> how<00:00:38.079> long

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
four videos I can't predict how long

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.410 
four videos I can't predict how long
they're<00:00:38.590> going<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.829> be<00:00:38.950> it<00:00:39.160> but<00:00:40.030> I'm<00:00:40.210> going<00:00:40.329> to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
they're going to be it but I'm going to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.689 
they're going to be it but I'm going to
try<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.600> teach<00:00:40.840> them<00:00:41.020> as<00:00:41.140> slowly<00:00:41.380> as<00:00:41.620> possible

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
try to teach them as slowly as possible

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.459 
try to teach them as slowly as possible
because<00:00:42.699> when<00:00:43.179> I<00:00:43.210> solve<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.600> cube<00:00:43.809> at<00:00:44.140> my<00:00:44.289> own

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
because when I solve the cube at my own

00:00:44.469 --> 00:01:40.960 
because when I solve the cube at my own
pace<00:00:44.710> it<00:00:45.100> looks<00:00:45.579> like<00:00:45.670> this

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.770 

for<00:01:41.970> those<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> who<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.570> already

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
for those of you who are already

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
for those of you who are already
familiar<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> Rubik's<00:01:43.979> Cube<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.460> some

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
familiar with the Rubik's Cube and some

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.030 
familiar with the Rubik's Cube and some
of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.940> terminology<00:01:45.710> what<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.830> going<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
of the terminology what I'm going to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
of the terminology what I'm going to
teach<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:48.330> modified<00:01:48.990> version<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.410> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
teach is a modified version of the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.740 
teach is a modified version of the
layer-by-layer<00:01:49.710> method<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.540> main

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
layer-by-layer method with the main

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.900 
layer-by-layer method with the main
difference<00:01:52.170> being<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.160> cube<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> foot

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
difference being that the cube is foot

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.870 
difference being that the cube is foot
pretty<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.630> upside<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:56.580> will<00:01:56.700> help

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty much upside down this will help

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
pretty much upside down this will help
you<00:01:57.030> later<00:01:57.300> when<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> learn<00:01:58.110> more

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you later when you want to learn more

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490 
you later when you want to learn more
advanced<00:01:58.830> methods<00:01:59.190> like<00:01:59.280> f2l<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.750> for

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
advanced methods like f2l because for

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.809 
advanced methods like f2l because for
Speed<00:02:01.679> solving<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.250> pretty<00:02:02.429> much<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.789> to

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
Speed solving you pretty much have to

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.850 
Speed solving you pretty much have to
put<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.090> key<00:02:03.300> opps<00:02:03.479> i<00:02:03.569> never<00:02:03.720> do<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.080> you'll

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
put the key opps i never do it you'll

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.240 
put the key opps i never do it you'll
see<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.160> mean

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
see what i mean

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.719 
see what i mean
for<00:02:06.970> everyone<00:02:07.540> else<00:02:08.460> basically<00:02:09.460> what<00:02:09.610> we're

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
for everyone else basically what we're

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.210 
for everyone else basically what we're
going<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.940> do<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.660> we're<00:02:11.350> going<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.740> solve<00:02:12.040> this

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
going to do is we're going to solve this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.450 
going to do is we're going to solve this
cube<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.880> different<00:02:13.540> parts<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.680> first<00:02:15.280> we're

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
cube a different parts so first we're

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.040 
cube a different parts so first we're
going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> get<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> cross<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.480> side<00:02:16.720> and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
going to get a cross on one side and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.770 
going to get a cross on one side and
then<00:02:17.680> we're<00:02:18.070> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.370> solve<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:19.270> entire

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
then we're going to solve the entire

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.140 
then we're going to solve the entire
side<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:21.130> then<00:02:21.340> we're<00:02:21.430> going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.610> solve<00:02:21.760> parts

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
side and then we're going to solve parts

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.140 
side and then we're going to solve parts
of<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.870> rest<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> queue<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.730> solves

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
of the rest of the queue and it solves

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.000 
of the rest of the queue and it solves
the<00:02:25.330> top<00:02:25.570> part<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.680> we're<00:02:26.830> going<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the top part and then we're going to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
the top part and then we're going to
tell<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.310> rest<00:02:27.459> they<00:02:27.610> keep<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.910> family<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.750> this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
tell the rest they keep a family in this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
tell the rest they keep a family in this
first<00:02:29.170> video<00:02:29.350> I'm<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> teach<00:02:30.550> you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
first video I'm just going to teach you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.300 
first video I'm just going to teach you
how<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.330> cross<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.959> how<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> solve<00:02:32.650> one

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
how to make a cross and how to solve one

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.330 
how to make a cross and how to solve one
soul<00:02:33.580> outside<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.890> we're<00:02:35.890> going<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.130> use

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
soul outside and we're going to use

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.690 
soul outside and we're going to use
white<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.450> yellow<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.709> video<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.550> because

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
white and yellow this video just because

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.720 
white and yellow this video just because
that's<00:02:40.060> what<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:40.270> used<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.980> yeah<00:02:42.400> we're<00:02:42.700> not

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
that's what I used to so yeah we're not

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.830 
that's what I used to so yeah we're not
going<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.390> let's<00:02:44.020> scare<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.470> into<00:02:44.560> it
