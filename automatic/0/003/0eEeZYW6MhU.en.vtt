00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.189
 The story of disturbing love I 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.549
 East Memorial High School I East Memorial to him 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.719
 I had a long dry and a playoff 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.490
 They brought in coach Scott Phillips and they actually started playing better 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.539
 Scott Phillips finds himself suddenly surprised 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.590
 In the cold because when he was hired he was in part 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.449
 He loved the written contract that he signed to be appointed but was told 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.869
 You gotta start coming to our church not to the other church that you go to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.829
 He said that it must be the sports director as a member 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.860
 Revas Memorial Baptist Church 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.520
 Phillips said in fact I was 30 seconds of turning the task down because if it was 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.930
 The 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 The version they wanted me to move from the Church of the Highlands to the East 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.090
 Memorial 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.160
 I did not really like it and I told them I was willing to give it a try 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.129
 But I do not know how it will work out for one year Phillips whole family 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.770
 I went to all the churches she would go on Sunday at 9 am to the East Memorial 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.449
 Then at 11 am and up to his church the former Church of the Highlands 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.650
 Again it was not documented anywhere in politics but it was one of those things 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 It has been released very very clearly to Scott Phillips 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.740
 When asked% uh the school why it is only in it 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.990
 The response was part of the contract 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.780
 Terms of contract employment or career prospects are confidential 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.979
 Information that can not be discussed Philips wrote back and said you know 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.079
 This really does not work for me it just does not work 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.659
 He did not hear from school officials about it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.790
 He then ended up resigning 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.119
 After saying that they will not succumb to their policy of just letting him go to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.520
 for him 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.369
 The original church I understand we can have a good debate about 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.630
 It was kind of said up front but nothing really was that it happened 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.299
 It was really binding in any kind of traditional sense 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.920
 I do not really want to have this conversation conversation I want to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.500
 Be it 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.450
 Christ is interested in politics 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.180
 Or it would have been really shot but it was to force a man out 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.520
 Because it is not a member of your church's specific love 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.020
 And remember that nothing is not part of your religion we know about launching 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.640
 People because they are completely wrong religion 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.500
 This is one of Jesus' true followers that he only follows in a different church 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.720
 It is that Christ is such a representative indeed 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.160
 I love I do not know what we can even call it in good faith Christianity 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.860
 I'm not really sure what the term would be if this is what they do to Christians 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.620
 Which goes to other churches 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.360
 What do Jewish atheists do not even have one bullet in 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.319
 Being contracted 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.769
 The East Memorial is very, very, very annoying here 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.170
 I think it probably was a problem 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.250
 It was a problem for Scott Phillips to be told this was not in writing he was kinda 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.900
 agreed 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.349
 He can criticize him for it but this crisis is like Christ I would say 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.760
 You gotta follow Jesus not only in your church but you've got to do it in 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.840
 Our church is very, very stuffy 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.370
 Let's take a break out next we'll talk to Zach Kopplin and then later on 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.870
