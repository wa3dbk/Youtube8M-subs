00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
completely smooth so I'm going to show

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
completely smooth so I'm going to show
you<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> technique<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.350> start<00:01:29.040> by<00:01:29.220> doing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you the technique I use I start by doing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520 
you the technique I use I start by doing
a<00:01:29.549> small<00:01:29.880> twist<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> root<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> ensure

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
a small twist at the root just to ensure

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560 
a small twist at the root just to ensure
that<00:01:31.560> they'll<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:32.040> straight<00:01:32.520> once<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> dries<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that they'll be straight once it dries I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.140 
that they'll be straight once it dries I
then<00:01:34.140> place<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.439> finger<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> top<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
then place one finger on the top of the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
then place one finger on the top of the
hook<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.990> push<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> coral<00:01:37.770> former<00:01:38.070> upwards

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
hook as I push the coral former upwards

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.149 
hook as I push the coral former upwards
so<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> covers<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> entire<00:01:39.930> hook<00:01:40.470> then

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so that it covers the entire hook then

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
so that it covers the entire hook then
using<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.729> pumping<00:01:42.119> motion<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.689> pull<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> rod

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
using a pumping motion I pull the rod

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039 
using a pumping motion I pull the rod
downwards<00:01:44.430> while<00:01:44.909> pushing<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> curlformer

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
downwards while pushing the curlformer

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
downwards while pushing the curlformer
up<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:47.070> helps<00:01:47.399> relieve<00:01:47.729> some<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
up and down which helps relieve some of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.020 
up and down which helps relieve some of
the<00:01:48.149> tension<00:01:48.180> from<00:01:49.049> pulling<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.560> rod<00:01:50.030> once

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the tension from pulling the rod once

it's<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.619> simple<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:57.710> okay<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.250> see

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's as simple as that okay let's see

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219 
it's as simple as that okay let's see
that<00:01:59.610> technique<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.240> more<00:02:00.450> time<00:02:00.659> you're

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that technique one more time you're

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
that technique one more time you're
going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> load<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.890> curlformer<00:02:02.490> onto<00:02:03.090> your

rod sliding it all the way down until
you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> hook<00:02:06.509> peeking<00:02:07.049> out<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> top

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
you can see the hook peeking out the top

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.550 
you can see the hook peeking out the top
next<00:02:09.549> take<00:02:10.090> one<00:02:10.269> your<00:02:10.420> twist<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.929> section<00:02:11.500> on

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
next take one your twist and section on

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.500 
next take one your twist and section on
a<00:02:11.590> smaller<00:02:11.980> section<00:02:12.310> ensuring<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.060> all<00:02:13.360> the

a smaller section ensuring that all the
tangles<00:02:13.870> are<00:02:14.019> smoothed<00:02:14.349> out<00:02:15.959> then<00:02:16.959> take<00:02:17.349> your

this so a kind of logistical tip since
you<00:02:45.430> only<00:02:45.609> have<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.940> 40<00:02:46.239> curlformers<00:02:46.840> I

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
you only have the 40 curlformers I

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.960 
you only have the 40 curlformers I
section<00:02:47.470> my<00:02:47.560> hair<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:48.010> four<00:02:48.280> parts<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.819> make

section my hair into four parts to make

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.670 
section my hair into four parts to make
sure<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.269> only<00:02:49.450> use<00:02:49.659> ten<00:02:49.930> per<00:02:50.109> section<00:02:50.530> I

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
sure that I only use ten per section I

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.619 
sure that I only use ten per section I
start<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.639> front<00:02:51.790> when<00:02:52.060> my<00:02:52.180> hair<00:02:52.389> is<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
start in the front when my hair is the

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.839 
start in the front when my hair is the
less<00:02:52.870> dense<00:02:53.109> because<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:53.829> always<00:02:54.129> end<00:02:54.549> up<00:02:54.609> using

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
less dense because I always end up using

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.430 
less dense because I always end up using
less<00:02:55.000> here<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.629> can<00:02:55.870> use<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.139> extra

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
less here and can use the extra

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.899 
less here and can use the extra
curlformers<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.280> back<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.730> crown

one<00:04:27.680> thing<00:04:27.920> I<00:04:28.010> forgot<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.310> mention<00:04:28.520> when<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.880> was

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
one thing I forgot to mention when I was

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.150 
one thing I forgot to mention when I was
installing<00:04:29.360> them<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.140> usually<00:04:30.560> place

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
installing them is that I usually place

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.310 
installing them is that I usually place
the<00:04:31.610> orange<00:04:32.030> ones<00:04:32.240> in<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.540> back<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.990> my<00:04:33.110> head

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
the orange ones in the back of my head

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.260 
the orange ones in the back of my head
because<00:04:34.010> they're<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.310> wider<00:04:34.580> ones<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.210> I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
because they're the wider ones and I

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.360 
because they're the wider ones and I
place<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.660> pink<00:04:35.960> ones<00:04:36.200> in<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.920> front<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.280> my

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
place the pink ones in the front of my

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.070 
place the pink ones in the front of my
head<00:04:37.520> because<00:04:37.700> they're<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.360> smaller<00:04:38.780> ones

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
head because they're the smaller ones

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.260 
head because they're the smaller ones
but<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.830> haven't<00:04:40.100> used<00:04:40.430> these<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:40.820> while<00:04:41.000> and

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
but I haven't used these in a while and

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.930 
but I haven't used these in a while and
I<00:04:41.330> totally<00:04:41.690> forgot<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:42.860> don't<00:04:43.730> make<00:04:43.880> that

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
I totally forgot that so don't make that

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.800 
I totally forgot that so don't make that
same<00:04:44.240> mistake

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
same mistake

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.900 
same mistake
so<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.770> verify<00:04:46.130> that<00:04:46.340> they're<00:04:46.490> all<00:04:46.640> dry

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
so just verify that they're all dry

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.890 
so just verify that they're all dry
because<00:04:47.090> you<00:04:47.180> can<00:04:47.360> always<00:04:47.450> just<00:04:47.630> go<00:04:47.750> back

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
because you can always just go back

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.450 
because you can always just go back
under<00:04:48.140> your<00:04:48.230> hooded<00:04:48.500> dryer<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:49.010> then

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
under your hooded dryer and then

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.040 
under your hooded dryer and then
depending<00:04:49.910> on<00:04:50.000> what<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.420> like<00:04:50.600> in<00:04:50.780> terms<00:04:50.990> of

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
depending on what you like in terms of

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.230 
depending on what you like in terms of
your<00:04:51.200> style<00:04:51.440> just<00:04:51.560> go<00:04:51.980> in<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.550> separate<00:04:53.060> the

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
your style just go in and separate the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.320 
your style just go in and separate the
curls<00:04:53.480> into<00:04:53.840> smaller<00:04:54.320> sections<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:55.270> tend<00:04:56.270> to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
curls into smaller sections I tend to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.180 
curls into smaller sections I tend to
like<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.750> little<00:04:57.020> frizz<00:04:57.260> in<00:04:57.440> my<00:04:57.530> hair<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:57.980> the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
like a little frizz in my hair and the

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.130 
like a little frizz in my hair and the
more<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:58.610> separate<00:04:59.060> them<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.600> more<00:04:59.810> frizz

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
more you separate them the more frizz

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.230 
more you separate them the more frizz
you're<00:05:00.290> going<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.590> get<00:05:00.740> but<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.490> avoid<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:02.000> as

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
you're going to get but to avoid that as

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.300 
you're going to get but to avoid that as
you<00:05:02.390> can<00:05:02.480> see<00:05:02.540> here<00:05:03.020> with<00:05:03.320> each<00:05:03.530> curl<00:05:03.860> I'm<00:05:04.100> kind

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
you can see here with each curl I'm kind

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.980 
you can see here with each curl I'm kind
of<00:05:04.370> just<00:05:04.580> twisting<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.090> around<00:05:05.150> my<00:05:05.480> finger<00:05:05.810> to

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
of just twisting it around my finger to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.060
