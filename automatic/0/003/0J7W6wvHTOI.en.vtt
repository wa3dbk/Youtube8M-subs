 new video you see the challenge is 4 we are 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.420
 right now in second division with 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.610
 right now I mean in this video not 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.139
 after the video and you see how I 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.790
 saco with alexis sanchez one of the things 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.580
 what I wanted to point out is that alexis sanchez 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 the touch I honestly put it on 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.539
 decorate you see that taken out in plan 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.460
 cheese tells me the team around 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.140
 this soriano east buckle and said 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 Well, I'm going to wear alexis before 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.350
 that I have over 900,000 coins already 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 to have a total but only for 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 decorate such because the alignment me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
 I went out to put alexis sanchez in the middle 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 right and I sincerely the media 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 right never never never wasted 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 I remember last year that I had a royce 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.510
 at the beginning of the game and put him 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 extreme and it was God I put him from Seville 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
 the goodbye of put of half left and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 almost gave us notice he almost plays with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.210
 nothing good then with alexis sanchez this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.850
 it does not happen is incredible, well, you are going to see it 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 it really does not happen because I receive almost 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.489
 in the midfield with him and I 'm leaving 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 of all with alexis sanchez is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 incredibly incredibly good that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 uncle I thought it would be for so much 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.899
 but yes it is yes also something else 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.829
 to point out sincerely almost 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.900
 all is good news 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.970
 you have to villa another thing that had to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 comment is that villa is god or is this 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.740
 uncle I put him also as I say in the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.140
 video you see that this is a goal time and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.670
 the team explained it in another video 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.110
 in the video I said good so I'm going to put 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.729
 to villa because I'm excited 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.409
 play with villa because it has been of my 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.689
 front favorites here does not seem so 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.490
 bad I do not know what but thinking good will be 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.640
 good but still you do not go in a 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.140
 supercrack or be honestly and without 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.700
 cut my tongue or as you say without 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 hairs on the tongue I say that villa is 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.130
 the best forwards who try the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 game because it is that it has four 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.780
 stars and by the way after finishing like this 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.270
 Sanchez has four stars and is that 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.450
 it really is that he gets it absolutely 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.240
 everything or everything or everything is everything you go 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.179
 let's see later because this is the end of this 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 this this video and then what you have to 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.729
 do is another video explaining the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.200
 next template then in the next 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.369
 template will also put me to villa 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.159
 because it's really that I've fallen in love 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.049
 in this team and is that it is very cheap 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.920
 for what is good for what is me 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.990
 I mean 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.310
 You see how he dribbles good right now 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.450
 the good thing is not exactly the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 clips I do not know it by heart but 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 playing if they do not come out on this one in this 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.950
 video then simply playing with the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.780
 team 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.370
 in a single match, I got involved 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.769
 some goals from midfield that is that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.269
 they are not they are not real with villa then 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.010
 another thing that the Soriano wanted to point out 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.560
 that more surprised enough let's say for 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.060
 bad not bad for good sincerely in his 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.920
 game that is worth 30 thousand coins so 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.450
 for the 30 thousand coins that is worth is of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.239
 fucking mother things as we are already that 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.140
 it was clear before playing with him but 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.340
 I do not know what happens that in terms of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.989
 statistics I think it was exactly 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.630
 like villa I think they changed him 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.069
 a couple of pace that has less today 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.989
 a couple of passes that also have something 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.380
 so certainly the faults also to the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.360
 I saw all I do not know what's wrong with this 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.220
 sun and not that it shows quite the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.200
 difference between villa and he only has 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.840
 the difference to a star from 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.130
 filigree and bad leg also that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 villa with the bad leg has five and 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.970
 is that brands from anywhere but good 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.200
 what he said that it shows a lot and not 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.700
 I know why because in statistics 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.500
 I was fixing and in statistics in 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 game are very similar but it is a 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.579
 little bit more duck I'm just in the game 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.530
 and that comes a little more to add about 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.360
 the good players you already see the goal 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.099
 that just scored well this is not a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.060
 golazo am I am I commented on the 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.590
 March 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.299
 the goal that almost scored but good 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.829
 ends a goal also because of those 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.460
 shots to trisca I have marked them 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.590
 Playing 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.050
 of kill the first touch crossing the o 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.970
 is it great santi cazorla either 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.410
 I was disappointed very very very good at 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.700
 two goals scored by the way 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.900
 bit of luck and at the same time bad 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.240
 lucky to give the squad in a 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.740
 market that great goal but good and what 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.870
 I have the video, that's a little bit 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.200
 most outstanding of alexis sanchez and little 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.500
 plus 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.770
 what is good, what you already know when 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.420
 finish this video because you have in the 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.220
 vital description description 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.570
 next video upload I'll leave it in the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.520
 description of this video when uploading 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.040
 Well, the next episode I have left 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.410
 only two episodes in case of that 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.820
 that he goes up because good at casting 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.920
 to win because I already say so in 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.750
 second division ascended then in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.790
 first division if doing well already 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.650
 ends the time goal is a series that good 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.690
 already starts at fifa 16 and the people already be 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.060
 well before this series did not have much 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.860
 I support so much because I will have less I see it 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.090
 totally logical in those who say today 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.730
 what bitch I do not know that I see it totally 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.750
 logical and good what I said kids I think 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.340
 that there is nothing more to say 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.110
 You played a great goal for Chile in the World Cup 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.820
 with villa player himself and even the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.340
 next in an expected I leave here and what of 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.810
 always the pharmacies and such is so that the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.200
 social is a bit and until next time 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.200
 kids
