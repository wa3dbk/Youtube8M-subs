00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
I just going to give some little bit of

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.500 
I just going to give some little bit of
look<00:03:44.110> or<00:03:44.349> what<00:03:44.739> he<00:03:44.799> can<00:03:44.950> do<00:03:45.069> is<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.269> like

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
look or what he can do is this for like

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.809 
look or what he can do is this for like
red<00:03:46.750> blue<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.110> when<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.590> fold<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:48.040> part<00:03:48.489> I

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
red blue and when you fold this part I

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.610 
red blue and when you fold this part I
know<00:03:49.709> like<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.099> looks<00:03:51.760> like<00:03:51.909> a<00:03:52.620> different

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
know like this looks like a different

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.369 
know like this looks like a different
like<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:54.099> looks<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.610> reversible<00:03:55.299> but<00:03:56.200> it's

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
like it looks like a reversible but it's

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.670 
like it looks like a reversible but it's
not<00:03:56.680> actually<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:58.360> reason<00:03:58.870> why<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.019> did<00:03:59.319> only

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
not actually but reason why I did only

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.830 
not actually but reason why I did only
this<00:03:59.829> part<00:04:00.159> not<00:04:00.370> all<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.970> because<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:01.420> didn't

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
this part not all is because I didn't

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.160 
this part not all is because I didn't
really<00:04:01.930> had<00:04:02.200> enough<00:04:03.450> felt<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.659> do<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.140> I

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
really had enough felt to do it so I

just did a little bit part so as you can

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.080 
just did a little bit part so as you can
see<00:04:07.299> when<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.599> fold<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:09.720> super<00:04:10.720> thickness<00:04:12.090> you

filling thingy you can buy it any crap

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.540 
filling thingy you can buy it any crap
place<00:04:58.180> like<00:04:58.570> whatever<00:04:58.960> yeah<00:04:59.530> but<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.190> can<00:05:00.370> use

a<00:05:00.820> cotton<00:05:01.270> ball<00:05:01.620> negative<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.770> cotton<00:05:03.100> balls

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
a cotton ball negative the cotton balls

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.840 
a cotton ball negative the cotton balls
but<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.810> takes<00:05:05.110> like<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.680> lot<00:05:06.280> of<00:05:06.430> cotton<00:05:06.730> balls

but it takes like a lot of cotton balls
so<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.540> really<00:05:08.170> recommend<00:05:08.290> using<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.980> feeling
