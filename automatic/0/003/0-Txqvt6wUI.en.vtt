million<00:01:17.909> reasons<00:01:18.060> why<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.430> think

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
million reasons why that is but I think

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you see that's the problem I think one

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
you see that's the problem I think one
of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> reasons<00:01:40.890> things<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.610> slowing<00:01:41.939> down

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of the reasons things are slowing down

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
of the reasons things are slowing down
so<00:01:42.570> much<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.619> days<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.250> nobody

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so much these days is because nobody

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
so much these days is because nobody
talks<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.570> nobody's<00:01:46.409> allowed<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> say

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

talks about it nobody's allowed to say
anything<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
anything and I think I think that's I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.639 
anything and I think I think that's I
think<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> real<00:01:53.700> problem<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.810> we

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
think that's the real problem I think we

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
think that's the real problem I think we
need<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.950> talk<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.610> more

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

need to talk about these things more
often<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.590> we're<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> say<00:01:59.009> things<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
often and we're going to say things that

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.690 
often and we're going to say things that
are<00:02:00.200> inconsiderate<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> rude<00:02:02.149> but<00:02:04.520> they<00:02:05.520> need

maybe we need to do it for a while I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.830 
maybe we need to do it for a while I
don't<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.220> know<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> more

that<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.099> something<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.940> think

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
that this is something that I think

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.320 
that this is something that I think
about<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.390> lot<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:04.879> the<00:03:05.879> one<00:03:06.060> thing<00:03:06.090> i

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
about a lot and I think the one thing i

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.270 
about a lot and I think the one thing i
do<00:03:06.390> believe<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.290> believe<00:03:07.349> we<00:03:07.769> all<00:03:07.800> need<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
do believe is I believe we all need to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.979 
do believe is I believe we all need to
talk<00:03:08.580> about<00:03:08.879> it<00:03:09.000> more<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.360> think<00:03:09.659> we<00:03:09.750> need<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
talk about it more I think we need to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.640 
talk about it more I think we need to
talk<00:03:10.110> about<00:03:10.290> things<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:11.459> are<00:03:11.700> are

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
talk about things that that are are

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.309 
talk about things that that are are
off-limits<00:03:13.970> because<00:03:14.970> those<00:03:15.480> are<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.870> topics

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
off-limits because those are the topics

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.660 
off-limits because those are the topics
that<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.830> bring<00:03:16.980> us<00:03:17.129> back<00:03:17.430> together

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
that are going to bring us back together

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.759 
that are going to bring us back together
again<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.360> feel<00:03:18.659> that<00:03:18.690> communication<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
again I feel that communication is the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.500 
again I feel that communication is the
solution<00:03:20.220> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
solution to

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.750 
solution to
all<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.200> world's<00:03:22.470> problems<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.640> think

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
all of the world's problems and I think

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.509 
all of the world's problems and I think
that's<00:03:23.970> where<00:03:24.269> we<00:03:24.330> should<00:03:24.420> start<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:25.739> that's

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
that's where we should start but that's

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.909 
that's where we should start but that's
all<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.760> got
