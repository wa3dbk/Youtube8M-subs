00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello very good to everyone with this video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
 tutorial of fritz and with tutorials os 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 We will teach how to create a photo of 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.130
 profile so that it fits exactly in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.140
 ours in the box that we have in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.980
 our facebook profile in addition 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 we will take advantage as we are creating a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 tournament the league of legends in our 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.130
 university to teach you how to create a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.770
 type of letters that are very that will be very 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 similar to that of the ship three originals 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.280
 of the ico fly ends 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 first of all we will have to adapt the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.600
 this photo to the size that we 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.190
 we want to do what we will do 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.420
 will unlock the layer 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 and we will go 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.539
 camps phase 6 and here 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.339
 we will put pixels and choose a 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.850
 size as you see we have 3,000 by 1200 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:06.869
 we will get it from 2,600 to 2,600 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 in this way and from the center and from 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.080
 This way what we will do is that the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.080
 picture is square 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.990
 what they see is that it has gotten bigger 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.240
 by the upper and lower ends 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.590
 now we will fill in the parts are 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.990
 empty upper lower 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.830
 I fill it with black because I like it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.460
 plus 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.820
 ok this will be our profile picture and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.980
 to the size is the one that is already therefore 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.290
 what we will do is make the letters 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.290
 to make the letters we will use 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.750
 a typeface that is called freeze 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.320
 block is gone 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.510
 is the letter of the state lic of legends se 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.520
 You can easily download to the internet and 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.670
 to install it you can watch a tutorial 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.530
 we've posted recently on 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.850
 how to install sources in our 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.780
 computer 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.080
 we create the letter 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.289
 This is the name of our association 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.869
 which is what organizes the whole tournament 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:14.420
 league of legends and now let's talk 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.530
 Swipe options to customize it 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.550
 but first of all we'll go here 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.140
 we will put in the babel smooth these hundred 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.890
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.950
 here we will put 21 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.190
 it's worth it we leave it like that it 's fine here 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.270
 we will change and we will put this one here 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.270
 to get it to have this effect of 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.270
 volume 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.690
 and we will put here the colors I have made 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.690
 by tests before and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.260
 and obtained this good color these 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.260
 colors 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.060
 I have been testing and with the tool 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.230
 to catch the color of any photo 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.230
 is here 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.780
 with this one here I've been testing the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 different colors that come these 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.930
 letters and I've taken out these ones that I think are 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.350
 they seem pretty 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.210
 OK 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.500
 this we leave the same 'screening' 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.630
 multiplayer now we go to the contour 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.940
 and we leave it as is with the bar 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:29.230
 History in diagonal and the range 50% 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:34.080
 now we will go to what is the stroke 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.080
 but the stroke we will put 21% 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.630
 of a 91 pixels we will put it 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.260
 centered 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.569
 we will double it is well normal 100% and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:56.299
 here the color 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.299
 we will put 30 to 0 to 32 and 33 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.320
 and finally we will go to the gradient that 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.320
 is this one here 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.470
 of gradient we do not have the this is 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.940
 well normal 100% here I have created a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.299
 gradient that is this 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.320
 this is what I have done that I think 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.660
 be one of my tests the most similar 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.140
 I've been testing for example in this 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.140
 color here 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.919
 has this code that can do it 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.630
 do you with patience to go 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.530
 trying the different colors to see 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.530
 which one looks more 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.420
 I have not been entirely accurate because 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.160
 there are colors that are more for example in 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.280
 the base of the air that the color is more 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.740
 dark I do not stay the same but with 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.639
 a little patience you can nail 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.379
 the color 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.249
 I leave you this what I have done I believe 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:03.509
 which looks pretty therefore 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:07.169
 ok we're ok now we see 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.059
 another other text in this part above what 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.769
 I will put smaller because if not I will not 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:16.880
 we will see first first the 

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:19.480
 uppercase is tournament 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.480
 but 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.630
 the first tournament 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.430
 that is to say 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.430
 a space to answer here 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.680
 Now we have to do the same as 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.120
 we have done with the one below but as 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.650
 we already have the template made which is 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.009
 we have this much easier if 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.800
 we put secondary button and what 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:52.409
 we will do is a copy lifestyle we will copy 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:56.889
 the kind of effects and we go here to the 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:00.950
 text station and we paste it and we 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.800
 it remains as just as the one below 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.650
 and now what we will do is always the 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.960
 tiny and doing tests I had left 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.590
 wrong the space between letters 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.750
 if I do not have it here, it's worth 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.510
 and we will do the same as we paste 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.150
 very well and this is how that is how we 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.050
 it remains perfectly unwanted 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.110
 but I think it pretty much looks like 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.330
 now we save the file 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.699
 figures 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.699
 and we save it as jpg 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.900
 we will do it here 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.720
 a profile 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.330
 and save 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.529
 with maximum quality and the other we leave it 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.289
 as is 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.969
 and this now we just need to upload it to 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.639
 Facebook 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.830
 where would it be like this 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.289
 although it is cut they put numbers 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.840
 larger in the image 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.340
 change the size and return it again 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.430
 to fill in the blank space that 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.729
 would be with black paint in this case 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:14.060
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:16.430
 tutorial do not forget to put it like 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.499
 subscribe to the channel and if someone is 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.659
 animates and has a team of 5 and plays lol 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:21.909
 and wants to sign up for the tournament 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:25.900
 welcome be 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:25.900
 thank you very much and until another
