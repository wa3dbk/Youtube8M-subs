00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
is the hopper basically what this thing

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.549 
is the hopper basically what this thing
does<00:00:38.109> is<00:00:38.620> when<00:00:38.920> like<00:00:39.609> anything<00:00:40.089> falls<00:00:40.449> onto<00:00:41.440> it

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
does is when like anything falls onto it

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.549 
does is when like anything falls onto it
it<00:00:41.800> will<00:00:42.069> basically<00:00:42.309> like<00:00:43.059> go<00:00:43.359> into<00:00:43.929> it<00:00:44.050> it's

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
it will basically like go into it it's

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.469 
it will basically like go into it it's
an<00:00:44.649> awesome<00:00:44.800> thing<00:00:45.219> for<00:00:45.819> creating<00:00:46.299> like

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
an awesome thing for creating like

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.229 
an awesome thing for creating like
chicken<00:00:47.289> egg<00:00:47.440> farms<00:00:47.829> or<00:00:48.159> something<00:00:48.609> else<00:00:48.819> the

chicken egg farms or something else the
next<00:00:49.539> thing<00:00:49.659> is<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:49.989> dropper<00:00:50.440> basically

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
next thing is the dropper basically

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.069 
next thing is the dropper basically
anything<00:00:51.429> you<00:00:51.699> put<00:00:51.879> in<00:00:51.940> here<00:00:52.059> on<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.929> know

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
anything you put in here on you know

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.309 
anything you put in here on you know
like<00:00:53.350> armor<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:54.039> when<00:00:54.699> it's<00:00:55.690> activated<00:00:56.109> it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
like armor and when it's activated it

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.590 
like armor and when it's activated it
will<00:00:56.350> basically<00:00:56.649> put<00:00:57.069> the<00:00:57.219> armor<00:00:57.519> on<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:57.879> next

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
will basically put the armor on you next

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.539 
will basically put the armor on you next
the<00:00:58.959> next<00:00:59.079> thing<00:00:59.379> is<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.709> activator<00:01:00.339> rail

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
the next thing is the activator rail

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.649 
the next thing is the activator rail
basically<00:01:01.420> just<00:01:01.659> think<00:01:02.109> I<00:01:02.969> activates<00:01:03.969> let's

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
basically just think I activates let's

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.280 
basically just think I activates let's
say<00:01:05.610> hmm<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.810> know<00:01:07.930> when<00:01:08.140> it's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
say hmm like you know when it's

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.340 
say hmm like you know when it's
activated<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.980> when<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.280> like<00:01:09.880> for<00:01:10.150> example

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
activated and when you like for example

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400 
activated and when you like for example
with<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.400> card<00:01:12.600> card<00:01:13.600> with<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.840> rip<00:01:14.080> would<00:01:14.230> be

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
with a card card with a rip would be

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:22.270 
with a card card with a rip would be
with<00:01:15.010> TNT<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.060> basically<00:01:16.420> blow<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.780> hell<00:01:17.080> up

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.920 

so<00:01:23.280> that's<00:01:23.520> awesome<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.270> daylight

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so that's awesome this is daylight

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.720 
so that's awesome this is daylight
sensor<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.590> basically<00:01:25.950> activates<00:01:26.430> with

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
sensor this basically activates with

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.330 
sensor this basically activates with
redsnow<00:01:27.300> round<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.870> when<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.560> daytime<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.190> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
redsnow round it when it's daytime and I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
redsnow round it when it's daytime and I
will<00:01:29.460> show<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.760> simple<00:01:30.240> thing<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:31.110> next

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
will show you a simple thing the next

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
will show you a simple thing the next
video<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.010> probably<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.430> annotated

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
video which will probably be annotated

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.930 
video which will probably be annotated
in<00:01:33.300> this<00:01:33.570> video<00:01:33.870> how<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.220> create

in this video how you can like create

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.420 
in this video how you can like create
whenever<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> comes<00:01:36.780> night<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.650> become<00:01:37.950> day<00:01:38.160> so

it's not something that I did the added
day<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> did<00:01:41.850> daylight<00:01:42.570> sensor<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.170> love<00:01:43.410> it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
day I did daylight sensor I will love it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.000 
day I did daylight sensor I will love it
next<00:01:44.340> thing<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.270> trap<00:01:46.110> chest<00:01:46.530> basically

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
next thing is the trap chest basically

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.280 
next thing is the trap chest basically
what<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.310> does<00:01:47.550> is<00:01:47.760> when<00:01:48.390> opened<00:01:48.900> it<00:01:49.110> will

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
what this does is when opened it will

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.900 
what this does is when opened it will
basically<00:01:49.530> active<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.160> rest<00:01:50.400> on<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.760> not<00:01:50.850> sure

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
basically active at rest on I'm not sure

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.250 
basically active at rest on I'm not sure
if<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.300> see<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.800> activated<00:01:53.760> or<00:01:54.000> not

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
if you can see if it's activated or not

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.500 
if you can see if it's activated or not
but<00:01:55.260> yeah<00:01:56.100> basically<00:01:56.400> activates<00:01:57.030> restaurants

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
but yeah basically activates restaurants

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.990

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you can like in multiplayer create traps

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
you can like in multiplayer create traps
when<00:02:00.270> somebody<00:02:00.630> opens<00:02:00.690> your<00:02:01.170> chest<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:02.040> next
