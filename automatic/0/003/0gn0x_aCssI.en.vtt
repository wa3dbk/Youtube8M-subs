but like I said we're beginners right
network<00:01:13.840> we're<00:01:14.470> working<00:01:14.649> with<00:01:14.950> beginners<00:01:15.310> and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
network we're working with beginners and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.730 
network we're working with beginners and
we<00:01:16.119> just<00:01:16.330> want<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.600> get<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.810> basic<00:01:17.200> form<00:01:17.530> and

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
we just want to get the basic form and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.950 
we just want to get the basic form and
shape<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.310> now<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:21.220> doing<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> eyes<00:01:22.210> all

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
shape of it now when doing the eyes all

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.850 
shape of it now when doing the eyes all
I'm<00:01:23.320> going<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.619> do<00:01:23.740> in<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.979> eyes<00:01:24.160> is<00:01:25.710> come<00:01:26.710> to

this area right here I'm just going to

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.340 
this area right here I'm just going to
kind<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.310> draw<00:01:30.550> up<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.180> down<00:01:31.780> like<00:01:32.020> little

kind of draw up and down like little

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.859 
kind of draw up and down like little
triangles<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:32.979> other<00:01:33.100> words<00:01:33.369> move<00:01:34.270> triangles

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
my knife and then we'll cut along little

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.050 
my knife and then we'll cut along little
triangles<00:01:47.459> and<00:01:48.459> I'm<00:01:48.550> going<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.819> move<00:01:49.030> that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
triangles and I'm going to move that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.360 
triangles and I'm going to move that
would<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:49.660> that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.250 

say

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.230 

cut<00:02:00.740> down<00:02:01.900> cut<00:02:02.900> better

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.630 

and<00:02:08.780> slowly<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.650> just<00:02:09.980> kind<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.220> remove<00:02:10.490> that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
and slowly this just kind of remove that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.860 
and slowly this just kind of remove that
would<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.090> there<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.210> lot<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.450> times<00:02:14.720> you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
would in there now a lot of times you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.030 
would in there now a lot of times you
can<00:02:15.020> take<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.230> little<00:02:17.110> there<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.200> go<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.770> like

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
can take a little there we go so like

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:33.650 
can take a little there we go so like
that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.830 

hey<00:02:34.740> Soto<00:02:36.180> he<00:02:37.180> takes<00:02:37.450> place<00:02:37.780> on

we've had a lot of fun doing this and I
know<00:06:41.759> if<00:06:42.000> I<00:06:42.150> said<00:06:42.360> I'm<00:06:42.779> lot<00:06:43.020> faster<00:06:43.650> I

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
know if I said I'm lot faster I

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.490 
know if I said I'm lot faster I
go<00:06:44.639> faster<00:06:45.060> so<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.240> don't<00:06:45.449> spend<00:06:45.690> too<00:06:46.080> much<00:06:46.229> to

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
have to do too many parts but I think we

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.950 
have to do too many parts but I think we
got<00:06:49.319> a<00:06:49.470> 10<00:06:49.860> parts<00:06:50.190> this<00:06:50.280> time<00:06:50.340> but<00:06:51.300> anyway<00:06:51.599> this

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
got a 10 parts this time but anyway this

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.559 
got a 10 parts this time but anyway this
is<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.139> doll<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:52.830> this<00:06:53.610> is<00:06:53.729> our<00:06:53.849> project<00:06:54.389> and

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.569
