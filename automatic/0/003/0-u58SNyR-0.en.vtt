we want them out in the wild I guess you

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.780 
doing for the US Army and from there we
derive<00:02:30.510> how<00:02:30.750> something<00:02:31.709> actually<00:02:31.860> works<00:02:32.130> and

derive how something actually works and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.199 
derive how something actually works and
then<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.480> extract<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.489> simplify<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
then we extract that and simplify it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.740 
then we extract that and simplify it
into<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.980> now<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:39.209> meet<00:02:39.420> with

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
constraints can sometimes be a good

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.490 
constraints can sometimes be a good
thing<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.400> having<00:02:57.239> those<00:02:57.480> type<00:02:58.350> of

thing so having those type of
constraints<00:02:59.130> actually<00:02:59.310> helps<00:03:00.090> us<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.620> extract
