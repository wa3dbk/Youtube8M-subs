00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
look at that blade it's quite Cheney and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.039 
look at that blade it's quite Cheney and
mere<00:01:59.779> polish<00:02:00.139> but<00:02:00.319> you've<00:02:00.499> got<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.709> really

mere polish but you've got a really
pretty<00:02:03.049> look<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.709> blade<00:02:03.920> you've<00:02:04.130> got<00:02:04.310> a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
pretty look to the blade you've got a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.899 
pretty look to the blade you've got a
very<00:02:04.869> like<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:05.959> said<00:02:06.139> a<00:02:06.170> deep<00:02:06.829> edging<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.549> the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
very like I said a deep edging on the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.150 
very like I said a deep edging on the
layers<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:09.110> cladding<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.709> can<00:02:09.890> feel

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
layers on the cladding and you can feel

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.530 
layers on the cladding and you can feel
it<00:02:10.310> when<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.550> run<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:10.850> fingers<00:02:11.150> over<00:02:11.330> there

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
that's a traditional Japanese install

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.850 
that's a traditional Japanese install
that<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.730> not<00:02:43.880> something<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.630> my<00:02:45.260> opinion<00:02:45.680> that

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
that is not something in my opinion that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.930 
that is not something in my opinion that
should<00:02:46.130> be<00:02:46.280> messed<00:02:46.520> with

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
should be messed with

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.400 
should be messed with
it's<00:02:47.060> they<00:02:47.300> do<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:48.020> tap<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
it's they do that so you can tap the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.290 
it's they do that so you can tap the
handle<00:02:48.740> on<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.610> becomes<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.000> little<00:02:50.120> bit

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
handle on if it becomes a little bit

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.270 
handle on if it becomes a little bit
loose<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.840> traditional<00:02:51.830> look<00:02:52.010> which<00:02:52.160> i

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
loose it's a traditional look which i

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.220 
loose it's a traditional look which i
think<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.610> nice<00:02:52.790> plus<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.660> get<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> little<00:02:54.140> bit

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
think is nice plus you get a little bit

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.560 
think is nice plus you get a little bit
extra<00:02:54.440> space<00:02:54.770> there<00:02:54.800> for<00:02:55.250> your<00:02:55.370> finger<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.360> fit

take a look at the profile and I'll

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.870 
take a look at the profile and I'll
bring<00:03:13.430> our<00:03:13.580> cutting<00:03:13.880> board<00:03:14.060> in<00:03:14.240> here<00:03:18.880> so

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
bring our cutting board in here so

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.210 
bring our cutting board in here so
here's<00:03:20.180> our<00:03:20.330> edge<00:03:20.510> profile<00:03:21.470> on<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.860> kit<00:03:22.100> it's

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
here's our edge profile on this kit it's

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.620 
here's our edge profile on this kit it's
okay<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.800> see<00:03:25.070> it's<00:03:25.489> fairly<00:03:26.330> flat

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
okay and you can see it's fairly flat

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.540 
okay and you can see it's fairly flat
overall<00:03:27.140> with<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.530> touch<00:03:27.770> of<00:03:27.800> belly<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.430> it

overall with just a touch of belly to it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.800 
overall with just a touch of belly to it
let's<00:03:29.480> put<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.050> board<00:03:34.330> so<00:03:35.330> it's<00:03:35.600> got<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
let's put it on the board so it's got a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.580 
let's put it on the board so it's got a
smooth<00:03:36.260> roll<00:03:36.560> into<00:03:37.130> kind<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.120> gentle<00:03:39.110> stop

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
smooth roll into kind of a gentle stop

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.949 
smooth roll into kind of a gentle stop
at<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.920> heel<00:03:40.190> there's<00:03:40.580> not<00:03:40.730> really<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.300> true

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
at the heel there's not really a true

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.260 
at the heel there's not really a true
back<00:03:42.290> belly<00:03:42.560> per<00:03:43.340> se<00:03:43.580> on<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.970> just<00:03:44.000> kind

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
back belly per se on this it just kind

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.940 
back belly per se on this it just kind
of<00:03:44.300> rolls<00:03:44.510> into<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.780> very<00:03:44.959> gentle<00:03:45.350> stop<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.860> the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
of rolls into a very gentle stop on the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.090 
of rolls into a very gentle stop on the
heel<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.810> you've<00:03:47.930> got<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.140> kind<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.010> a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
the front you can rock this up in here

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.360 
the front you can rock this up in here
before<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.810> start<00:04:00.080> digging<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.410> tip<00:04:00.680> in<00:04:03.370> it

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
before I start digging the tip in it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.130 
before I start digging the tip in it
just<00:04:04.550> it's<00:04:04.820> really<00:04:05.120> part<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:05.630> what<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.870> pay<00:04:06.019> on
