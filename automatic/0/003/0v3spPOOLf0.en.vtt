what would you what's the most important

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440 
what would you what's the most important
bit<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> casting<00:00:47.340> kit<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.059> spend<00:00:48.300> your

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
bit of the casting kit to spend your

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.979 
bit of the casting kit to spend your
money<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:49.640> rod<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.820> reckon<00:00:51.120> yeah<00:00:51.449> definitely

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
money on rod so reckon yeah definitely

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
money on rod so reckon yeah definitely
yeah<00:00:52.199> only<00:00:52.890> thing<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.160> dollar<00:00:53.370> rods<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
yeah only thing with dollar rods and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
yeah only thing with dollar rods and
I've<00:00:54.149> used<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.539> well<00:00:55.170> forever<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.430> use

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I've used them well forever was use

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
I've used them well forever was use
dollar<00:00:56.850> kit<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.690> from<00:00:58.350> when<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.590> had<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
dollar kit but from when we had the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
dollar kit but from when we had the
amorphous<00:00:59.010> rods<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> 90s<00:01:00.510> yeah<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
amorphous rods back in the 90s yeah you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
amorphous rods back in the 90s yeah you
know<00:01:01.140> they're<00:01:01.739> returning<00:01:02.160> point<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
know they're returning point because of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.729 
know they're returning point because of
the<00:01:02.730> lack<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> torque<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> blank<00:01:04.170> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the lack of torque in the blank so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.850 
the lack of torque in the blank so
accuracy<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.400> casting<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.119> easy<00:01:06.860> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
accuracy of casting was very easy and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
accuracy of casting was very easy and
distance<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.990> made<00:01:10.140> everything<00:01:10.409> much

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
distance was just made everything much

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.179 
distance was just made everything much
easier<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.130> cast<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.580> long<00:01:11.700> range<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> way

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
easier to cast a long range and the way

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.679 
easier to cast a long range and the way
things<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.270> mean<00:01:15.540> they're

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
things are going now I mean they're

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.490 
things are going now I mean they're
managing<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:16.619> into<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.610> longbow<00:01:18.380> which<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
managing to put into a longbow which is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
managing to put into a longbow which is
a<00:01:19.530> fraction<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> price<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.369> an<00:01:20.670> infinite

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
a fraction of the price of an infinite

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.640 
a fraction of the price of an infinite
either<00:01:21.240> managing<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> put<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> same<00:01:22.290> sort<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
either managing to put the same sort of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
either managing to put the same sort of
stuff<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.820> would<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.000> seen<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.299> an

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
stuff that you would have seen in an

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
stuff that you would have seen in an
amorphous<00:01:24.659> ten<00:01:25.049> years<00:01:25.229> ago<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.009> better

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
amorphous ten years ago if not better

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.819 
amorphous ten years ago if not better
yeah<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> mean<00:01:26.939> they're<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.210> similar<00:01:27.509> rods

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
yeah I mean they're very similar rods

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
yeah I mean they're very similar rods
really<00:01:28.829> similar<00:01:29.009> no<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.670> bows<00:01:30.030> twelve<00:01:30.689> foot

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
really similar no some bows twelve foot

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.800 
really similar no some bows twelve foot
three<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.200> three-quarter<00:01:31.880> rods<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.600> came

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
three and three-quarter rods that came

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
three and three-quarter rods that came
from<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> day<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.500> spent<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.070> nori<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
from that day we spent out with nori the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.179 
from that day we spent out with nori the
rod<00:01:35.670> builder<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.299> rod<00:01:36.450> designer<00:01:36.890> they're<00:01:37.890> um

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
rod builder or rod designer they're um

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
rod builder or rod designer they're um
they're<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.060> close<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.509> an<00:01:39.570> infinitely<00:01:40.020> narrow

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
they're so close to an infinitely narrow

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
they're so close to an infinitely narrow
those<00:01:40.380> long<00:01:40.590> bows<00:01:41.509> definitely<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> rods<00:01:42.750> more

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
those long bows definitely the rods more

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
those long bows definitely the rods more
important<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.340> reels

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
important but you know there are reels

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
important but you know there are reels
at<00:01:44.670> every<00:01:44.850> budget<00:01:45.149> point<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.840> yeah

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
at every budget point now on there yeah

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.010 
at every budget point now on there yeah

and I and everything you know then
they're<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.909> fractional<00:01:56.909> we're<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.450> pi<00:01:57.630> years

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
they're a fractional we're two pi years

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.469 
they're a fractional we're two pi years
ago<00:01:58.140> when<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.500> bought<00:01:58.680> SS<00:01:59.610> three<00:01:59.820> thousands

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
