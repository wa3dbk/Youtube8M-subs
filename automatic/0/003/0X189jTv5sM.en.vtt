00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.130
 very good to everyone and see if guys and 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.809
 welcome to a Dominican run game 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.960
 be here we are a game called controls 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.279
 of wii if one I discovered all the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.810
 issue of the controls and the truth that has 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.359
 a lot of mini-games in fact there is a 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.529
 magnet makeup monkey rope twist 2 that 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.720
 surely I will record directly 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.949
 after this because I want to leave 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.149
 tested while I'm traveling and 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.460
 the truth is that it's cool a lot so without 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.199
 more there are these options like a thousand ways 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.480
 and in fact we have like a two three 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.430
 four five six seven eight in fact 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.380
 there are some who even split me saying 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.060
 I would not have recorded this game because 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.800
 it sounds a lot to me since there are usually some 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.560
 similar so we will choose without further 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.210
 a first option is a bazooka or 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.620
 facts like that kills everything looks and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.620
 PampÃ¡n painting 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.480
 but 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 but 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.180
 a good bomb the thing is that it goes like 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.330
 bursting people and then what you have to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330
 do 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 how are we with the water 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.899
 with the fact of being alive 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 like the chainsaw we're going to do 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.990
 another of these games are short because 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.509
 do not have much in fact they would be from the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 first that would come out of the big 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.470
 like when it's been quite a lot 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 because it's like mans tics 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.100
 Look, look how you order it to go to a 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.890
 plant the last of the glasses or 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.260
 poor thing, it's a pity he is all the time 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.030
 fighting and the ending and kill him 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.320
 same so without further we are going to choose the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.700
 next action that is the one that 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.930
 you can put the comments 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.380
 which one is your favorite already tried me 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.830
 I was left with the katana because that tale of 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.830
 matrix 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.840
 he just literally rips his mouth 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.310
 always comes from the glasses at the time 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.890
 timely I do not know what's coming of the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.940
 boxes let's do another test wheels 77 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.940
 with the m-40 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.530
 and here you have a golf ball to the eye 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.530
 in the mouth 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:32.819
 this is a nail nail gun 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.909
 with a finish like a kind of harpoon 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.909
 by god we go with you guys jack f 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:51.489
 it is better to leave this evil and if we go 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.489
 with the power of place 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 ok I just won with this this portal 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.270
 that is the power of the mind the following 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.820
 to all of the pp denied something says that times 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.820
 with this I split it in half ethical 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.930
 so good without more guys I hope that 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.100
 you liked the game is short 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.990

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.880

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.770
 directly to record the magners of 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.510

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.040
