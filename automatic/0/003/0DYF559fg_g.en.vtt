00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.120
 Hello friends 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.380
 I 'm going to show you this reel, which is the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 reel that I am using 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.970
 and it is the occupation at 65 that is to say it is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.610
 a reel that does not weigh too much since 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.360
 oscillates between 500 foundations 30 or so 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.570
 extra if I'm not wrong then also 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:36.970
 has the crank is folding here what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:41.050
 we see is in 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.990
 at a level the earth is very good for the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 theme of keeping it in our backpacks 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.520
 of fishing or macutos what we use 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.970
 us to transport our 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.970
 reels 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:00.890
 the ratio of collection is 3.8 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.630
 point 1 that means that it collects 86 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.970
 centimeters per turn for my taste 80 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.690
 and 100 centimeters per turn is what 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.060
 I want because if it bites a bream that 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.230
 is what we want a golden 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.200
 sport as there is no prefer to enjoy it 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.110
 much more time like a reel than 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.780
 do not pick up too much and be able to enjoy 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.180
 that piece then this reel that's why 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.210
 I have three is not that I have some that 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.910
 I have three you collect 86 centimeters 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.500
 turn another interesting thing about this 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.720
 reel 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.860
 is that I take a little brush to both 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.840
 sides for 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.740
 I do not know if it will be to clean it 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.020
 it is so that it rubs less but the truth 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.649
 that looks pretty good 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.350
 and its use is for that if it is for 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.740
 something not here do not get components by 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.050
 put components here we see it say yes 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.880
 you will see how some brushes 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.690
 the two parties 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.270
 and then it's also a reel that has 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.080
 an enclosure one of them 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.080
 anti-corruption 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 then also here we have more 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.590
 reel characteristics 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.350
 like all the reels it also carries 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.980
 a Teflon coil for large 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.950
 distances 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.470
 This is a coil forged in steel 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.170
 in the box that you will see there in the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.060
 camera but it says that conical bovine of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.140
 cold forged aluminum 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.270
 plus the Teflon supplementary coil 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.270
 and then the cup that we have commented 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.990
 It is anti tangle of lines 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.580
 good as all the races I 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.130
 part that I stay positive of this 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.950
 reel is that which collects what has 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.900
 I collect by return for my taste 86 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.330
 centimeters per lap is what I 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.880
 I want 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.220
 it's not a reel that weighs too much 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.500
 aesthetically it is a nice reel 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.970
 throws pretty well since the coil 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.830
 knows the thread pretty well for a 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.950
 coil the brake is a powerful brake already 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.780
 we 've checked it because we got stung 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.780
 a streak of carriage 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.680
 and we can verify it and nothing I 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.390
 I have already bought a season 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.690
 three more of the same ratio 86 centimeters 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.430
 per return that is the ratio this 38.1 does not 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.519
 I know if you'll see it there 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.270
 good to tell you that it is about the price 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.880
 is about 110 107 100 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.780
 in stores and the internet I will not say 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.780
 no why 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.520
 but nothing that in any store yes that 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.250
 many times we can find it in 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.450
 liquidation because 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.570
 and that's a spool that is not known 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.720
 but that for me has earned my 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:22.490
 acceptance and concello because as 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.810
 we are always comparing shimano daiwa 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.050
 we are buying high reels 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.510
 quality at very high prices and here 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.880
 We are buying this reel with a 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.910
 pretty good price we have already 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.850
 commented 110 euros and it's a reel 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.850
 good is a reel and I am active today 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.570
 today if you offer me is another reel or not what 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.970
 change me if someone can serve you 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.360
 he had taught he has taught him reel 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.780
 to compare prices or even 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.260
 buy this I'm glad then here 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.290
 we have put retractable here the 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.720
 pastillita a reel pin for 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.780
 that when we put it in 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.950
 in the street of the reel holder no no 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.990
 rub and do not peel and that I do not have a 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.230
 season and here you see that no 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.600
 it 's not at all worn out and 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.360
 then you will see 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.270
 it is a very very soft reel that 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.160
 pick up very very very soft and here we see it 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.380
 since the coil is down until 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.390
 It goes back down again there are 4 cranks here 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.870
 we see it as a 2 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.330
 and four on four levels that goes up very 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.590
 fast either that is a movement already 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.320
 as we have commented 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.620
 if you have served someone with aid 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.630
 reel and the explanation is valid and if 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.180
 you have some doubt because it is a question 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.890
 on that reel other reels that 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.890
 I also had an opportunity to try 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.800
 come a greeting and I hope that I have 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.800
 served something
