00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
that's a bit of a stretch

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.960 
that's a bit of a stretch
but<00:05:00.290> not<00:05:00.590> as<00:05:00.800> bad<00:05:01.040> as<00:05:01.220> Robin<00:05:01.550> Hood<00:05:01.580> just

that<00:05:04.430> episode<00:05:04.880> was<00:05:05.090> bad<00:05:05.950> times<00:05:06.950> quad<00:05:07.250> was<00:05:07.460> one

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
that episode was bad times quad was one

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.430 
that episode was bad times quad was one
of<00:05:07.790> those<00:05:07.910> ideas<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.450> worked<00:05:08.630> on<00:05:08.780> paper<00:05:09.110> and

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
of those ideas that worked on paper and

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.070 
of those ideas that worked on paper and
for<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.010> while<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.550> worked<00:05:10.790> on<00:05:10.910> screen<00:05:11.270> but

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
for a while it worked on screen but

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.640 
for a while it worked on screen but
after<00:05:12.530> some<00:05:12.740> time<00:05:12.770> lost<00:05:13.640> its<00:05:13.940> luster<00:05:14.650> two

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
after some time lost its luster two

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.710 
after some time lost its luster two
seasons<00:05:16.160> they<00:05:16.550> hit<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:16.910> major<00:05:17.060> historical

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
seasons they hit the major historical

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.990 
seasons they hit the major historical
figures<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.740> my<00:05:18.890> guess<00:05:19.160> is<00:05:19.370> they<00:05:19.580> ran<00:05:19.790> out<00:05:19.970> of

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
figures so my guess is they ran out of

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.810 
figures so my guess is they ran out of
ideas<00:05:20.200> you<00:05:21.200> know<00:05:21.320> what<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.770> think<00:05:22.310> that's<00:05:22.670> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
ideas you know what I think that's the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.500 
ideas you know what I think that's the
way<00:05:22.940> it<00:05:23.090> should<00:05:23.120> be<00:05:23.330> time<00:05:24.170> moves<00:05:24.410> on<00:05:25.330> next<00:05:26.330> time

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
way it should be time moves on next time

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.180 
way it should be time moves on next time
we<00:05:26.720> have<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.870> three<00:05:27.170> for<00:05:27.410> one<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.950> grim

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
we have a three for one the grim

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.270 
we have a three for one the grim
