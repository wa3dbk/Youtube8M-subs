like<00:02:57.239> about<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.480> sometimes<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.080> feels<00:02:58.230> a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
like about it sometimes it feels a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.949

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the first two times I used it my hair

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
the first two times I used it my hair
wasn't<00:03:05.970> really<00:03:06.239> soft<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.080> I'm<00:03:07.350> guessing<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
wasn't really soft so I'm guessing a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.240 
wasn't really soft so I'm guessing a
dusky<00:03:08.130> type<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.489> protein<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.570> my<00:03:09.750> hair<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:11.130> it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
dusky type of protein to my hair and it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.890 
dusky type of protein to my hair and it
does<00:03:11.400> send<00:03:11.610> weak<00:03:11.880> protein<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.660> after

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
does send weak protein in it but after

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.360 
does send weak protein in it but after
the<00:03:12.959> third<00:03:12.989> fourth<00:03:13.530> day<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.709> seems<00:03:13.950> my<00:03:14.130> hair

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the third fourth day it seems my hair

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.880 
the third fourth day it seems my hair
felt<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:14.910> bit<00:03:15.150> softer<00:03:16.110> which<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.590> really

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
felt a little bit softer which I really
