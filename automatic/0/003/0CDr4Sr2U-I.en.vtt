you guys welcome back in this tutorial
I'm<00:00:02.820> gonna<00:00:02.939> show<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.240> how<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.540> use<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> visual

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I'm gonna show you how to use a visual

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.179 
I'm gonna show you how to use a visual
clip<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.279> visual<00:00:05.700> clip<00:00:05.970> advanced<00:00:06.710> he's<00:00:07.710> uh

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
clip in visual clip advanced he's uh

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.250 
clip in visual clip advanced he's uh
these<00:00:08.340> are<00:00:08.490> really<00:00:08.730> fun<00:00:08.849> tools<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.870> like<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
these are really fun tools but like the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
these are really fun tools but like the
name<00:00:10.469> implies<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:11.280> only<00:00:11.429> cuts<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.150> see

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
name implies it only cuts what you see

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.070 
name implies it only cuts what you see
it<00:00:12.929> doesn't<00:00:13.290> actually<00:00:13.530> cut<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.400> model<00:00:14.960> in<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
it doesn't actually cut the model in the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.630 
it doesn't actually cut the model in the
future<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.560> might<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.920> tools<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.279> actually

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
future we might have tools that actually

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.730 
future we might have tools that actually
cut<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> model<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.510> although<00:00:18.810> coders<00:00:19.710> in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
cut the model but although coders in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.769 
cut the model but although coders in
this<00:00:19.949> game<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:21.000> play<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.750> game

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
this game don't actually play the game

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769 
this game don't actually play the game
so<00:00:22.710> they<00:00:23.039> don't<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.430> what<00:00:23.460> needs<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.449> done

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
so they don't know what needs to be done

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
so they don't know what needs to be done
and<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.590> done<00:00:26.689> but<00:00:27.689> uh<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:29.039> useful

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and not done but uh it is a very useful

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.930 
and not done but uh it is a very useful
tool<00:00:30.260> like<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.669> bit

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
tool like you can see here like this bit

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
tool like you can see here like this bit
sticks<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.079> maybe<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.590> get

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sticks out you know maybe I want to get

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
sticks out you know maybe I want to get
rid<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> hover

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
rid of that and you can see when I hover

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
rid of that and you can see when I hover
over<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> two<00:00:38.550> colors<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.660> green

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
over it's got the two colors the green

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
over it's got the two colors the green
is<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.530> will<00:00:40.680> stay<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.700> red<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> what

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
is what will stay and the red is what

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.860 
is what will stay and the red is what
will<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> cut<00:00:42.809> off<00:00:44.360> some<00:00:45.360> things<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
will be cut off some things about the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.529 
will be cut off some things about the
tool<00:00:46.399> there's<00:00:47.399> visual<00:00:47.610> clip<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
tool there's visual clip and the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.639 
tool there's visual clip and the
advanced<00:00:48.840> tool<00:00:50.780> myself<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.960> don't<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.320> use

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
advanced tool myself I don't really use

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.670 
advanced tool myself I don't really use
the<00:00:52.949> visual<00:00:53.280> cliff<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> only<00:00:53.850> use<00:00:54.059> advanced<00:00:54.680> but

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the visual cliff I only use advanced but

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
the visual cliff I only use advanced but
uh<00:00:55.710> there's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> number<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.820> settings<00:00:57.180> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
uh there's a number of settings your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590 
uh there's a number of settings your
distance<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> most<00:00:59.219> important<00:00:59.760> your

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
distance one is the most important your

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.149 
distance one is the most important your
pitch<00:01:00.960> that's<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> pitch<00:01:01.969> obviously

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
pitch that's the pitch obviously

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.289 
pitch that's the pitch obviously
something<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
something like that right now the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.230 
something like that right now the
regular<00:01:06.630> visual<00:01:06.900> clip<00:01:07.229> tool<00:01:07.820> decimals<00:01:08.820> don't

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
regular visual clip tool decimals don't

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.469 
regular visual clip tool decimals don't
work<00:01:09.450> that's<00:01:09.840> why<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
work that's why I don't really use it

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.070 
work that's why I don't really use it
but<00:01:12.479> um<00:01:13.400> yeah<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:14.880> reset<00:01:15.360> which

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but um yeah there's also reset which

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.530 
but um yeah there's also reset which
just<00:01:16.320> resets<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.130> develop<00:01:17.490> values<00:01:17.880> render

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
just resets to develop values render

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.749 
just resets to develop values render
inside<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.960> prop<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:20.310> useful

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
inside of prop that's really useful

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
inside of prop that's really useful
especially<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.509> props<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:22.770> right

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
especially for props like this one right

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.640 
especially for props like this one right
here<00:01:23.159> where<00:01:24.060> he<00:01:24.210> doesn't<00:01:24.810> render<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.229> part<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
here where he doesn't render a part of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.359 
here where he doesn't render a part of
it<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:28.140> move<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> distance<00:01:28.740> away<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.100> it's

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it just move the distance away so it's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.170 
it just move the distance away so it's
like<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.759> green<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
like all green and take that and all of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.620 
like all green and take that and all of
a<00:01:33.240> sudden<00:01:33.479> has<00:01:33.570> got<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:33.869> inside<00:01:34.460> amazing

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
a sudden has got an inside amazing

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.760 
a sudden has got an inside amazing
normally<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> want<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> leave<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
normally you want to leave that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490 
normally you want to leave that
unchecked<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:39.780> things<00:01:39.960> lag<00:01:40.259> here

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
unchecked you can make things lag here

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
unchecked you can make things lag here
some<00:01:41.009> reasons<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.790> why<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
some reasons I don't know why but a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.039 
some reasons I don't know why but a
visual<00:01:46.110> clip<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:47.340> pretty<00:01:48.270> easy<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
visual clip it's pretty easy to use and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
visual clip it's pretty easy to use and
me<00:01:49.110> reset<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.530> Here<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.329> am

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
me reset this Here I am

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
visual clip you left-click to complete

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.249 
visual clip you left-click to complete
the<00:01:55.020> action<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> other<00:01:58.049> two

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
yeah so let's move on to this little bit

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.510 
yeah so let's move on to this little bit
here<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.110> want<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.290> get<00:02:08.380> rid<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.680> that<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.399> I

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
here we want to get rid of that like I

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.270 
here we want to get rid of that like I
said<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.759> don't<00:02:09.940> really<00:02:10.660> use<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:12.040> regular

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
said I don't really use the regular

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.120 
said I don't really use the regular
visual<00:02:12.880> clip<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.600> annoying<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.290> only<00:02:14.920> use

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
visual clip it's annoying I only use

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.910 
visual clip it's annoying I only use
advanced<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:16.300> uh<00:02:16.330> if<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.810> click<00:02:17.140> visual

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
advanced but uh if you click visual

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.300 
advanced but uh if you click visual
click<00:02:18.130> advanced<00:02:18.520> there<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:20.560> forgot<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.190> mention

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
click advanced there I forgot to mention

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.990 
click advanced there I forgot to mention
max<00:02:21.760> clips<00:02:22.180> per<00:02:22.420> pop<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.710> only<00:02:23.950> six<00:02:24.730> I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
max clips per pop and is only six I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.660 
max clips per pop and is only six I
think<00:02:25.270> by<00:02:25.720> default<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.560> three<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.400> just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
think by default it's at three so just

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.380 
think by default it's at three so just
set<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.150> six<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.930> means<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.890> can't<00:02:30.390> clip

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
set it to six this means you can't clip

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.450 
set it to six this means you can't clip
it<00:02:31.510> prop<00:02:31.750> more<00:02:32.020> than<00:02:32.170> six<00:02:32.440> times<00:02:32.530> which<00:02:33.190> you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
it prop more than six times which you

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.900 
it prop more than six times which you
shouldn't<00:02:33.760> ever<00:02:33.880> really<00:02:34.330> need<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.840> anyways

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
shouldn't ever really need to anyways

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.930 
shouldn't ever really need to anyways
don't<00:02:36.910> overuse<00:02:37.660> clip<00:02:37.990> because<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.430> drag

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
don't overuse clip because it will drag

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.920 
don't overuse clip because it will drag
your<00:02:40.090> framerate<00:02:40.390> down<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> little<00:02:41.020> bit<00:02:41.790> but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
your framerate down a little bit but

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.550 
your framerate down a little bit but
let's<00:02:43.930> get<00:02:44.050> back<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.410> clipping<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.130> off<00:02:45.340> here

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
let's get back to clipping this off here

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.110 
let's get back to clipping this off here
make<00:02:47.560> sure<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.770> got<00:02:47.890> advanced<00:02:48.520> visual<00:02:48.880> clip

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
make sure you got advanced visual clip

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.140 
make sure you got advanced visual clip
selected<00:02:49.810> here<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.400> we're<00:02:51.760> gonna<00:02:51.880> set

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
selected here and then we're gonna set

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.560 
selected here and then we're gonna set
the<00:02:52.300> plane<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.200> plane<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:54.570> invisible

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the plane the plane is the invisible

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.680 
the plane the plane is the invisible
wall<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.680> tell<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.340> where<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.610> start<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.360> cut<00:02:58.570> it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
wall to tell it where to start to cut it

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.110 
wall to tell it where to start to cut it
and<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.800> you're<00:03:00.400> gonna<00:03:00.520> hold<00:03:00.730> your<00:03:00.910> Shift

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and then you're gonna hold your Shift

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.160 
and then you're gonna hold your Shift
key<00:03:01.450> make<00:03:02.260> sure<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.470> do<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.840> left<00:03:04.840> click

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
the side of this washing machine and now

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.810 
the side of this washing machine and now
when<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.910> look<00:03:10.120> at<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.900> sink<00:03:11.500> here<00:03:11.820> it's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
when you look at the sink here it's

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.270 
when you look at the sink here it's
gonna<00:03:13.060> clip<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:14.560> little<00:03:14.950> bit<00:03:15.100> right<00:03:15.220> there

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
gonna clip that little bit right there

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.040

and adjust it for some reason for the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.479 
and adjust it for some reason for the
advanced<00:03:22.180> tool<00:03:22.510> decimals<00:03:23.350> work<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.830> don't<00:03:24.220> know

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
advanced tool decimals work I don't know

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.190 
advanced tool decimals work I don't know
why<00:03:26.610> but<00:03:27.610> uh<00:03:27.670> now<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:27.970> all<00:03:28.239> nice<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.690> clean

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
this prop usually what I'll do is uh on

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.770 
this prop usually what I'll do is uh on
something<00:04:06.310> flat

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
something flat

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.490 
something flat
I'll<00:04:08.080> use<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.590> as<00:04:08.800> a<00:04:09.130> plane<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.080> today<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.350> want

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
I'll use it as a plane so today I want

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.710 
I'll use it as a plane so today I want
to<00:04:11.590> cut<00:04:11.740> part<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.220> fridge<00:04:12.640> I'll<00:04:13.330> use<00:04:13.570> this

to cut part of that fridge I'll use this
as<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.050> plane<00:04:14.380> here<00:04:14.890> move<00:04:15.820> that<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.630> then

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
as the plane here move that in and then

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.160 
as the plane here move that in and then
I'll<00:04:17.799> shift<00:04:18.459> click<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.720> then<00:04:19.900> right-click
