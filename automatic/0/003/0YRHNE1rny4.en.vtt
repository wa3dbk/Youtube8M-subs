100 times 8 which is 800 hit first scan

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.310 
100 times 8 which is 800 hit first scan
it<00:01:17.780> scans<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.770> out<00:01:20.079> go<00:01:21.079> back<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.470> your<00:01:21.560> game

eight and then you check out the values
ok<00:02:07.479> I've<00:02:07.570> got<00:02:07.630> 121<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.670> want<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.970> withdraw

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
ok I've got 121 so I want to withdraw

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.910 
ok I've got 121 so I want to withdraw
121<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:13.030> I'm<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.780> calculate<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.560> so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
121 now I'm going to calculate this so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.430 
121 now I'm going to calculate this so
this<00:02:15.670> might<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.420> second<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:18.250> 21<00:02:19.170> times<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
this might be a second one 21 times a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.730 
this might be a second one 21 times a
equals<00:02:21.090> 9<00:02:22.090> 68

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
equals 9 68

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.050 
equals 9 68
okay<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.540> we've<00:02:25.750> seen<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:27.880> needed

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
okay now that we've seen that we needed

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.310 
okay now that we've seen that we needed
more<00:02:28.390> money<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.870> type<00:02:29.740> in<00:02:29.890> 968<00:02:30.790> not<00:02:31.690> new<00:02:31.990> scan

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
more money we type in 968 not new scan

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.350 
more money we type in 968 not new scan
next<00:02:32.830> scan<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.810> should<00:02:35.110> be<00:02:35.140> your<00:02:35.350> value

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360
