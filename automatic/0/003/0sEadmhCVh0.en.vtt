00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
they're very slow they're very careful

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
they're very slow they're very careful
and<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.710> by<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.400> leading

and they just go one by one and leading

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
and they just go one by one and leading
edge<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.360> take<00:01:33.570> their<00:01:33.780> time<00:01:33.810> they

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
edge and they take their time they

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.340 
edge and they take their time they
always<00:01:34.470> use<00:01:34.619> magnification<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.049> this<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.229> not

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
always use magnification and this is not

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069 
always use magnification and this is not
about<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> done<00:01:38.130> fast<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> irony<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
about get it done fast but the irony of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
about get it done fast but the irony of
that<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.430> slow<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that is that because they go slow and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
that is that because they go slow and
