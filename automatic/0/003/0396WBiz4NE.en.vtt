to<00:01:36.240> move<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.659> ball<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.320> direction

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to move this ball in the right direction

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.020 
to move this ball in the right direction
we<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.369> make<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.670> even<00:01:38.850> more

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we think we can make it even more

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
we think we can make it even more
progresso<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.530> present<00:01:41.070> isn't<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
progresso the present isn't going the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.080 
progresso the present isn't going the
lead<00:01:42.030> we're<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.820> stop

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
lead we're going to and we will stop

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.010 
lead we're going to and we will stop
inversions<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.890> fix<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.340> broken<00:01:47.520> code

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
inversions when we fix this broken code

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
inversions when we fix this broken code
congressman<00:01:49.020> what's<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.680> hard<00:01:49.950> about<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
congressman what's so hard about this I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
congressman what's so hard about this I
mean<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.030> used<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.689> back<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.259> day<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
mean it used to be back in the day in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.789 
mean it used to be back in the day in
Congress<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.430> compromised

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
Congress there was compromised

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.959 
Congress there was compromised
Republicans<00:01:55.799> wanted<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.250> thing<00:01:56.430> Democrats

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
Republicans wanted one thing Democrats

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
Republicans wanted one thing Democrats
wanted<00:01:57.270> another<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.079> middle<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.409> think

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
wanted another in the middle I think

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
wanted another in the middle I think
there<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:58.799> enough<00:01:58.920> people<00:01:59.100> who<00:01:59.579> probably

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
there are enough people who probably

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.569 
there are enough people who probably
agree<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.619> corporate<00:02:01.920> taxes<00:02:02.250> could<00:02:02.369> come

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
agree the the corporate taxes could come

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.310 
agree the the corporate taxes could come
down<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.240> some<00:02:03.450> loopholes<00:02:03.810> could<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.079> closed

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
down that some loopholes could be closed

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.749 
down that some loopholes could be closed
that<00:02:04.469> something<00:02:04.920> could<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.250> done<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that something could get done but it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.460 
that something could get done but it
seems

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
seems

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.499 
seems
like<00:02:06.590> folks<00:02:07.460> in<00:02:07.610> Congress<00:02:07.760> get<00:02:08.119> rewarded<00:02:08.479> for

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
like folks in Congress get rewarded for

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.359 
like folks in Congress get rewarded for
talking<00:02:09.080> about<00:02:09.170> stuff<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.830> their<00:02:09.950> positions

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
talking about stuff in their positions

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.070 
talking about stuff in their positions
more<00:02:10.759> than<00:02:10.910> actually<00:02:11.300> getting<00:02:11.330> stuff<00:02:11.870> done

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
more than actually getting stuff done

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.830 
more than actually getting stuff done
what's<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.710> hard<00:02:12.950> about<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.180> know<00:02:14.300> the

what's so hard about this you know the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.040 
what's so hard about this you know the
president<00:02:15.470> leading<00:02:16.460> on<00:02:16.670> key<00:02:17.090> issues<00:02:17.120> would<00:02:17.900> be

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
president leading on key issues would be

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.620 
president leading on key issues would be
immensely<00:02:18.560> helpful<00:02:19.000> that's<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.210> it's<00:02:20.390> got

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
immensely helpful that's how it's got

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.540 
immensely helpful that's how it's got

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
many data points at this point to look

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.110 
many data points at this point to look
at<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.680> mean<00:03:00.860> what<00:03:01.190> what<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.520> leadership<00:03:01.670> look

at I mean what what is leadership look

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.020 
at I mean what what is leadership look
like<00:03:02.300> yeah<00:03:03.020> it<00:03:03.709> isn't<00:03:04.130> an<00:03:04.220> executive<00:03:04.790> order

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
like yeah it isn't an executive order

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.880 
like yeah it isn't an executive order
and<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.600> certainly<00:03:05.810> isn't<00:03:06.170> this<00:03:06.470> inversion

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
and it certainly isn't this inversion

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.490 
and it certainly isn't this inversion
bill<00:03:07.370> which<00:03:07.700> ignores<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.870> root<00:03:09.110> cause<00:03:09.470> of

these companies uncompetitive pneus and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.930 
these companies uncompetitive pneus and
it<00:03:12.170> actually<00:03:12.200> makes<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.920> problem<00:03:13.220> worse<00:03:13.400> my

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
it actually makes the problem worse my

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.600 
it actually makes the problem worse my
prediction<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:15.200> president's<00:03:15.739> will<00:03:15.980> hold

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
prediction is the president's will hold

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.759 
prediction is the president's will hold
on<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:17.060> my<00:03:17.480> my<00:03:18.080> prediction<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
on if my my prediction of the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.680 
on if my my prediction of the
president's<00:03:19.160> bill<00:03:19.340> were<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.760> pass<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.450> would

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690

told our network this morning he said

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.750 
told our network this morning he said
that<00:03:36.200> basically<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.220> American<00:03:37.489> public

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
that basically the American public

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.070 
that basically the American public
shouldn't<00:03:38.090> back<00:03:38.239> companies<00:03:38.690> doing<00:03:38.870> this

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
shouldn't back companies doing this

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.509 
shouldn't back companies doing this
because<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.380> effectively<00:03:39.769> going<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.160> end<00:03:40.310> up

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.539

it's<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.709> be<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> shareholders<00:03:46.519> of

create jobs here in America they're

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.460 
create jobs here in America they're
finding<00:03:58.970> they<00:03:59.209> can't<00:03:59.480> compete<00:03:59.720> around<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
finding they can't compete around the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.560 
finding they can't compete around the
world<00:04:00.680> with<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.340> broken<00:04:01.820> tax<00:04:02.060> code<00:04:02.360> they're

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
world with this broken tax code they're

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.449 
world with this broken tax code they're
doing<00:04:02.930> what<00:04:03.380> they<00:04:03.530> need<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.769> do<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.040> try<00:04:04.430> to

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
grow themselves as a company I think the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.270 
grow themselves as a company I think the
best<00:04:07.120> tax<00:04:08.120> relief<00:04:08.510> is<00:04:08.720> not<00:04:08.930> only<00:04:09.230> fixing<00:04:10.160> this

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
best tax relief is not only fixing this

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.370 
best tax relief is not only fixing this
broken<00:04:10.340> code<00:04:10.970> but<00:04:11.239> doing<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:11.750> way<00:04:11.900> for

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
broken code but doing in a way for

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.800 
broken code but doing in a way for
companies<00:04:12.650> who<00:04:12.920> succeed<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:14.180> invest<00:04:14.599> their

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
companies who succeed can invest their

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.779 
companies who succeed can invest their
profits<00:04:15.319> here<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.650> United<00:04:16.039> States<00:04:16.310> they

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
profits here in the United States they

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.120 
profits here in the United States they
can't<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.390> today<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.560> think<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.979> root

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
can't do that today so I think the root

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.569 
can't do that today so I think the root
cause

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
cause

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.429
