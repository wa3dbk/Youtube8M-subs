 just or just world records and yes 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.000
 let's start 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 there is a woman in this world who has 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 his name just fucking 80 centimeters 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.810
 to let grow 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.480
 yes she was born in 1979 and is up to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
 and with 2009 she has her name slut too 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.179
 to grow 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 because there was a she 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.660
 probably it would just be even longer 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 will grow but it is coming 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.989
 because she has a car accident there 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.500
 and then her nails are too 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 broken 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.360
