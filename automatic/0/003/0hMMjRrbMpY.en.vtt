00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.700
 welcome an addition to full boris of his 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.139
 preferred channel your trusted channel of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.080
 destruction of arms we bring you the 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.940
 best routine to define and give 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.580
 volume to all your arms both in the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.230
 biceps like in the triceps you will be routine 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.109
 and even playback series always 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.939
 will be to attract thiago and yuyo that are 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.739
 the people who have the arms more 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.679
 big and most defined of all of us 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.329
 the first exercise in our first 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.519
 chapter here we see thiago is going to be 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.469
 Olympic tricep we have activated 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.629
 doing it with a lot of weight 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.780
 doing it with 90 pounds on each side and 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.030
 that we are going to do 6 to 10 repetitions 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.320
 let's work everything that is power 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.629
 let's work all that is strength 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.609
 in this exercise as well as what are 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.440
 watching the whole exercise in the video 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.109
 must reach to the chest and stretch 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.649
 completely to give you all the work 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.320
 To the sad that they need they already know from 6 to 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.030
 10 repetitions if you can only 5 then 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.840
 leave it in five but I handle a weight 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.019
 pretty strong that allows them 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.380
 grow that muscle the second exercise 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.880
 it's press french muscle pÃ©rez french in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.940
 a flat bench as you are seeing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.530
 here with a dumbbell this dumbbell does not 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.600
 it must be so heavy but neither so 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.820
 light should be a dumbbell that 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.580
 allows you to do 10 repetitions with each 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.140
 arm just like the first exercise this 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.810
 we will repeat it four 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.000
 times 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.890
 if you see how it contracts all the tri you see 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 This is an excellent exercise. 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 be very careful with the technique 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.009
 you should always do between the dumbbell and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.280
 the shoulder an angle approximately 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.079
 90 of 90 degrees and they should extend 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.750
 until the end as if they were giving 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.270
 a kick like the sad exercise 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.450
 fundamental for all the part of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.520
 sad obviously this one received you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.090
 already knows extensions of triceps 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.060
 how it makes up high with rope is a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.200
 excellent exercise that always 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.140
 we apply our training tris 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.240
 and well they are going to do here also from 6 to 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.270
 10 repetitions with the maximum weight that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.340
 you can 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.780
 after we 're going to go I warned only 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.640
 We are going to work three exercises 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.260
 triceps and three biceps exercises in 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.360
 our first in our first 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.500
 chapter of this series the first 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.750
 exercise is going to be 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.849
 kurt device with dumbbells is very 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.580
 important that they do it with their maximum 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.560
 weight can swing a little bit but 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.360
 they happen to have the back straight the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.569
 chest outside is only allowed to swing 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
 a little bit basically to get the weight out 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.959
 we want we want there 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.060
 very much blood flow both in the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.970
 biceps like the triceps that's why we're going to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.849
 use quite a bit of weight in fact we're going to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.760
 use our maximum weight let's 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.290
 Do also 6 to 10 repetitions 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.230
 also at the end of this exercise we are going 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.680
 to take the 45 pound bar as it does not 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.690
 it weighs a lot and we're going to work the most 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.800
 of repetitions that we can do to 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.190
 work a definition 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.290
 [Music] 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.120
 this we are going to do in the last round 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.100
 they saw in the fourth round is that we're going to 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.990
 give weight we will do bike courses 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.790
 We can do it with dumbbells 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.250
 separated or we can also do it 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.570
 same time and now it's going to look 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.250
 rain in the video that will do it at 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.580
 same time and you see the difference 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.800
 and can adopt any of the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.210
 ways of doing it can be done separately 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.710
 how is thiago doing or what can 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.710
 do at once as it does 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.580
 remember that we are going to work with 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.290
 our maximum weight 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.720
 sometimes it is very difficult sometimes we 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.280
 we balanced a little more we help each other with 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.530
 the back but all this is allowed 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.530
 only if you work with your maximum weight 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.400
 we have to accustom the muscle 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.290
 always more always more here we go to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 do bikes really concentrated here 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.069
 the technique is very easy to do 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.189
 just let the dumbbell come down 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.510
 maximum that we can find the floor 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.340
 we use the other arm to maintain 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.319
 balance and we always press the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.760
 plane always on the whole site has to 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.700
 being contracted abdomen has arms 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.799
 from thiago the truth is that he has a good 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.470
 volume and a good and excellent 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.480
 definition and that's why they are 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.819
 those chosen to show us all the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.379
 routines that says and sad because they are 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.449

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.859
 that for culture I can bring you all 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.600

 now let's look at the way that 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.560
 you can do these last two 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.259
 exercises the exercise of cool with 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.699
 Dumbbells can do so 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 raising one arm first and then 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.120
 of the other or they can do it as it is 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.940
 doing here what they both do to the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.830
 time that is to say or do this exercise or 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.960
 you do the other one although I'm going to show you 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.090
 Bizet five years must be

 conscious and they have to know that they are 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.320
 nothing else three we are going to choose it 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.390
 here is contracting everything that is 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.000
 everything the bicep part looks at 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.960
 judo how it will read part of the chest well 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.970
 trained has also improved a lot and 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.060
 as we say we have 194 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.430

 that is, they can do the first three 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.510
 exercises that you saw or can combine
