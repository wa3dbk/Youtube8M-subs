getting free packs over and over again
so<00:01:10.799> you'll<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.189> well<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.729> pack

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so you'll see as well I don't pack

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.630 
so you'll see as well I don't pack
anything<00:01:12.390> amazing<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.260> obviously

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
anything amazing because obviously

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.950 
anything amazing because obviously
unfortunately<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.030> only<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.509> standard

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
unfortunately it was only the standard

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960 
unfortunately it was only the standard
free<00:01:16.140> packs<00:01:16.409> which<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> basically<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.670> rare

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
free packs which is basically one rare

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
free packs which is basically one rare
and<00:01:18.210> 12<00:01:18.869> items<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.470> also<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.340> very

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and 12 items over also it was very

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.070 
and 12 items over also it was very
unlikely<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.330> me<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> either<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.960> an

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
unlikely for me to either get an

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.749 
unlikely for me to either get an
informal<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> high<00:01:23.009> worth<00:01:23.250> player<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
informal just the high worth player and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
informal just the high worth player and
of<00:01:24.180> course<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> silver<00:01:24.990> player<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.350> well

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
of course it's a silver player as well

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
of course it's a silver player as well
so<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.979> even<00:01:26.460> less<00:01:26.729> chance<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> getting<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so it's even less chance of getting a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
so it's even less chance of getting a
player<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.350> worth<00:01:28.560> value<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.280> sometimes

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
player which is worth value so sometimes

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
player which is worth value so sometimes
I<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> keep<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.439> gold<00:01:31.710> packs

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
