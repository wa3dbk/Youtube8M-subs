00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.169
 to be sure that the balloon bursts 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.330
 place to crash 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:20.410
 you have to start by taking the good 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.750
 balloon to here is a water balloon it is 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.470
 made of poor quality latex and it 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 is extremely fine this last point is 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.250
 Very important 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.680
 here is a stuff decor balloon 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 it's the same thing but in latex two 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.149
 times thicker and so much more 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.120
 resistant one if you take this balloon 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.460
 in very fine latex you have a bomb to 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.379
 high potential it will just take you 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.840
 ensure maximum impact and 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.510
 to make it explode in explanation 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.780
 images plus something is launched loudly 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.070
 plus this thing to gain speed and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.399
 the more gear shifting will be 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.230
 abrupt when it will hit its target 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.109
 wholesale more on years strong the bomb 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.369
 the more we are lucky to see it explode 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.979
 and the stronger the target is 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.130
 better because the impact will be more 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.130
 strong 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.530
 do not use decoration balloons 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.119
 choose a solid target is launched 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:26.110
 strong that at the price well a single criterion 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.149
 misses and that's the cat the balloon is in 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.240
 Too thick the gag turns to the session of 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.240
 torture 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 good go we start again talent is soft 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.030
 it does not work better 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.210
 mathieu do not know at all what 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.770
 wait for it it's merry jokers look 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.190
 to know what they are doing it is targeting the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.619
 hard surface of his back the height 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.080
 ensures good acceleration 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.670
 beaulieu burst the balloon has transferred 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.229
 his momentum to the little boy 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 who received the equivalent of a bullets 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.049
 weight of 4 kg ny throw at 30 km time 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.770
 here is a young man who wants to make a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.770
 joke to his friend's father 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 he had the good idea to use a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.980
 condom as water bombs in 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.020
 forgetting that they are just not 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.210
 designed to burst 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.140
 irony of history this gentleman risk 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.550
 good never to have children again 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.160
 having learned from his mistakes the joker 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.710
 change of containers abbas is a lot 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.850
 better 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.010
 these budding scientists are well 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.870
 equipped and 7 catapult value ensure 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.950
 a nice impetus 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.760
 hope, however, that they have 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.760
 learned a water balloon 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.100
 we must believe that we 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.570
 it hurts yes
