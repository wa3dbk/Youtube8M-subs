00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
like this three different phases for

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.340 
like this three different phases for
when<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> place<00:00:34.920> objects<00:00:35.570> normal<00:00:36.570> fixed<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
like so they can just stand up straight

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.750 
like so they can just stand up straight
or<00:00:42.690> whatever<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> put

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it on fixed you can pick it up for the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.630
