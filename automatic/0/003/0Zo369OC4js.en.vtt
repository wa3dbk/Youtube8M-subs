00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 you 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.480
 yes 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.220
 in the bible there is a verse that is 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.160
 in genesis chapter 2 verse 18 that 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.850
 in the traditional versions says no 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.040
 It is good that the man that man is 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.000
 single 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.540
 I will make him suitable help for him however 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 when you see the original and you examine 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.120
 with care there is a different idea 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.760
 in the text should not surprise us 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 because all versions of the bible 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 in a language that is not the original in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 what was written are interpretations 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.690
 so it should not be surprising that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.030
 suddenly we see difference that says the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.540
 original the original says is not good 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.210
 that handam this adam word show 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.650
 the expression adam has been delegated that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.530
 of expression that generally we 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 we think depending on the first that being 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.960
 created however the expression 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.479
 adam woch ha ha also in Hebrew is not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 a name is simply a noun 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.790
 generic refers to a genre if 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.300
 you read genesis chapter 5 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.110
 verse 2 there says the scripture that 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.270
 God named male and female to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.329
 both as 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 the expression jatamí literally comes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.759
 left sea ​​that is earth dust and from there 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.500
 an expression has been derived that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.990
 we use in Spanish which is the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.810
 human word that also comes from a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.700
 ground bus that has the same sense 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.579
 therefore the original text is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.030
 saying it's not good that the human being 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.399
 male and female are alone is not good at 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.599
 the god design the loneliness nor for the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.400
 male for the woman therefore 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.459
 drawing from that from that verse 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.680
 the idea we can say that the first 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.959
 purpose he gave was when he created the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.769
 male is the woman was that the male and 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.799
 the woman were fellow friends one 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.099
 on the other what is the first duty of the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.350
 wives to the spouses being friends of 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.970
 the sexes 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.510
 what is the first duty of the spouses 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.420
 towards wives being friends with their 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.580
 wives unfortunately for a matter 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.370
 Cultural sometimes women are more 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 friends of their children from their friends who from 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.460
 their husbands and their husbands are more 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.340
 Friends of their friends that of their wives 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.220
 and that is causing a misunderstanding and 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.890
 makes couples who live in it 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.630
 house sleep in the same bed but 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.360
 Finally, do not be friends, do not be 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.420
 companions couple's relationship 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.550
 sustains friendship friendship is what 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.310
 that allows couples to be solid 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.560
 and that they can finally in the long term 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.860
 maintain a link that helps them 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 grow and stay as a couple is not 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.620
 good that the human being is only the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.320
 loneliness destroys loneliness makes bitter 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.800
 the existence and there is no loneliness anymore 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.230
 difficult to cope with the loneliness of 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.180
 the company seems paradoxical but there 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.340
 many people who are in a couple or are 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.180
 married and feel alone 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.519
 because at some point usually in 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.950
 the first years of marriage or before 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.230
 of getting married they built a friendship 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.739
 solid but as it was happening the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.840
 time they got tangled they got complicated and that 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.629
 friendship that should have helped them 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.810
 keep your links finally went 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.879
 turning off as we do to maintain the 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.080
 friendship we have to understand that the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.170
 human beings we are changing 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.290
 constantly therefore we need 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.319
 keep renewed to believe 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.470
 in friendship and build friendship 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.109
 we have to give us time how long 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.940
 city ​​couples to be together without 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.930
 have sex just 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.789
 to be together in the week very little 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.949
 there are studies that show that some 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.280
 couples not conversed more than 5 minutes a 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.080
 the week and sometimes they argue or fight and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.240
 that is your moment of dialogue which is 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.180
 very exhausting that the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 couples to build friendship show 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.030
 friends commit to having time 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.100
 together at least one activity to the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.060
 week that occupies three or four hours 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.650
 What does it mean to play? 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.919
 perform some activity together without 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.919
 children without friends without other people who 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.169
 just build friendship because it is 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.139
 so important because friendship is going to 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.270
 make the couple can overcome the 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.669
 difficulties that are going to come because they 're going 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.990
 to have a link that will be able to 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.009
 help to stay stable 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 especially at critical moments 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:19.349
 that will undoubtedly come is not good that the 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.349
 be human 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.669
 Y 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.940
 and 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.860
