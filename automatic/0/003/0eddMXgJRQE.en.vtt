00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
older ones anymore because they don't

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.610 
older ones anymore because they don't
have<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.320> DNA<00:04:59.650> codes<00:05:00.090> because<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.570> like<00:05:02.229> having

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620

my<00:05:03.510> ones<00:05:04.510> with<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.750> DNA<00:05:04.990> codes<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.590> can<00:05:05.860> put

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
my ones with the DNA codes I can put

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.490 
my ones with the DNA codes I can put
them<00:05:06.160> on<00:05:06.280> lawn<00:05:06.520> because<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:07.180> really<00:05:08.020> don't<00:05:08.260> do
