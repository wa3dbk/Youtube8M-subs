as well really complicates things worst
case<00:01:04.619> scenario<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.729> an

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
case scenario you can actually get an

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
case scenario you can actually get an
abscess<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.510> horrible<00:01:07.260> bacteria<00:01:07.409> gets

abscess because horrible bacteria gets
in<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.220> rotting<00:01:08.610> away<00:01:08.700> phase<00:01:09.119> which

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
in this that's rotting away phase which

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
in this that's rotting away phase which
is<00:01:09.390> awful<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> main<00:01:10.619> reason<00:01:10.950> people<00:01:10.979> get

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
is awful so the main reason people get

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
is awful so the main reason people get
them<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.479> remove<00:01:12.990> hair<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
them is because they remove hair and

like<00:01:31.619> twice<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.250> three<00:01:32.490> times<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.790> week

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like twice or three times a week

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
like twice or three times a week
depending<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.360> his<00:01:33.450> skin<00:01:33.600> type<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.799> will

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
depending on his skin type that will

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.219 
depending on his skin type that will
remove<00:01:35.250> any<00:01:35.490> excess<00:01:35.880> skin<00:01:36.060> yes<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.930> skin

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
remove any excess skin yes your skin

remove any excess skin yes your skin
naturally<00:01:38.040> turns<00:01:38.310> over<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.030> naturally

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
naturally turns over and all naturally

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179

solve<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> dead<00:01:40.470> skin<00:01:40.680> cells<00:01:40.920> will<00:01:41.009> drop

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
solve you know dead skin cells will drop

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
solve you know dead skin cells will drop
off<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> new<00:01:41.970> skin<00:01:42.270> replaces<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> however<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
off and new skin replaces it however the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.469 
off and new skin replaces it however the
dead<00:01:44.009> skin<00:01:44.220> doesn't<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.640> drop<00:01:44.850> off<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> some

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
dead skin doesn't all drop off and some

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.639 
dead skin doesn't all drop off and some
of<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.780> cling<00:01:45.930> onto<00:01:46.079> your<00:01:46.229> face<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
of it will cling onto your face and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
of it will cling onto your face and
it'll<00:01:46.829> block<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.250> pores<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.700> block<00:01:47.909> your

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it'll block your pores or block your

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
it'll block your pores or block your
hair<00:01:48.149> follicles<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.110> sometimes<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> hair

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
hair follicles so then sometimes a hair

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380 
hair follicles so then sometimes a hair
can't<00:01:50.040> grow<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.820> has<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> find<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
can't grow out and it has to find like a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.850 
can't grow out and it has to find like a
different<00:01:51.720> route<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> sort<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> grow<00:01:52.740> around

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
different route and sort of grow around

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.859 
different route and sort of grow around
it<00:01:53.340> also<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> show<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.479> make<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.810> you

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
growing that way so that's the way my

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.080 
growing that way so that's the way my
hair<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.110> drumming<00:02:32.410> when<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.069> shave<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.880> shout

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
hair is drumming when I shave if I shout

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240

that<00:02:34.270> way<00:02:34.510> cut<00:02:35.170> through<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.470> if<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.040> shake

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
that way cut through it if I shake

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.400 
that way cut through it if I shake
backwards<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:36.970> or<00:02:37.120> tug<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.720> hair<00:02:37.930> follicle

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
backwards it's or tug the hair follicle

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.680 
backwards it's or tug the hair follicle
that<00:02:38.590> way<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> next<00:02:39.850> time<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.300> grows<00:02:40.480> its

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that way so the next time it grows its

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.270 
that way so the next time it grows its
or<00:02:40.840> does<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.440> curls<00:02:41.680> back<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.040> itself

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
or does that and curls back on itself

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.190 
or does that and curls back on itself

for a shave you use the right products
now<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.920> main<00:02:48.130> active<00:02:48.489> ingredient<00:02:48.610> most<00:02:49.180> of

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
now the main active ingredient most of

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.850 
now the main active ingredient most of
these<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.510> something<00:02:49.750> called<00:02:49.840> salicylic<00:02:50.470> acid

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
these is something called salicylic acid

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.460 
these is something called salicylic acid
but<00:02:51.340> basically<00:02:51.670> salicylic<00:02:52.209> acid<00:02:52.600> reduces

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
but basically salicylic acid reduces

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.740 
but basically salicylic acid reduces
inflammation<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.580> can<00:02:54.730> imagine<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.420> you
