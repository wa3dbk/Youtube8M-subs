bag<00:04:45.290> just<00:04:46.100> like<00:04:46.220> this<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.820> find<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.510> that's<00:04:47.990> a

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
bag just like this I find that that's a

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.740 
bag just like this I find that that's a
string<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.800> arm<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:50.120> i<00:04:50.150> don't<00:04:50.510> really<00:04:50.630> like

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
string on the arm so i don't really like

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.800 
string on the arm so i don't really like
carrying<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.560> bag<00:04:51.800> that<00:04:51.830> way<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:53.150> bag<00:04:53.390> has<00:04:53.630> the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
carrying a bag that way this bag has the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.740 
carrying a bag that way this bag has the
option<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.170> actually<00:04:54.770> carry<00:04:55.480> just<00:04:56.480> like<00:04:56.720> a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
option to actually carry just like a

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.720 
option to actually carry just like a
backpack<00:04:57.050> like<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.340> i<00:05:00.130> find<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.310> lot<00:05:01.550> more

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730
