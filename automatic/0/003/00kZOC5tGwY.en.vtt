00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.950
 Ajax did start a coffee cup with the match on a half field against Celtic 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.949
 ajax that in turn belongs to the favorites 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.799
 in this line fire cup 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.199
 double winner 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.589
 of course ajax but you have the first chance of the match 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.999
 for celtic that is the concern 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.999
 only for stand of leaves but he fetches 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.099
 and rather rude 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.829
 beautiful purple that fell away from the brook of the moore beaker 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.260
 one more time from the stream and donk 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.610
 from brabant with cake 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.700
 abdelhak nouri 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 and by that of the stream 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.070
 the two attacking midfielders 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.410
 and here another Celtic player escapes the offside trap 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 the ball is shot too wildly 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.280
 now the knife is bird 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 with the chance 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.270
 he again 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.560
 they don't have it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.060
 heitinga 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.250
 even though careful work would first exist even though it is morley again 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.440
 abdelhak nouri 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.090
 has nice movements caps the man to check out again and that with 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 the front and yet high-rise 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 six of them left Ricci 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 that instance on the bar always touch each other 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880
 stand together too 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.420
 ajax that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530
 during the match more and more and the game came 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.020
 it is never again 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.120
 but once again a man from Schiedam made the short corner hard 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.170
 handsome rescue of the view at dam 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.210
 sort of half a blow because that of the brook on the pole 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.830
 9 others watch just after rest and saba lyon to the side and becomes 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.360
 replaced by the year in which also by ozone 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 the guardsmen who set up by the attack 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.380
 it looked too 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.409
 and nouri 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.909
 who sees in his eyes open the euros deal two minutes after being in the ad 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.159
 goals from 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.400
 Ajax has been lucky there, although it is an excellent attack and the cross of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.200
 desk zoom 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.830
 it is very dangerous and marquardt really can't do anything else with el idrissi 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.669
 in his back 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.669
 the lead is certainly earned 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.760
 was that i'm not saying go inside 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.309
 travels to the euro zone 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.209
 had the ball came by doortje and that with a shot 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.209
 blocked 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.919
 next ajax attack 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.309
 fire department on the left 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.249
 at nouri 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.369
 glory 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.119
 magnificent 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.389
 the cross 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.290
 to haggle 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.290
 finally watched the ball in the hands of 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.999
 but what is enjoying abdelhak nouri 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.450
 celtic still has a chance in the final phase, here the ball just goes 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.059
 examples by 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.259
 it's literally the last minute of the game and then 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.329
 the attempt just beside the goal of van leaves there ajax escapes through the 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.849
 Ajax's victory over Celtic is more than deserved 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.839
 I want is a way through the current quarter 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:30.819
 yes 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.440
 it's the first first competition to always win my dream 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.989
 and so important 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:36.969
 this year 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.589
 good start 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.319
 that is called substitute, I think there are some nice promotions sport nice talk 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.549
 well understood where the city was but it was not an easy match the kind 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.089
 expects celtic the compact 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.089
 react to the misunderstanding in wrong bronze 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.879
 they also became dangerous a few times, but luckily we were better 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.089
 creating better football through your own chances 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.649
 but with a bit of luck, one also grabbed the open two 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:08.149
 but many opportunities were needed to score goals it is it is 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.879
 Unfortunately 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.129
 it has now begun to have finally begun 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.599
 yeah sure nice clubs 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.159
 With that you can make the internet 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.680
 also the world 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.320
 so you leave things even more often from thousands of weekend jaco the two 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.759
 competitions and try to come to think 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:26.349
 7
