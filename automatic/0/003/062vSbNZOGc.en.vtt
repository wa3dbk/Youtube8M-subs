00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
in mind that was really my only nitpick

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.750 
in mind that was really my only nitpick
with<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.169> jacket<00:03:16.500> itself<00:03:16.769> or<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.519> even

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
with the jacket itself or really even

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.430 
with the jacket itself or really even
with<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.000> sizing<00:03:18.419> was<00:03:18.659> a<00:03:18.810> little<00:03:19.229> bit<00:03:19.319> of

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
with the sizing was a little bit of

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.719 
with the sizing was a little bit of
breathing<00:03:19.650> room<00:03:19.829> when<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.129> add<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.280> armor

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
breathing room when you add that armor

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.490 
breathing room when you add that armor
in<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.060> elbows<00:03:21.359> would<00:03:21.810> go<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> long<00:03:22.290> way

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
in and the elbows would go a long way

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.259 
in and the elbows would go a long way
but<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:22.949> that<00:03:23.069> tailored<00:03:23.370> fit<00:03:23.549> now<00:03:23.909> remember
