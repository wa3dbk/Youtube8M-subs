just a tiny bit too small for this you
know<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.640> really<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.270> scale<00:02:45.540> up<00:02:45.750> because

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
know it's not really to scale up because

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.020 
know it's not really to scale up because
it's<00:02:46.530> down<00:02:46.709> here<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.069> equip<00:02:47.459> more<00:02:47.700> towards

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
it's down here on the equip more towards

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.390 
it's down here on the equip more towards
the<00:02:48.120> equator<00:02:48.239> now<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.140> picture<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:50.160> where

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the equator now in this picture or where

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.150 
the equator now in this picture or where
it<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.730> google<00:02:51.209> or<00:02:51.390> word<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.260> today<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
it is on google or word is today on the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.370 
it is on google or word is today on the
map<00:02:53.340> whatever<00:02:53.819> it's<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.140> bigger

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
map whatever it's a little bit bigger

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.320 
map whatever it's a little bit bigger
than<00:02:55.590> what<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.160> here<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.030> fits

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
than what I have up here but this fits

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.970 
than what I have up here but this fits
this<00:02:57.540> way<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.810> I'm<00:02:58.080> leaving<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.650> way<00:02:58.830> i'm

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this way so I'm leaving it this way i'm

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.680 
this way so I'm leaving it this way i'm
not<00:02:59.100> going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.250> change<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
not going to change it to see that that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.920 
not going to change it to see that that
is<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.830> same<00:03:02.069> thing<00:03:02.150> he<00:03:03.150> knows<00:03:03.390> I'm<00:03:03.600> show<00:03:03.840> it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
is the same thing he knows I'm show it

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.390 
is the same thing he knows I'm show it
the<00:03:04.020> very<00:03:04.200> next<00:03:04.380> day<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:04.920> said<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.280> would

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the very next day like I said it would

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.690 
the very next day like I said it would
show<00:03:05.550> itself<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.150> orders<00:03:06.989> today<00:03:07.550> let's<00:03:08.550> check

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
show itself in orders today let's check

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.420 
show itself in orders today let's check
out<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.910> google<00:03:09.090> earth<00:03:09.390> whether<00:03:11.390> she<00:03:12.390> chose

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:26.010 

time<00:03:15.609> you'll<00:03:15.790> often<00:03:16.060> different<00:03:16.989> spot<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.409> it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020 

and<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.710> doesn't<00:03:27.280> show<00:03:27.460> that<00:03:27.610> beautiful

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
and so that doesn't show that beautiful

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.360 
and so that doesn't show that beautiful
pattern<00:03:28.360> like<00:03:28.480> us<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.840> one<00:03:28.990> of<00:03:29.020> matt's<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
pattern like us on one of matt's it's a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.580 
pattern like us on one of matt's it's a
little<00:03:30.550> bit<00:03:30.640> turn<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.390> that's<00:03:31.600> that's<00:03:32.410> all

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
little bit turn so that's that's all

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.760 
little bit turn so that's that's all
right<00:03:32.710> good<00:03:33.810> still<00:03:34.810> fits<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.170> receipt<00:03:35.530> still

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
right good still fits the receipt still

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.300 
right good still fits the receipt still
fits<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:37.420> part<00:03:37.630> should

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
fits this part should

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.360 
fits this part should
a<00:03:40.080> couple<00:03:41.080> things<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.410> change<00:03:41.860> but<00:03:42.130> I'm<00:03:42.220> not

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
a couple things to change but I'm not

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.410 
a couple things to change but I'm not
going<00:03:42.520> to<00:03:42.580> change<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.970> because<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.300> can

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
going to change it because you can

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.410 
going to change it because you can
already<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.349> I<00:03:44.650> mean<00:03:45.640> it's<00:03:46.030> it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
already see that this is I mean it's it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.309 
already see that this is I mean it's it
is<00:03:46.599> really<00:03:46.870> nice<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.470> Sultan<00:03:47.709> misalignment

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
is really nice the Sultan misalignment

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.880 
is really nice the Sultan misalignment
ones<00:03:50.319> like

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
ones like

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.890 
ones like
I<00:03:50.920> was<00:03:51.069> on<00:03:51.220> right<00:03:51.400> there

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.410 

plus<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.650> noticed<00:03:59.980> one<00:04:00.610> thing<00:04:00.640> yesterday<00:04:01.060> when

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
plus I noticed one thing yesterday when

plus I noticed one thing yesterday when
I<00:04:01.480> brought<00:04:01.659> up<00:04:01.720> those<00:04:01.930> tube<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.470> crater

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
I brought up those tube this crater

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.520 
I brought up those tube this crater
let's<00:04:03.970> check<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.209> with<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.599> weather<00:04:05.260> there

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
let's check that with this weather there

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.369 
let's check that with this weather there
is<00:04:05.709> turn<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.069> off<00:04:06.420> turn<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:07.569> off<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.140> turn

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
is turn this off turn this off and turn

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.699 
is turn this off turn this off and turn
that<00:04:08.530> weather<00:04:08.799> back<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:10.349> yeah<00:04:11.349> see<00:04:11.590> because

that weather back on yeah see because
this<00:04:12.099> is<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.269> small<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.750> way<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:13.989> is

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
this is this is small the way it is

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.630 
this is this is small the way it is
right<00:04:14.230> here<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.680> look<00:04:14.920> at<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.129> look<00:04:15.400> how<00:04:15.459> it

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
right here and look at that look how it

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.189 
right here and look at that look how it
fits<00:04:15.849> there<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.209> did<00:04:16.359> not<00:04:16.539> line<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
fits there I did not line this to the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.990 
fits there I did not line this to the
crater<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.620> just<00:04:17.799> see<00:04:17.949> me<00:04:17.979> do<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.789> just

seen me do this just watch me do it

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.900 
seen me do this just watch me do it
check<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.139> out<00:04:25.710> see<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> crater

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
check it out see the crater

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.850 
check it out see the crater
look<00:04:29.420> at<00:04:29.570> area<00:04:29.870> rather<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.200> craters<00:04:30.560> look<00:04:30.770> at

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
look at area rather the craters look at

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.770 
look at area rather the craters look at
that<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.490> then<00:04:31.610> see<00:04:31.820> this<00:04:31.970> this<00:04:32.330> area<00:04:32.630> here

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
that and then see this this area here

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.890 
that and then see this this area here
it's<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.320> same<00:04:34.000> saying

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.719 

there's<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.530> shape<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:40.100> point<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.520> comes

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
there's that shape that point that comes

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.850 
there's that shape that point that comes
down<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.090> point<00:04:41.300> right<00:04:41.419> there<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:42.710> is

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
down to the point right there this is

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.439 
down to the point right there this is
the<00:04:42.979> East<00:04:43.130> Coast<00:04:43.340> 12<00:04:43.759> this<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.030> not<00:04:44.180> even<00:04:44.389> the

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
the East Coast 12 this is not even the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.960 
the East Coast 12 this is not even the
faultline<00:04:44.960> moon<00:04:45.229> so<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.160> shows<00:04:46.370> that<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.759> got

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
faultline moon so it shows that it's got

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.150 
faultline moon so it shows that it's got
we<00:04:47.240> got<00:04:47.389> two<00:04:47.690> impacts<00:04:48.169> by<00:04:48.380> this<00:04:48.560> crater<00:04:48.860> on<00:04:49.100> the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
we got two impacts by this crater on the

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.700 
we got two impacts by this crater on the
east<00:04:49.430> coast<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:50.030> moved<00:04:50.500> because<00:04:51.500> this

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
east coast or it moved because this

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.430
