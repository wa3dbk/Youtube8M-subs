start of this video I actually decided

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
start of this video I actually decided
to<00:01:15.330> bring<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> bouffant<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.439> Chiellini<00:01:17.100> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
fortunately he managed to actually

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410

first<00:02:26.760> corner<00:02:27.210> he<00:02:27.630> might<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:28.080> himself

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
first corner he might get himself
