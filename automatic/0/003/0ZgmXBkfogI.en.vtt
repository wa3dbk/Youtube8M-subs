around<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.590> pillar<00:01:19.330> roll<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.480> up<00:01:20.660> like<00:01:20.810> so

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
around the pillar roll it up like so

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.639 
around the pillar roll it up like so
towards<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.619> just<00:01:23.649> look<00:01:24.219> this<00:01:24.780> hotel<00:01:25.780> to

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
towards you just look this hotel to

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.649 
towards you just look this hotel to
secure<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.189> CRO<00:01:27.399> reason<00:01:27.700> why<00:01:27.850> I'm<00:01:28.090> not<00:01:28.329> really

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
secure the CRO reason why I'm not really

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.690 
secure the CRO reason why I'm not really
all<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.229> way<00:01:29.350> up<00:01:29.560> it's<00:01:29.770> because<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.340> don't<00:01:30.399> have

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
all the way up it's because I don't have

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.669 
all the way up it's because I don't have
enough<00:01:30.969> curlers<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.689> go<00:01:31.840> all<00:01:32.049> of<00:01:32.079> it<00:01:32.380> around

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
enough curlers to go all of it around

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.010 
enough curlers to go all of it around
using<00:01:32.920> smaller<00:01:33.549> sections<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.210> hair<00:01:34.390> and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
using smaller sections of hair and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.109 
using smaller sections of hair and
number<00:01:35.259> two<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.950> think<00:01:36.219> that<00:01:36.429> it<00:01:36.969> will

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
number two I just think that it will

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.999 
number two I just think that it will
look<00:01:37.299> more<00:01:37.539> natural<00:01:37.600> anyways<00:01:38.380> just<00:01:38.409> like<00:01:38.829> when

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
look more natural anyways just like when

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.289 
look more natural anyways just like when
you<00:01:39.100> don't<00:01:39.280> go<00:01:39.369> all<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.640> way<00:01:39.729> up<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.149> your

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
you don't go all the way up to your

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.139 
you don't go all the way up to your
scalp<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.319> let's<00:01:41.470> do<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.829> other<00:01:41.860> side<00:01:42.149> same

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
scalp so let's do the other side same

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.719 
scalp so let's do the other side same
thing<00:01:43.179> I'm<00:01:43.659> gonna<00:01:43.780> have<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.619> side<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
thing I'm gonna have the side with the

00:01:45.729 --> 00:02:02.719 
thing I'm gonna have the side with the
holes<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.890> tour<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.310> outside

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.910 

now<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> take<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.380> smaller<00:02:05.039> one

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
now I'm going to take a smaller one

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.150 
now I'm going to take a smaller one
yeah

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
yeah

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.550 
yeah
do<00:02:09.490> that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.370 

we<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.520> too<00:02:17.670> much<00:02:17.790> hair<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.959> just

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
we have too much hair it's not it's just

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.130 
we have too much hair it's not it's just
gonna<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.830> fall<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> high

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
gonna like fall out so it's like a high

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.010 
gonna like fall out so it's like a high
as<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:22.740> with<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> smaller<00:02:23.250> ones<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
as I can go with the smaller ones I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.740 
as I can go with the smaller ones I
think<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.560> probably<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:27.030> best<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
think this is probably the best for a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
think this is probably the best for a
shorter<00:02:28.230> hair<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.250> not<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.700> that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
shorter hair because I'm not at all that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.820 
shorter hair because I'm not at all that
much<00:02:30.120> unless<00:02:30.270> you're<00:02:30.959> willing<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.260> buy<00:02:31.770> two

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
much unless you're willing to buy two

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.979 
much unless you're willing to buy two
sets<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.490> these<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> use<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.660> smaller

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
sets of these and use get smaller

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:43.900 
sets of these and use get smaller
sections<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.620> hair

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.910 

it's<00:02:44.330> not<00:02:44.540> really<00:02:44.780> holding<00:02:45.020> see<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.710> just

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
it's not really holding see it just

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.910 
it's not really holding see it just
falls<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:49.670> that's<00:02:49.820> CLT<00:02:50.540> work<00:02:50.750> sooner<00:02:51.680> mix

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
falls out but that's CLT work sooner mix

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.820 
falls out but that's CLT work sooner mix
it<00:02:52.070> up<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.310> little<00:02:52.490> bit<00:02:52.820> using<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.410> use<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
it up a little bit using see I use the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.260 
it up a little bit using see I use the
smaller<00:02:55.070> ones<00:02:55.310> here<00:02:55.430> I'm<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.090> take

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
smaller ones here I'm just going to take

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:06.250 
smaller ones here I'm just going to take
some<00:02:56.300> big<00:02:56.630> ones<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.740> do<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> next<00:02:58.430> section

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.720 

so<00:03:07.129> just<00:03:07.370> use

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
so just use

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.060 
so just use
same<00:03:08.060> technique<00:03:08.569> all<00:03:08.930> throughout<00:03:09.940> not

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.260 

be<00:03:15.070> kind<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.460> careful<00:03:15.700> with<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.210> because

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
be kind of careful with these because

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.350 
be kind of careful with these because
the<00:03:17.170> ginger<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> silicon<00:03:18.730> material

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
the ginger is like a silicon material

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.140 
the ginger is like a silicon material
and<00:03:19.720> inline<00:03:20.620> like<00:03:21.490> if<00:03:21.610> you're<00:03:21.730> not<00:03:21.760> careful

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
and inline like if you're not careful

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.320 
and inline like if you're not careful
you<00:03:22.570> might<00:03:23.130> accidentally<00:03:24.130> grate<00:03:24.730> some<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.180> you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
you might accidentally grate some of you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.110 
you might accidentally grate some of you
here<00:03:25.540> by<00:03:25.930> attaching<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:27.040> together<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.940> kind

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
here by attaching it together it's kind

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.150 
here by attaching it together it's kind
of<00:03:28.240> sticky<00:03:28.660> but<00:03:28.960> it's<00:03:29.110> not<00:03:29.380> sticking<00:03:29.830> that

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
of sticky but it's not sticking that

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.430 
of sticky but it's not sticking that
makes<00:03:30.790> sense<00:03:31.240> that<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.690> kind<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.930> catches<00:03:32.290> on

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
makes sense that like kind of catches on

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.020 
makes sense that like kind of catches on
to<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.710> here<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.220> just<00:03:33.250> kind<00:03:33.520> of<00:03:33.550> pulls<00:03:33.820> it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
to you here and it just kind of pulls it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.540 
to you here and it just kind of pulls it
so<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.780> have<00:03:34.960> to<00:03:35.110> be<00:03:35.230> careful<00:03:35.710> with<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.400> way

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
so you have to be careful with the way

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.250 
so you have to be careful with the way
your<00:03:36.700> handle<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.480> with<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:37.840> last

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
your handle that and with this last

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.070 
your handle that and with this last
section<00:03:38.830> back<00:03:39.340> here<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:39.970> they<00:03:40.090> try<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.630> fit

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
section back here so they try to fit

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:50.600 
section back here so they try to fit
everything<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.710> want<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.190> live

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.490 

this<00:03:50.970> realized<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.660> don't<00:03:51.720> even<00:03:52.020> have<00:03:52.380> enough

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
bit of weight litora disappointed i

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.629 
bit of weight litora disappointed i
think<00:06:50.469> maybe<00:06:50.620> i<00:06:50.740> didn't<00:06:50.919> curl<00:06:51.159> it<00:06:51.310> right<00:06:51.520> or

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
think maybe i didn't curl it right or

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.350 
think maybe i didn't curl it right or
something<00:06:52.090> but<00:06:52.530> yeah<00:06:53.530> I<00:06:54.009> think<00:06:54.969> these<00:06:55.150> are

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
something but yeah I think these are

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.350
