00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.389
 hi to all and axel tests mobile.fr 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.289
 we are at mwc 2014 on the stand of lg 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.670
 I have in front of me the lg she 40 then 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.980
 it's actually they're 40 it's the new 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.700
 at 40 this is the first device 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.820
 the new series 3 her series 3 including 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.550
 which is called more l2 l3 20 to behold 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.380
 they spent l 40 she then I believe 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 that it is she 70 and 80 and there are some 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 others too, but we will not have 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.530
 necessarily in France then it's the 46 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.510
 a device that will cost 99 euros naked so 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.079
 it is an entry-level device under 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.450
 android 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.790
 it happened in March of April and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.340
 potentially dual sim in france but 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.890
 we are not sure yet of his rating and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.720
 speck on what we have a tiny screen 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.300
 so small yes small screen of 3.5 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.190
 inch seduces ps 440 by 320 we have a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 1.2 gigahertz dual core processor 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.320
 we have a battery of 1600 million 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 miles then there are two versions the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 dual sim version its 1700 there is a 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 triple sim version at 1540 mines and in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.820
 loses I think we will have the version 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 dual sim that's for sure so we will not have 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.760
 no triple sim triple version 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.440
 the application is what we will have 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.700
 potential single version here but I am 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.990
 not sure they exist in single sing 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 really seems to me that on the wings 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.180
 l 3 that's because of the dual sim we have a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.680
 3 megapixel camera at the back 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 it runs under android kit kat 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 and then we have like on all 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 terminals she series and f series the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.619
 system of nok code you make a 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 kind of code that's where the evolution of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.180
 our columns that you know and who 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.799
 allows you to unlock the device with 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.909
 a code then sorry for the reflections I 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.740
 will try to make sure that we 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.060
 do not see too much reflections but it's a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.619
 uncomplicated there is a lot of light 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.299
 around us it's nice but it's 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.189
 true that it's not practical sometimes 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.580
 design side you see it's some 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.070
 very classic very classic thing 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.229
 but that makes it pretty good visually 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 she I started a little bit optimized 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.310
 at small it's design even for its 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 diane input terminals so that's 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.990
 rather nice there we see the sensor the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.549
 logo lg audio output tray menu home 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.430
 physical buttons that come out of the 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.020
 everything will be seen if it's a problem at 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.430
 use the on / off button lock 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.100
 unlock that seems not spring 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.700
 really 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.380
 the back shell is removable wait 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.160
 I'm going to maybe if I take it off it's going 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.160
 sound no am I not do it jack 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.470
 micro usb volume in the interface we are going 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.270
 move quickly enough and I'm going elsewhere 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.270
 process that way 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.270
 here 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.020
 I will put myself like this we see 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.200
 not too small reflections then 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 telephone devices multi contacts 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.280
 tasks 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.660
 that's all pretty classic like that 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.830
 so there is a little less 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.360
 features necessarily that in the 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.450
 overlay on the terminals a little 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.140
 better spec and especially the f-16 or g2 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.910
 mining etc. 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.560
 but it takes the same spirit in all 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.870
 the cases it seems to turn pretty well 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.470
 there as I handle the menu 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.970
 main 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.730
 the messaging contact widgets just see 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.780
 the tech input what does it look like on a 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.490
 screen of this size 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.110
 we got a little small 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.450
 actually you may have 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.560
 trend has shifted into landscape but he 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.960
 there is not much room where so 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 this is the kind of thing to note 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.260
 on screens of this size 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.330
 especially since you see keyboard there 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.410
 is still quite bulky but 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.760
 you can still install one 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.620
 other if you are not satisfied with 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.230
 this one hop here we are in I'm watching 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.990
 if there are some cool little things 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 schedule yeah you'll keep the 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.580
 maybe the camera quickly 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.460
 see if at the interface a little bit 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.880
 specific we have a lot of options here 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.490
 chatr so you say cheese it takes the 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.910
 photo takes pictures so in 3 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:02.130
 megapixels can adjust the brightness 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.390
 white bounce iso yeah me a lot of 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.630
 little tricks we can switch to mode 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.630
 video 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.650
 and here not to a double v in w a ok I 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.819
 think we did pretty much turns 1 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.400
 it's a small input device 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.989
 range not very expensive so why not at 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.519
 see if it has integrated by the operators 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.590
 it could be interesting even in u 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.139
 for the market without commitment why 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.600
 not to start in the universe 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.750
 wonderful smartphones here go 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.750
 see you soon
