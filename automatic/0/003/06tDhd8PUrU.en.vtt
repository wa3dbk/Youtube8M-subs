in the malted barley yeah get converted

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
in the malted barley yeah get converted
into<00:00:48.390> sugars<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.680> did<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.160> pour<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
into sugars now did you just pour that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.889 
into sugars now did you just pour that
is<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.090> water<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.750> now

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is it just water in there right now

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
is it just water in there right now
there's<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.410> okay<00:00:52.829> hot<00:00:53.129> water<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.969> we

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's just one okay hot water and we

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.150 
there's just one okay hot water and we
shoot<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.350> temperature<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.329> 150<00:00:57.329> to

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
shoot for a temperature of about 150 to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
shoot for a temperature of about 150 to
150<00:00:59.160> 4<00:00:59.370> degrees<00:00:59.699> okay<00:01:00.000> okay<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> like

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
150 4 degrees okay okay this is like

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
150 4 degrees okay okay this is like
cream<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> wheat<00:01:01.289> why<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> kid

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
cream of wheat why you see it as a kid

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
cream of wheat why you see it as a kid
and<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.539> some<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:03.930> different

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and so I have some of these different

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530 
and so I have some of these different
malts<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.360> particular

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
malts up here and in this particular

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
malts up here and in this particular
base<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.140> would<00:01:07.380> change<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.430> with

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
base so we would change this out with

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.370 
base so we would change this out with
one<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> those<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.240> wanted<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
one of those we wanted to do right and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.570 
one of those we wanted to do right and
if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> did<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
if you did that then you would get a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
if you did that then you would get a
different<00:01:11.820> different<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.750> beer<00:01:12.990> gotcha

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
different different kind of beer gotcha

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
different different kind of beer gotcha
now<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> hops<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now these are this is the hops is that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.929 
now these are this is the hops is that
right<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> combination<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
right this is a combination this is the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.200 
right this is a combination this is the
this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.450> called<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> word<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this is called the word and this is the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.649 
this is called the word and this is the
sugar<00:01:21.990> liquid<00:01:22.380> we've<00:01:22.860> moved<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.659> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
sugar liquid we've moved over here and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.620 
sugar liquid we've moved over here and
some<00:01:25.170> hops<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.580> hops<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
some hops and what hops do is how to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
some hops and what hops do is how to
give<00:01:27.990> beer<00:01:28.229> bitterness<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
give beer bitterness so you have the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
give beer bitterness so you have the
sweetness<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> malt<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
sweetness of the malt and then you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.899 
sweetness of the malt and then you
balance<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> bitterness<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
balance it with the bitterness of the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.630 
balance it with the bitterness of the
hops<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.689> telling<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
hops now you're telling me this is a
