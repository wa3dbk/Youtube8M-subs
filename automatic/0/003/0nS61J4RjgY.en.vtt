we<00:00:02.010> are<00:00:02.129> looking<00:00:02.370> at<00:00:02.520> fuel<00:00:02.909> pump<00:00:03.240> current<00:00:03.659> here

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
we are looking at fuel pump current here

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.730 
we are looking at fuel pump current here
on<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.950> oscilloscope<00:00:05.609> today<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.690> what<00:00:07.620> you

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
on the oscilloscope today and what you

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.290 
on the oscilloscope today and what you
can<00:00:07.890> see<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.189> we've<00:00:08.400> got<00:00:08.580> about<00:00:08.790> nine<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.090> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
can see is we've got about nine and a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.629 
can see is we've got about nine and a
half<00:00:09.330> amps<00:00:09.900> or<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.160> being<00:00:11.400> used<00:00:11.580> by

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
half amps or so that are being used by

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.890 
half amps or so that are being used by
the<00:00:11.730> fuel<00:00:12.000> pump<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.570> 2003<00:00:13.380> Chevy<00:00:13.830> truck

as<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.049> know<00:00:16.490> Chevy<00:00:17.490> trucks<00:00:18.029> well<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> lot<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
as you know Chevy trucks well a lot of

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.800 
as you know Chevy trucks well a lot of
GM<00:00:19.109> stuff<00:00:19.439> has<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> tendency<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.910> lose<00:00:21.449> fuel

pumps<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:23.160> particular<00:00:23.580> pattern<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.119> good

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
pumps this particular pattern is a good

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.769 
pumps this particular pattern is a good
pattern<00:00:25.519> before<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:27.029> fuel<00:00:27.390> pump<00:00:27.420> was

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
pattern before this fuel pump was

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.800 
pattern before this fuel pump was
replaced<00:00:28.460> here<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.300> last<00:00:30.480> couple<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
replaced here in the last couple of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
replaced here in the last couple of
hours<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.949> were<00:00:32.130> looking<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.149> current

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
hours we were looking at the the current

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
hours we were looking at the the current
ramp<00:00:33.980> before<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.370> actually<00:00:35.550> looked

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
ramp before and it actually looked

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
ramp before and it actually looked
flying<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.739> were<00:00:37.920> using<00:00:38.219> about<00:00:38.430> twelve

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
flying but we were using about twelve

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.630 
flying but we were using about twelve
and<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> half<00:00:39.180> amps<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.960> our-our<00:00:40.950> amperage<00:00:41.399> has

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and a half amps so our-our amperage has

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.990 
and a half amps so our-our amperage has
come<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.370> test<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
come down this is a really good test a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
come down this is a really good test a
really<00:00:45.180> good<00:00:45.360> thing<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.930> generally

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
really good thing to do generally

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
really good thing to do generally
speaking<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> should<00:00:48.780> say<00:00:48.960> with

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
speaking and well or I should say with

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
speaking and well or I should say with
some<00:00:49.260> other<00:00:49.410> fuel<00:00:49.710> pumps<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.100> I've<00:00:50.219> tested

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
some other fuel pumps that I've tested

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.939 
some other fuel pumps that I've tested
on<00:00:51.210> GM<00:00:51.690> products<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
on GM products when you get in the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.860 
on GM products when you get in the
neighbor<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> twelve<00:00:53.579> amps<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.570> could

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
neighbor of the twelve amps you could

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.250 
neighbor of the twelve amps you could
have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> problem<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> anyway<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.050> we've

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
have a problem so anyway the way we've

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.209 
have a problem so anyway the way we've
got<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> hooked<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.070> is<00:01:00.469> right<00:01:01.469> over<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.920> at

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
got this hooked up is right over here at

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.719 
got this hooked up is right over here at
the<00:01:02.370> fuse<00:01:02.670> box<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the fuse box you can see we have this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.660 
the fuse box you can see we have this
little<00:01:05.970> adapter<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.560> plugged<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.430> where

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
little adapter that is plugged in where

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359 
little adapter that is plugged in where
the<00:01:08.820> fuel<00:01:09.060> pump<00:01:09.299> relay<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.830> adapter

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the fuel pump relay is so this adapter

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.640 
the fuel pump relay is so this adapter
here<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> pull<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> fuse<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:13.320> put<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
here you pull the fuse out we put the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830 
here you pull the fuse out we put the
fuel<00:01:13.920> pump<00:01:14.189> views<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.390> into<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
fuel pump views right here into the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469 
fuel pump views right here into the
adapter<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.700> our<00:01:17.939> low<00:01:18.150> amps

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
adapter and then we have our low amps

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.140 
adapter and then we have our low amps
probe<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.080> clamped<00:01:19.470> around<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.890> wire<00:01:20.189> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
probe just clamped around that wire so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
probe just clamped around that wire so
the<00:01:21.270> way<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.509> works<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> current

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the way this works is all the current

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
the way this works is all the current
that<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> flowing<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> fuel<00:01:24.330> pump<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that is flowing to the fuel pump is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
that is flowing to the fuel pump is
flowing<00:01:25.049> through<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> wire<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.909> our

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
flowing through this wire and then our

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.380 
flowing through this wire and then our
our<00:01:27.119> amp<00:01:27.479> clamp<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.080> able<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:29.040> able<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.180> read

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
our amp clamp is able to is able to read

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.380 
our amp clamp is able to is able to read
that<00:01:31.040> by<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.610> clamping<00:01:33.030> around<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that by just just clamping around the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.260 
that by just just clamping around the
wire<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.000> we're

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
wire so that that's where we are we're

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.219 
wire so that that's where we are we're
measuring<00:01:36.570> our<00:01:37.530> current<00:01:38.159> back<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:40.170> our

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
measuring our current back here on our

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
measuring our current back here on our
oscilloscope<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.119> on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
oscilloscope you can see down there on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.780 
oscilloscope you can see down there on
channel<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.619> our<00:01:43.649> leads<00:01:44.009> set<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.610> low

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
channel one we have our leads set to low

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.149 
channel one we have our leads set to low
amps<00:01:45.180> 20<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.500> we're<00:01:46.680> looking<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:47.040> about

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
amps 20 and then we're looking at about

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
amps 20 and then we're looking at about
the<00:01:47.399> 20<00:01:47.700> amp<00:01:47.880> scale<00:01:48.240> since<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.890> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the 20 amp scale since we're you know in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
the 20 amp scale since we're you know in
the<00:01:50.070> neighborhood<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.490> 9<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.420> 10<00:01:51.659> amps<00:01:51.950> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the neighborhood of 9 to 10 amps and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
the neighborhood of 9 to 10 amps and
that's<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.790> need<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that's all we need now if this if this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
that's all we need now if this if this
pattern<00:01:55.439> was<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.610> bad<00:01:56.790> you'd<00:01:57.090> see<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
pattern was was really bad you'd see a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.200 
pattern was was really bad you'd see a
lot<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.740> up-and-down<00:01:58.850> variations<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
lot of up-and-down variations if the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
lot of up-and-down variations if the
pump<00:02:00.450> was<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.960> binding<00:02:01.259> internally<00:02:02.040> or

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
pump was was binding internally or

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.080 
pump was was binding internally or
something<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.049> pump<00:02:04.320> was

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
something like that or if the pump was

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
something like that or if the pump was
let's<00:02:06.090> say<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> pump<00:02:06.719> had<00:02:06.990> high<00:02:07.229> resistance

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
let's say the pump had high resistance

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.590 
let's say the pump had high resistance
in<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
in the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.570 
in the
in<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.810> commutator<00:02:09.380> in<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:09.740> brushes<00:02:10.160> this

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
in the commutator in the brushes this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.430 
in the commutator in the brushes this
this<00:02:10.910> amperage<00:02:11.420> number<00:02:11.750> would<00:02:11.870> be<00:02:11.930> something

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
this amperage number would be something

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.120 
this amperage number would be something
much<00:02:13.040> much<00:02:13.280> lower<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
much much lower so this is this is a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.820 
much much lower so this is this is a
good<00:02:16.400> pattern<00:02:16.640> here<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.810> good<00:02:18.110> amount

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
good pattern here this is a good amount

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.160 
good pattern here this is a good amount
of<00:02:18.980> current<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.550> we're<00:02:19.700> seeing<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.990> come

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
of current that we're seeing you come

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.620 
of current that we're seeing you come
over<00:02:21.380> here<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.800> look<00:02:22.190> at<00:02:22.310> our<00:02:22.400> gauge<00:02:22.670> our

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
over here and you look at our gauge our

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.560 
over here and you look at our gauge our
pressure<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.140> supposed<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> be<00:02:24.710> 56<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.880> 62<00:02:26.540> and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
pressure is supposed to be 56 to 62 and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.250 
pressure is supposed to be 56 to 62 and
we're<00:02:27.070> we're<00:02:28.070> there<00:02:28.570> we're<00:02:29.570> right<00:02:29.780> there

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
we're we're there we're right there

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.910 
we're we're there we're right there
so<00:02:30.800> measuring<00:02:31.670> current<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.510> fuel<00:02:32.750> pump

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
so measuring current to the fuel pump

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.390 
so measuring current to the fuel pump
very<00:02:33.920> very<00:02:34.280> useful<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:36.110> very<00:02:36.590> good<00:02:36.800> thing<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.040> do

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
very very useful a very good thing to do

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.530 
very very useful a very good thing to do
a<00:02:37.700> very<00:02:38.390> good<00:02:38.450> way<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.280> determine<00:02:40.540> what's

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
a very good way to determine what's

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.900 
a very good way to determine what's
going<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.470> fuel<00:02:42.740> pump<00:02:42.950> when<00:02:43.580> when

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
going on in a fuel pump when when

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.210 
going on in a fuel pump when when
pressure<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.510> volume<00:02:44.660> look<00:02:45.110> good<00:02:45.410> it's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
pressure and volume look good it's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.110 
pressure and volume look good it's
always<00:02:46.460> good<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> do<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:48.290> do<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.880> current<00:02:49.880> ramp

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
always good to do a to do a current ramp

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.270 
always good to do a to do a current ramp
or<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.690> desculpe<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> current<00:02:51.980> with<00:02:52.160> an

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
or to desculpe the current with an

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.340 
or to desculpe the current with an
oscilloscope<00:02:52.660> having<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:53.810> little<00:02:54.170> loop

very<00:02:56.240> very<00:02:56.510> handy<00:02:56.900> when<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:57.830> fuel<00:02:58.070> pump<00:02:58.280> used

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
very very handy when the fuel pump used

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.700 
very very handy when the fuel pump used
is<00:02:58.760> found<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.570> under<00:02:59.810> hood<00:02:59.960> use<00:03:00.680> a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
is found in the the under hood use a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.370 
is found in the the under hood use a
relay<00:03:01.130> box<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:02.570> if<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.930> an<00:03:03.080> oscilloscope

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
relay box so if you have an oscilloscope

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.220 
relay box so if you have an oscilloscope
you<00:03:03.770> don't<00:03:04.040> have<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> low<00:03:04.430> amps<00:03:04.990> clamp<00:03:05.990> like

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
you don't have a low amps clamp like

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.100 
you don't have a low amps clamp like
like<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.650> one<00:03:06.860> here<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.940> would<00:03:08.630> definitely

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
like this one here I would definitely

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.530 
like this one here I would definitely
suggest<00:03:09.290> getting<00:03:09.800> one<00:03:10.390> because<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.510> is

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
suggest getting one because it is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.320 
suggest getting one because it is
something<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.990> is<00:03:12.440> definitely<00:03:13.330> quite

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
something that is definitely quite

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.840 
something that is definitely quite
useful
