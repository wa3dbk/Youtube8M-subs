00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.849
 be careful not to be named specified that in mid-May did you know

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 in the future retaining his jersey the opportunity to address his neighbors 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 but we do not want any benefits 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.450
 people who have 60% of the reserves 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.860
 I do not think so 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 crossroads look 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.090
 then at the sorbonne on a trip to spain at the airports 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.060
 for his coach 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 the raised funds had then allowed the demand to the inverted after there

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.329
 three missiles hit baghdad that had been brought closer to primary

 there is finally this pool of aces for perfumes with the princely formation 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 Damascus housing market 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.020
 then 8 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 and after his reminders 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 enjoy the slf 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.250
 it's trying to grab to share the love of reading the moral report 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.609
 and nuclear material a friend reported the wonderful arrangement 2008 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.620
 no doubt I will finish his opponents 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.180
 Let's go 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.919
 placed in the wake of his figures 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.229
 14th 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.229
 it happened to him 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.559

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.919
 in the long run its run in the landscape was superb 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.919
 but the busy did not stay there that's exactly it 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.789
 four annual sessions

 tyler hamilton 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.179

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.689
 it feels like he's taking care 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.129
 France - the mountain 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.129
 and maybe these reciprocal 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.029
 it would be the moment and the risk 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.789
 for trust that's it my time at the latter of these structures 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.789

 in the future he is tired at night you may have trouble leaving again 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.829
 that's what did 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.349
 it is obviously the pr 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.699
 two opposing ball losses 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.150
