00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.509
 fresh herbs for your own kitchen ob 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.700
 bought or grown for many 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.770
 a pleasure for agricultural 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.420
 families offers their own large garden 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.580
 for that the best conditions 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.310
 so also with family romp from the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.570
 Saterland was in her garden during 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.250
 a herbal seminar 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.890
 Lower Saxony Chamber of Agriculture 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.199
 herb spiral created for karin romp 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.390
 a heart of her 3000 square meters 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.669
 great paradise i love mine 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.619
 herbal spiral in the spring through this 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.530
 first green what turns out 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.740
 lemon balm through the flowers 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.450
 This scent when the sun in the summer 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.540
 it seems smells of the garden this 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.600
 whole garden corner smells of thyme 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.280
 Marjoram now in mid-July is the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.260
 chives have already faded but 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.750
 The lavender lures with its remaining flowering 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.970
 not only bees and bumblebees and the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.040
 Marjoram stands in fragrant splendor only 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.750
 three examples of plant diversity the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.620
 a herbal spiral in the smallest space 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.780
 can offer 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.030
 with habitats of damp and 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.909
 nutrient-rich in the lower to dry 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.560
 and nutrient-poor in the upper area 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.509
 when you build a herbal spiral 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.060
 you'd better stick it first 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.710
 once the diameter from here it is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.429
 just under three meters because of this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.049
 herbal spiral and then it's breaking ground 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.659
 deep first, the mother soil 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.929
 dumped just laid aside 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.890
 and the first row with stones 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.780
 all around too misplaced around the the form and 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.259
 set the size first 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.409
 can 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.299
 in this herbal spiral are old 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.789
 bricks have been used 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.119
 You can do it as well with rounds 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.009
 However, fieldstone try that is 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.530
 build with feldsticks something difficult 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.939
 because round stones are not so good 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.700
 stack on top of each other and not 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.770
 have quite as much stability when the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.090
 bottom stone row is lying around 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.060
 the first layer of sand incorporated 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.469
 as well as rubble and stones 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.119
 after that has been completed 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.310
 we have a bit of sand 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.549
 filled up and gradually again 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.800
 mother ground and always incorporated 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.170
 again with the stones 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.900
 topsoil and some sand behind fills 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.640
 while making sure not 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.980
 was built straight up but 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.440
 the form something funny up to 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.490
 So that means she is rejuvenating 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.710
 up something 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 as a result, herbal spirals get more 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.050
 Stability in the upper part of the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 herb spiral impoverishes the soil 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.650
 actually or should the soil be stronger 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.110
 that makes you feel impoverished 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.940
 by sanding the bottom of the soil 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.800
 mixed and practically lean and and 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.170
 nutrients poorer soil conditions 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.910
 that creates the mediterranean herbs so 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.250
 the here above in the upper region also 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.160
 stand like thyme sage and 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.350
 lavender they like that too 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.380
 that here the best location 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.910
 conditions have a pavement around 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.440
 the beet makes it possible to own one 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.300
 herbs even in damp weather 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.960
 reasonably dry foot too 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.090
 to reach 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.310
 karin thoben is now harvesting for 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.980
 lunch also her favorite herb 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.200
 Rosemary must with I take the russ 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.989
 Mary to all dark flesh varieties 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.820
 i also like to put it in bouquets 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.760
 bouquets with in between 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.860
 because of the fragrance and yes we are the whole 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.160
 Family are fans of rosemary 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.130
 potatoes than that it's our cloud 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.209
 memory and that's what gets up today 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.660
 the menu 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.220
 there are fresh cheese herbs which 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.900
 Thoben karin love is a herbal 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.850
 while cooking because the food is so 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.770
 they retain their own taste 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.810
 can save salt and if it is fast 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.700
 For example, she should go as well 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.739
 sketch enhances with the clenched 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.260
 loading of vitamins and minerals 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.450
 But the herbs also contain it 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.280
 through the so-called secondary 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.450
 plant substances act as herbs 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.120
 is healthier of them 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 known to boost the immune system 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.160
 that they have a positive influence 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.850

 risk for certain cancers 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.090
 to reduce and to those secondary 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.820
 plant material that's a big one 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.820
 This group includes certain ethereal ones 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.680
 Oils mucilage tannins and 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.340
 offer bitter substances of herbs 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.040

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.150
 Grown loud, it is said in the vernacular 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.910
 Much is based solely on 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.630
 experience in folk medicine 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.040

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.490
 herbs 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.550
 but surely is for example the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.290
 rosemary has a very soothing effect 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.900
 for example, at full feeling or 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.120
 in bloating or even in light 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.460
 cramping in the mark intestinal area so at 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.520
