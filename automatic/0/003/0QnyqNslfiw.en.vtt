 in the channel and that 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.530

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.449
 which includes new super mario bros view and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.159
 also mario kart wii that still 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.830
 we dragged from the wii console because it was 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.960
 a great success because we love everyone 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.380
 also to say that practically 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.090
 every month we try to organize stays 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.680
 tournaments or something fun so that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.740
 there can be feedback with all 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.470
 you so just be 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 Attentive because I can be a gamer 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 commentator 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.450
 a camera operator filmmaker everything 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 you want 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.409
 and at the same time 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.810
 so if you're fond of one of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.600
 these two games even more that can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.119
 get to come and you like a lot 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 nintendo and the games of mario because not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 doubt not a moment to subscribe to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.979

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.620
 seeing the other one we meet 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.700

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.700
 we basically find content 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.630
 I love projects of this size 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.550

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.510
