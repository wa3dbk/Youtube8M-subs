know you don't to cut your fingers so

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
know you don't to cut your fingers so
whenever<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.660> cut<00:00:27.810> vegetables<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
whenever you cut vegetables you like to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
whenever you cut vegetables you like to
pull<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.830> hands<00:00:29.039> back<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.060> created<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
pull your hands back so I have created a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
pull your hands back so I have created a
little<00:00:30.599> claw<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.830> what<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> do

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
little claw here so what I'm going to do

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.200 
little claw here so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:32.610> prep<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.899> eggplant<00:00:34.110> now<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> motion<00:00:35.489> for

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
is prep an eggplant now the motion for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869 
is prep an eggplant now the motion for
the<00:00:36.360> nakiri<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.530> up-and-down<00:00:38.070> motion

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the nakiri is an up-and-down motion

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.630 
the nakiri is an up-and-down motion
unlike<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> classic<00:00:40.350> western<00:00:41.100> style<00:00:41.430> knife

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
unlike a classic western style knife

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
unlike a classic western style knife
which<00:00:42.149> has<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> rocking<00:00:43.020> motion<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.129> I'm

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
which has a rocking motion so what I'm

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.040 
which has a rocking motion so what I'm
going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.850> remove<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.960> tip

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.060 

straight<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.440> motion<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:55.070> for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
straight up and down motion now for

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
straight up and down motion now for
eggplant<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> salt<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.719> what

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
eggplant you like to salt it so what

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.290 
eggplant you like to salt it so what
would<00:00:58.020> happen<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> would<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.219> scored

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.730 

and<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:06.390> notice<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.720> keep<00:01:06.900> holding<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.320> fingers

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and you notice I keep holding my fingers

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700 
and you notice I keep holding my fingers
back<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.360> glazing<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.690> knife<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.350> top<00:01:10.560> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
back I'm glazing the knife the top of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.710 
back I'm glazing the knife the top of
the<00:01:10.770> knife<00:01:10.890> over<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.310> knuckle<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:12.240> using<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the knife over my knuckle I'm using it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
the knife over my knuckle I'm using it
as<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> guideline<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:14.210> score<00:01:18.770> by<00:01:19.770> scoring<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
as a guideline to score by scoring the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
as a guideline to score by scoring the
eggplant<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.940> salt<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.660> allows<00:01:21.900> all

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
eggplant I can salt it and it allows all

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
eggplant I can salt it and it allows all
the<00:01:22.320> bitterness<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> come<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.180> again<00:01:24.300> it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the bitterness to come out so again it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.310 
the bitterness to come out so again it's
an<00:01:25.050> up-and-down<00:01:25.470> motion<00:01:25.800> no<00:01:26.460> rocking<00:01:27.320> gliding

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
an up-and-down motion no rocking gliding

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
an up-and-down motion no rocking gliding
the<00:01:28.410> knife<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> knuckle<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.369> nakiri

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the knife on the knuckle so the nakiri

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.590 
the knife on the knuckle so the nakiri
with<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> double<00:01:36.750> scallop<00:01:37.140> both<00:01:37.380> sides<00:01:38.600> squared

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
with a double scallop both sides squared

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.160 
with a double scallop both sides squared
off<00:01:39.780> tip<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.850> can't<00:01:42.060> poke<00:01:42.420> yourself<00:01:42.539> but

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
off tip so you can't poke yourself but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.450 
off tip so you can't poke yourself but
again<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> specifically<00:01:44.039> vegetable

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
again this is specifically vegetable

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760 
again this is specifically vegetable
knife<00:01:44.580> now<00:01:44.789> there's<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> eggplant<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.680> I'll

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
knife now there's the eggplant what I'll

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:56.410 
knife now there's the eggplant what I'll
do<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.899> clean<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.020> an<00:01:49.170> onion<00:01:49.410> here

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.030 

so<00:01:57.420> again<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.170> down<00:01:58.290> motion<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so again an up and down motion not a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.130 
so again an up and down motion not a
rocking<00:01:59.520> motion<00:02:02.479> glides<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.750> through

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
rocking motion glides right through

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.780 
rocking motion glides right through
because<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.950> double<00:02:05.220> beveled<00:02:05.580> edge

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
because of the double beveled edge

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.330 
because of the double beveled edge
you'll<00:02:06.420> notice<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.099> julienned<00:02:08.099> onions

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you'll notice that the julienned onions

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
you'll notice that the julienned onions
fall<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.759> off<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.720> I'm<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:13.020> looking<00:02:13.170> at
