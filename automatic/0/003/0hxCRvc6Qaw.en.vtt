 they gave an overview of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.060
 important current hotel issues 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.850
 that the next elections here in hill 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
 of ivory the situation in burkina faso and

 the epidemic the ebola fever that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 continue to mourn several countries 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.769
 from west africa to the end of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.309
 the interview the two heads of state have 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.309
 each makes a statement in a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.510
 first time we will listen to that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.510
 of the French president 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.239
 after I received one with you will tell you 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 the president alassane ouattara 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.230
 I have the impression that we were not 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 leave since we were there is 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.100
 a few days to dakar together to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.239
 the occasion of the summit of la francophonie 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.859
 myself I was in Abidjan 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.040
 a few weeks ago a few months to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.170
 pain and I was very well received 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.350
 with a delegation of chiefs 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.299
 extremely rich business in 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.970
 the economic development of the coast 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.600
 of ivory is impressive and it does 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 must not be tampered with either by 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.350
 sanitary flails that are close but 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.630
 that are contained neither by the situation 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.780
 safe in the area and this is the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.820
 sense of our relationship to make sure 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 that the Ivory Coast which is an example 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.009
 for many countries including in the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.500
 ability with which the Ivory Coast 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.170
 assured his transition that we 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.990
 can keep this stability and in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 same time in respect of the rights 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 that's what happens 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.780
 we also want the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.560
 elections to be held in 2015 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.460
 presidential election may be in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.310
 transparency and with pluralism 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.680
 and therefore plurality of candidates but that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.810
 does not depend only on the president he 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.250
 agrees that the forces who want to 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.040
 present at the polls can I make 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.190
 freely and want to do it 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.100
 we are also concerned that the reform 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.430
 of the Ivorian army can accelerate 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.709
 to ensure a lasting peace 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.330
 we talked about several topics 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.130
 first of this development of the coast 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.440
 of ivory that we want to encourage that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.150
 we want to support and that's all 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.380
 meaning of the deleveraging trad 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.530
 development that is pretty exemplary 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.330
 also what is called c2d and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.030
 we are agreed on the amount 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.600
 of a second slice more than one 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.600
 billion euros and which will focus on 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.430
 priority areas for the coast 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.590
 Ivory and for France 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 education health urban development and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.000
 transport infrastructure while 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.220
 pursuing cooperation in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.750
 of justice which is also requested by 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.610
 the ivory coast are in a 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.010
 process also of debt cancellation 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.959
 because we want to show that there is 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.549
 to this will 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.110
 whenever we can do 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.910
 conversions in favor of 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.870
 investment 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.370
 we also have a lot 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.959
 of companies that are present in hill 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.299
 ivory a lot of companies 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.530
 French and I really ask that 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.850
 she can be aware that this is 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.410
 serve the growth of the Ivory Coast 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.360
 and serve the growth of France 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.340
 what am I saying to that shot we have 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.250
 moreover, several contracts that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.060
 been made since my last visit 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.130
 and I am very happy we have 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.760
 evoked in the africa region of 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.040
 west with two main topics 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.019
 the first is the ebola rib virus 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.920
 of ivory is not touched the coast 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:57.440
 of ivory is helped in the plan 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.000
 precisely prevention by France and 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.140
 are aware that it's first in 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.989
 the affected countries we have to be 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.349
 the most effective it was the sense of my 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.670
 visit to dinner and what we have 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.980
 could have done with europe to ensure the 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.440
 presence of carers ensure the form 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.500
 these caregivers and allow in guinea 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.169
 forest to treat evil where it 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.120
 alas declared is to do in 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.880
 so that on the borders we 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.010
 can be vision without enclosing the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.040
 very important country that development 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:37.080
 countries that are affected by ebola 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:42.350
 can continue we have also evoked 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:46.650
 the burkina faso since it happened 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:50.910
 the events that we know and we 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.310
 must have the same requirement wages 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.550
 the one we had brought to the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.370
 president as not and the requirement and the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.919
 respect for the constitutional order 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.470
 the requirement and the date of the elections and 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.770
 to have there too a process of 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.560
 transition but France is at the side 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.020
 burkina faso since those 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.960
 conditions there are respected and those who 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:21.270
 have risen up was also aware 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.760
 good burkina faso that it was necessary to have the 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.410
 respect for constitutional rules 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.770
 that was why he had 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.129
 raised on 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.690
 finally the climate if I can say we 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:38.300
 have the will africa and europe coast 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.190
 of ivory and france to make this appointment 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.990
 you know that in a few months there will be 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.629
 will have an important meeting in africa 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.639
 of water to participate in this process 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:50.810
 to make the climate conference a success 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:53.360
 and I insist on this point the green fund 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.599
 who is going to be created who is created already who 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.669
 is open to contributions France 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.680
 has cleared a billion dollars there 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.990
 above this green fund will not be clearly 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.430
 useful for lake and I know the coast 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.789
 of ivory will present many projects 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.830
 to be fully associated with the 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.870
 energy transition is the reason 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.419
 for which our relations with the coast 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.830
 of ivory are multiple and each time 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.830
 useful for our two countries
