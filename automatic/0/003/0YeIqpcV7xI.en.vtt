00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
time and here's the really great part

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.439 
time and here's the really great part
your<00:00:55.110> system<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.829> made<00:00:56.070> from<00:00:56.250> 30%<00:00:57.120> recycled

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
your system is made from 30% recycled

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
your system is made from 30% recycled
steel<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.620> won't<00:00:58.829> rot<00:00:59.219> support<00:00:59.850> mold<00:01:00.120> growth

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
steel it won't rot support mold growth

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.720 
steel it won't rot support mold growth
or<00:01:00.719> insects<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.410> non<00:01:01.800> combustible<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
or insects is non combustible so it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.500 
or insects is non combustible so it
won't<00:01:02.940> burn<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:04.260> course<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.460> steel<00:01:05.880> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
won't burn and of course it's steel so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.240 
won't burn and of course it's steel so
it's<00:01:06.659> plenty<00:01:07.020> strong<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.650> stable<00:01:07.890> enough<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it's plenty strong and stable enough to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
it's plenty strong and stable enough to
tackle<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> job<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:10.140> lighter

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
tackle the job and it's actually lighter

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
tackle the job and it's actually lighter
more<00:01:11.010> compact<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.000> easier<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> move<00:01:12.750> around

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
more compact and easier to move around

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.710 
more compact and easier to move around
than<00:01:13.260> wood<00:01:13.790> there's<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> great<00:01:15.450> little

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
than wood there's also a great little

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.560 
than wood there's also a great little
benefit<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.229> hope<00:01:16.380> you'll<00:01:16.560> never<00:01:16.799> use

but<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.530> using<00:01:31.710> quick<00:01:32.100> sticks<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
but if you're using quick sticks your

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
but if you're using quick sticks your
repair<00:01:33.390> could<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.750> simple<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.320> cutting<00:01:34.650> out

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
repair could be as simple as cutting out

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
repair could be as simple as cutting out
the<00:01:34.979> damaged<00:01:35.310> drywall<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.119> replacing<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the damaged drywall and replacing it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.800

quick sticks is hot dipped galvanized

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
quick sticks is hot dipped galvanized
steel<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.950> water<00:01:41.189> isn't<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
steel so a little water isn't going to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.800 
steel so a little water isn't going to
hurt<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.570> bit

so<00:01:43.770> how<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> quick<00:01:44.460> sticks<00:01:44.759> drywall

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so how does the quick sticks drywall

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.690 
so how does the quick sticks drywall
framing<00:01:45.750> system<00:01:45.899> work
