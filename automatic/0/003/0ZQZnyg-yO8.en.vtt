00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
has been ported to the Sprint no three

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.800 
has been ported to the Sprint no three
it's<00:00:26.310> exact<00:00:26.760> same<00:00:26.970> ROM<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.420> I'll<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.689> go

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's exact same ROM so I'll just go

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.720 
it's exact same ROM so I'll just go
ahead<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.080> use<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.619> one<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.369> only<00:00:29.580> thing

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
ahead and use this one the only thing

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.889 
ahead and use this one the only thing
this<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.480> does<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> s5<00:00:32.070> camera

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
this one does not have is the s5 camera

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.360 
this one does not have is the s5 camera
because<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> developer<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.829> took<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
because the developer actually took it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610 
because the developer actually took it
out<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.450> having<00:00:37.140> some<00:00:37.410> bug's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
out because it was having some bug's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
out because it was having some bug's
there<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> note<00:00:38.730> 3<00:00:38.969> camera<00:00:39.300> but

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there so you get the note 3 camera but

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.470 
there so you get the note 3 camera but
otherwise<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.680> turns<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.280> Note<00:00:41.489> 3<00:00:41.790> into<00:00:42.329> an

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
otherwise it turns your Note 3 into an

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020 
otherwise it turns your Note 3 into an
s5<00:00:43.020> um<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.920> let's<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.399> ahead<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:44.969> some

with<00:02:58.080> four<00:02:58.290> instances<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.940> know

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
with four instances this is you know

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.160 
with four instances this is you know
useful<00:03:00.420> because<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.140> like
