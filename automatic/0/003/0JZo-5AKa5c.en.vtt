00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.270 
so today we're hopefully in the finish
of<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.730> project<00:02:15.530> what<00:02:16.530> we're<00:02:16.680> doing<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.160> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
of this project what we're doing as you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.070 
of this project what we're doing as you
can<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> big<00:02:17.910> water<00:02:18.240> tank<00:02:18.330> variable

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
can see is a big water tank variable

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.350 
can see is a big water tank variable
water<00:02:19.290> tank<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.740> think<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.980> either<00:02:20.330> 1719

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
water tank I think it's either 1719

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.430 
water tank I think it's either 1719
can't<00:02:21.660> remember<00:02:21.840> off<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.960> top<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.170> my<00:02:22.260> head

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
can't remember off the top of my head

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.120 
can't remember off the top of my head
and<00:02:22.680> we're<00:02:23.310> filling<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:25.530> ramp<00:02:25.860> pump

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
and we're filling this with a ramp pump

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.390 
and we're filling this with a ramp pump
a<00:02:26.840> ramp<00:02:27.840> pump<00:02:28.080> requires<00:02:28.260> no<00:02:28.710> electricity<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
a ramp pump requires no electricity it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.920 
a ramp pump requires no electricity it
is<00:02:29.520> totally<00:02:29.910> EMP<00:02:30.390> proof

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
is totally EMP proof

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
is totally EMP proof
so<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.350> prepper<00:02:31.650> wanted<00:02:32.370> an<00:02:32.490> EMP<00:02:33.030> proof

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
so this prepper wanted an EMP proof

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
so this prepper wanted an EMP proof

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
doing right now the RAM pump is running

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.970 
doing right now the RAM pump is running
and<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.160> filling<00:02:53.520> this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.420 

a<00:02:59.069> half<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.819> gallon<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.480> minute<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.250> like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
a half a gallon a minute so this is like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.660 
a half a gallon a minute so this is like
a<00:03:02.989> turtle<00:03:03.989> not<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.860> hair<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.220> slow<00:03:05.489> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
a turtle not like the hair it's slow and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.729 
a turtle not like the hair it's slow and
steady<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.060> 24<00:03:06.540> hours<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> day<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.650> gonna

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
steady but 24 hours a day this is gonna

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.920 
steady but 24 hours a day this is gonna
pump<00:03:07.980> about<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.190> half<00:03:08.370> again<00:03:08.700> into<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.599> tank

pump about a half again into this tank
when<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.620> gets<00:03:10.830> full<00:03:11.090> there's<00:03:12.090> two<00:03:12.330> lines

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
when it gets full there's two lines

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.990 
when it gets full there's two lines
there's<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.049> supply<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:13.620> return<00:03:13.849> it<00:03:14.849> will

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
there's just supply and return it will

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.350 
there's just supply and return it will
then<00:03:15.239> return<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.290> back<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.160> will<00:03:17.280> keep<00:03:17.489> nice

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
then return it back so it will keep nice

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.550 
then return it back so it will keep nice
and<00:03:18.720> fresh<00:03:19.110> circulated<00:03:19.769> water<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.280> tank

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.289 
this system should pump be able to pump
about<00:03:24.390> 500<00:03:24.900> gallons<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.470> day<00:03:25.890> up<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.060> thing

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
about 500 gallons a day up to this thing

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.890 
about 500 gallons a day up to this thing
so<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.900> few<00:03:28.049> days<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.440> will<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.620> full<00:03:28.860> as<00:03:29.900> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
so in a few days it will be full as you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.449 
so in a few days it will be full as you
can<00:03:31.079> see<00:03:31.290> there's<00:03:31.530> also<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.829> two-inch<00:03:32.250> line

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
can see there's also a two-inch line

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.830 
can see there's also a two-inch line
that<00:03:32.579> two-inch<00:03:32.879> line<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.180> for<00:03:33.329> firefighting

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
that two-inch line is for firefighting

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.860 
that two-inch line is for firefighting
he'll<00:03:34.739> have<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> nice<00:03:35.940> pump<00:03:36.269> at<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.480> bottom

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
he'll have a nice pump at the bottom

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.530 
he'll have a nice pump at the bottom
plus<00:03:37.349> you'll<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.859> capacity<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.819> fight<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
plus you'll have the capacity to fight a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.660 
plus you'll have the capacity to fight a
fire<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.140> gravity<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:41.010> are<00:03:41.129> high<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.370> on

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
fire with the gravity we are high up on

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.309 
fire with the gravity we are high up on
this<00:03:41.819> hill<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.780> gonna<00:03:42.930> show<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.109> too

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319

much<00:03:43.349> of<00:03:43.620> his<00:03:43.709> house<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.190> there's<00:03:44.370> houses

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
much of his house but there's houses

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.539

it's<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.049> ways<00:03:46.230> down<00:03:46.590> there<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.040> he's<00:03:47.220> gonna<00:03:47.340> get

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
it's a ways down there so he's gonna get

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.289 
it's a ways down there so he's gonna get
about<00:03:47.640> 35<00:03:48.239> psi<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:48.840> sure<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.180> is

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
about 35 psi for sure and and that is

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.240 
about 35 psi for sure and and that is
more<00:03:51.900> than<00:03:52.049> adequate<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.500> take<00:03:52.890> care<00:03:53.099> of<00:03:53.160> his
