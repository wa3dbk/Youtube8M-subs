00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.330
 welcome everyone matteo migliorini 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.010
 and in this video tutorial I will show you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.150
 an example of using the plugin a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.910
 frost for 3ds max in this case we have 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.520
 a rial flow simulation generated 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.220
 with the hybrid system I remind you that to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.680
 following link you can view the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.519
 tutorial to export the simulation 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 compatible for krakatoa parts 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.190
 we didn't create the mash because 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.020
 the intent is to create it with frost 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 once in 3ds max we can 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.850
 load the coles parts and render 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.850
 concretized to the best we believe 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.540
 at the same time we can use frost per 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.540
 generate the mash with the prt lauder 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.560
 once the type of mesh has been chosen 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.410
 available in the appropriate rollout 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.790
 we can generate it to the fullest 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.170
 of course the calculation is very fast 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 and in real time 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.080
 this system is much faster and 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.030
 fluid compared to the classic basic system 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.030
 3ds max blog match 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.290
 also as you can see allows 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.240
 also to be able to take advantage of a hundred for 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.360
 one hundred all the different cores inside 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.730
 of our eu station what the other 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.850
 system does not allow besides being able 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 vary our at any time 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.920
 mesh with being a speed 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.390
 every time we change something 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.360
 inside the mesh at the bottom a 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.490
 left we will see the time 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.740
 of realization and therefore the possibility 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.720
 to understand where we are at 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.720
 a very precise percentage
