of the company that caused the spill the
chemical<00:03:24.280> has<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:25.150> very<00:03:25.540> very<00:03:25.810> low<00:03:27.000> toxicity<00:03:28.000> so

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
chemical has a very very low toxicity so

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.860 
chemical has a very very low toxicity so
so<00:03:29.260> if<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.830> look<00:03:30.040> at<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.690> technical<00:03:31.690> bit
