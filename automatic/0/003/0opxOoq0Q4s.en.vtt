student deserves to feel bad plus the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
student deserves to feel bad plus the
statistics<00:00:55.590> show<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.829> there'll<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
statistics show that there'll be a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
statistics show that there'll be a
massive<00:00:57.480> number<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> jobs<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.320> computing<00:00:58.680> in

massive number of jobs in computing in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
massive number of jobs in computing in
the<00:00:58.890> future<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.699> than<00:00:59.820> any<00:01:00.000> other<00:01:00.149> stem

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the future more than any other stem

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.900 
the future more than any other stem
field<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:02.039> teaching<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.670> skills

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
field so by teaching them these skills

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
field so by teaching them these skills
now<00:01:03.120> they'll<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:03.809> more<00:01:04.049> likely<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> go

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
now they'll be much more likely to go

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
now they'll be much more likely to go
into<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.799> field<00:01:05.090> we<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.540> them

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
into that field we want to get them

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
into that field we want to get them
pumped<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.260> prepared<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.360> why<00:01:09.510> we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
pumped and prepared so that's why we

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
pumped and prepared so that's why we
have<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.960> entire<00:01:10.229> topic<00:01:10.560> dedicated<00:01:11.189> computer

independent study like let's say you
have<00:02:01.290> advanced<00:02:01.619> students<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.250> want<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
have advanced students that you want to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.340 
have advanced students that you want to
keep<00:02:02.579> engaged<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.270> they've<00:02:03.390> already<00:02:03.570> blazed

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
keep engaged and they've already blazed

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.480 
keep engaged and they've already blazed
through<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> curriculum<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.130> you've<00:02:05.250> given

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
through the curriculum that you've given

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
through the curriculum that you've given
them<00:02:05.610> well<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.299> could<00:02:06.390> assign<00:02:06.689> them<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> learn

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
them well you could assign them to learn

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.859 
them well you could assign them to learn
programming<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.890> an<00:02:08.039> independent<00:02:08.520> project

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
programming as an independent project

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.790 
programming as an independent project
maybe<00:02:09.869> ask<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.379> go<00:02:10.500> through<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
maybe ask them to go through the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.170 
maybe ask them to go through the
programming<00:02:11.280> tutorial<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> particular

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
programming tutorial up to a particular

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.000 
programming tutorial up to a particular
point

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
point

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.320 
point
and<00:02:13.099> have<00:02:13.310> them<00:02:13.430> propose<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> project<00:02:14.060> that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and have them propose a project that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.690 
and have them propose a project that
ties<00:02:14.599> into<00:02:14.840> adults<00:02:15.170> they're<00:02:15.319> learning<00:02:15.700> for

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
ties into adults they're learning for

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.039 
ties into adults they're learning for
example<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.360> students<00:02:17.870> learning

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
example if the students learning

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.020 
example if the students learning
chemistry<00:02:18.260> they<00:02:19.099> could<00:02:19.250> learn<00:02:19.370> programming

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
chemistry they could learn programming

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.910 
chemistry they could learn programming
and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:20.269> write<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> program<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.439> visualize<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and then write a program to visualize a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.899 
and then write a program to visualize a
molecule<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.459> this<00:02:22.730> cool<00:02:22.939> 3d<00:02:23.420> one<00:02:23.659> or<00:02:24.909> if

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
molecule like this cool 3d one or if

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:26.979 
molecule like this cool 3d one or if
they're<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.180> math<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.420> they're<00:02:26.810> learning

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
they're in math and they're learning

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.449 
they're in math and they're learning
trigonometry<00:02:27.799> they<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.129> write<00:02:28.310> these

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
trigonometry they can write these

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.610 
trigonometry they can write these
visualizations<00:02:28.939> to<00:02:29.659> show<00:02:30.260> what<00:02:30.440> they've

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
visualizations to show what they've

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.640 
visualizations to show what they've
learned<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.659> then<00:02:32.659> think<00:02:33.049> about<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.379> they<00:02:33.500> can

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
learned and then think about it they can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.199 
learned and then think about it they can
actually<00:02:33.980> share<00:02:34.250> these<00:02:34.489> with<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.849> wrestler

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
actually share these with the wrestler

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.569 
actually share these with the wrestler
class<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.750> say<00:02:35.900> hey<00:02:36.110> classmates<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.220> look<00:02:37.459> at

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
class and say hey classmates is look at

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.280 
class and say hey classmates is look at
this<00:02:37.670> thing<00:02:37.909> I<00:02:38.060> made<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.420> help<00:02:38.599> us<00:02:38.780> visualize

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
this thing I made to help us visualize

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.140 
this thing I made to help us visualize
what<00:02:39.769> we've<00:02:39.920> learned<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.400> if<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.879> were<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
what we've learned and if I were the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.940 
what we've learned and if I were the
classmates<00:02:41.659> I<00:02:41.870> would<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.439> really<00:02:42.620> impressed

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
classmates I would be really impressed

classmates I would be really impressed
and<00:02:43.280> if<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.459> was<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> student<00:02:43.939> i'd<00:02:44.180> be<00:02:44.420> really

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
and if I was a student i'd be really

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.559 
and if I was a student i'd be really
really<00:02:44.959> proud<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.459> also<00:02:46.609> use<00:02:46.760> com<00:02:47.060> cs4

different understanding of a topic and

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.250 
different understanding of a topic and
you<00:03:02.060> can<00:03:02.209> even<00:03:02.299> take<00:03:02.569> her<00:03:02.690> with<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.870> few<00:03:03.139> of<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
you can even take her with a few of the

you can even take her with a few of the
variables<00:03:04.569> for<00:03:05.569> example<00:03:05.629> if<00:03:06.280> students<00:03:07.280> are

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
variables for example if students are

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.220 
variables for example if students are
learning<00:03:07.400> about<00:03:07.730> pendulums<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.049> point

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
learning about pendulums you can point

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.500 
learning about pendulums you can point
them<00:03:09.409> to<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.709> pendulum<00:03:10.099> example<00:03:10.639> where<00:03:11.329> you

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
them to this pendulum example where you

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.319 
them to this pendulum example where you
can<00:03:11.690> actually<00:03:11.950> play<00:03:12.950> with<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.280> angle<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.269> the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
can actually play with the angle and the

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.360 
can actually play with the angle and the
length<00:03:14.629> you've<00:03:15.530> seen<00:03:15.739> I've<00:03:15.980> already<00:03:16.129> actually

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
length you've seen I've already actually

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.680 
length you've seen I've already actually
tinkered<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.849> some<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.209> variables<00:03:17.480> you

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
tinkered with some of the variables you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.000 
tinkered with some of the variables you
could<00:03:17.810> change<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.169> gravity<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.709> be<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:18.980> a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
could change the gravity to be on a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.789 
could change the gravity to be on a
completely<00:03:19.459> different<00:03:19.609> planet<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.799> you

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
completely different planet that you

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.439 
completely different planet that you
know<00:03:21.919> most<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.669> us<00:03:22.819> don't<00:03:22.970> get<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.269> pleasure

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
know most of us don't get the pleasure

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.720 
know most of us don't get the pleasure
of<00:03:23.599> getting<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.959> visit<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:25.190> can<00:03:25.340> change<00:03:25.579> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
of getting to visit you can change the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.089 
of getting to visit you can change the
mass<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.299> can<00:03:26.419> change<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> radius<00:03:27.199> so<00:03:27.980> you

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
mass you can change the radius so you

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.210 
mass you can change the radius so you
can<00:03:28.340> tinker<00:03:28.669> both<00:03:28.879> in<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:30.019> UI<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.709> in<00:03:31.099> the

can tinker both in the UI and in the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.680 
can tinker both in the UI and in the
variables<00:03:31.639> over<00:03:31.730> here<00:03:32.090> for<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.359> lot<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.599> these

simulation programs and look I've

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.470 
simulation programs and look I've
managed<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.379> do<00:03:36.590> what<00:03:36.859> every<00:03:37.489> school<00:03:38.449> child

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
managed to do what every school child

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.330 
managed to do what every school child
wants<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:39.169> do<00:03:39.319> when<00:03:39.560> you're<00:03:39.680> on<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.829> swing<00:03:40.129> set

wants to do when you're on the swing set
be<00:03:41.180> able<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.780> swing<00:03:42.049> all<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.379> way<00:03:43.250> over<00:03:44.000> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
holy grail for another example if you're

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.430 
holy grail for another example if you're
learning<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.299> solar<00:03:47.540> system<00:03:48.019> like<00:03:48.230> an

learning the solar system like an

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.259 
learning the solar system like an
astronomy<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.579> could<00:03:49.760> use<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:50.030> solar

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
astronomy you could use this solar

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.030 
astronomy you could use this solar
system<00:03:50.359> simulation<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:51.440> see<00:03:51.620> how<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.919> is<00:03:52.010> that

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
system simulation to see how it is that

system simulation to see how it is that
the<00:03:52.430> planets<00:03:53.120> move<00:03:53.299> around<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.660> Sun<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.139> then

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
the planets move around the Sun and then

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.319 
the planets move around the Sun and then
you<00:03:54.769> can<00:03:54.919> just<00:03:55.129> easily<00:03:55.459> tweak<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.970> variables

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
you can just easily tweak the variables

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.849 
you can just easily tweak the variables
on<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:56.510> side<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.019> say<00:03:57.349> you<00:03:57.590> know<00:03:57.709> what

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
on the side and say you know what

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.559 
on the side and say you know what
happens<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.519> earth<00:03:58.669> was<00:03:58.879> really<00:03:59.329> really

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
happens if the earth was really really

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.390 
happens if the earth was really really
fast<00:03:59.840> go<00:04:00.049> zumi<00:04:00.349> zumi<00:04:00.379> zumi<00:04:00.680> around<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.220> Sun

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
fast go zumi zumi zumi around the Sun

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.539 
fast go zumi zumi zumi around the Sun
and<00:04:02.470> what<00:04:03.470> happens<00:04:03.859> if<00:04:04.129> the<00:04:04.250> earth<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.699> huge<00:04:06.549> so

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
and what happens if the earth is huge so

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.069 
and what happens if the earth is huge so
you<00:04:07.639> can<00:04:07.790> give<00:04:07.940> students<00:04:08.239> as<00:04:08.359> program<00:04:08.810> and

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
you can give students as program and

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.439 
you can give students as program and
have<00:04:09.229> them<00:04:09.349> teamer<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.709> variables<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.449> get

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
have them teamer the variables and get

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.599 
have them teamer the variables and get
them<00:04:11.569> actively<00:04:11.989> engaged<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:13.099> with

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
them actively engaged in it with

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.309 
them actively engaged in it with
thinking<00:04:13.940> about<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.659> know<00:04:14.780> how<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.019> solar

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
thinking about you know how the solar

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.310 
thinking about you know how the solar
system<00:04:15.709> works<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.419> maybe<00:04:17.419> also<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.989> gets<00:04:18.169> them

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
system works and maybe also it gets them

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.229 
system works and maybe also it gets them
thinking<00:04:18.349> about<00:04:18.680> programming<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.669> maybe

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
thinking about programming and maybe

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.670 
thinking about programming and maybe
they<00:04:20.449> start<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.840> explore<00:04:21.109> programming

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
they start to explore programming

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.589 
they start to explore programming
independently<00:04:22.280> which<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.639> something<00:04:23.510> that

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
independently which is something that

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.659 
independently which is something that
would<00:04:23.780> be<00:04:23.870> great<00:04:24.200> for<00:04:24.860> schools<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.520> don't

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
would be great for schools that don't

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.860 
would be great for schools that don't
actually<00:04:25.849> get<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.210> teach<00:04:26.479> it

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
actually get to teach it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.260 
actually get to teach it
the<00:04:26.930> core<00:04:27.139> topic<00:04:27.970> eventually<00:04:28.970> in<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.210> future

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
the core topic eventually in the future

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.689 
the core topic eventually in the future
what<00:04:29.660> we're<00:04:29.810> hoping<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:31.430> know<00:04:31.550> all

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
what we're hoping is that you know all

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.460 
what we're hoping is that you know all
kids<00:04:32.030> will<00:04:32.300> grow<00:04:32.479> up<00:04:32.570> learning<00:04:33.199> how<00:04:33.410> to

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
kids will grow up learning how to

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.050 
kids will grow up learning how to
program<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.220> every<00:04:34.520> time<00:04:34.699> they<00:04:34.880> learn

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
program and every time they learn

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.270 
program and every time they learn
something<00:04:35.510> in<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:36.470> know<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.620> math<00:04:36.860> or<00:04:37.040> science

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
something in you know a math or science

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.790 
something in you know a math or science
or<00:04:37.639> even<00:04:38.000> an<00:04:38.090> art<00:04:38.270> topic<00:04:38.690> they'll<00:04:39.410> think<00:04:39.590> oh

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
or even an art topic they'll think oh

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800 
or even an art topic they'll think oh
that's<00:04:40.010> really<00:04:40.280> cool<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.910> wonder<00:04:41.630> if<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.750> can

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
that's really cool I wonder if I can

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.360 
that's really cool I wonder if I can
make<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.169> program<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.740> help<00:04:42.800> me<00:04:42.979> understand

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
make this program to help me understand

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.250 
make this program to help me understand
it<00:04:43.490> even<00:04:43.669> deeper<00:04:43.970> right<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:44.870> think<00:04:44.900> that's

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
it even deeper right and I think that's

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.659 
it even deeper right and I think that's
the<00:04:45.380> power<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.590> programming<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.370> that<00:04:46.520> can

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
the power of programming is that can

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.520 
the power of programming is that can
actually<00:04:46.970> connect<00:04:47.419> all<00:04:47.870> these<00:04:48.229> pieces

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
actually connect all these pieces

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.820 
actually connect all these pieces
together<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.430> help<00:04:50.300> us<00:04:50.479> explore<00:04:50.960> them<00:04:51.199> in<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
together and help us explore them in a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.189 
together and help us explore them in a
more<00:04:52.010> interactive<00:04:52.370> way<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.810> those<00:04:54.020> are<00:04:54.169> some

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
more interactive way so those are some

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.870 
more interactive way so those are some
ways<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.590> we've<00:04:55.070> thought<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.310> about<00:04:55.669> how<00:04:55.820> you

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
ways that we've thought of about how you

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.300 
ways that we've thought of about how you
can<00:04:56.150> use<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.449> Khan<00:04:56.630> CS<00:04:56.990> curriculum<00:04:57.440> but<00:04:58.010> don't

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
can use the Khan CS curriculum but don't
