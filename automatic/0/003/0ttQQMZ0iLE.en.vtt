00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.540
 craft course help motorists here 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.120
 such a small little reviewer 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.970
 Obzorchik called us people wheel with 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.290
 tractor challenger hole in it 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.390
 new wheels bought 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.000
 holes with a diameter of 20 millimeters but 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.600
 something suited me urgently need perry 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.380
 drill on 24 and a half stud 24 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 were 20 is it possible to do this to us 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.509
 brought and here we already had in place 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 awful it is already ready all the tales 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.320
 will be removed and all at 24 and a half 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.420
 we didn't know how to do it just 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.000
 bring all here people brought it to us 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.460
 wheel naturally install it nowhere 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 not possible it was wheel diameter y 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.380
 him meter eighty how is it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.340
 can be done here already depends on 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.240
 human personality approach is all 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.950
 This is solved in an unusual way there 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.430
 There are no standard solutions in these 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.430
 of questions 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.729
 work urgent tractor worth sowing need 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.799
 on this time to think 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.560
 practically no how best of 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.340
 of this position 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.200
 then still is first drilled 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.130
 drill little turn 100 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.959
 drilled a hole at 22 by 22 to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.780
 under then what do we need to drill 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.690
 one four and a half 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.810
 hand drill is problematic understandable 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.989
 there is a drill and which are on magnets but 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.420
 and not have it and have time to think, too, there is no 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.590
 so here was the solution 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.519
 simply equipping the tool allows 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.849
 took a simple scan for 25 like that 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.310
 manual how to say passed been on 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.390
 24 and a half back and laval and spout 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.790
 done 22 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.670
 first drill this nozzle 22 not 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 wears made 22 and made and made her 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:58.400
 here are the feathers all this sharpened 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.099
 how would make the cutter now spout is 22 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:07.310
 center it holes and mill 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.639
 as if because we need to save 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.329
 stretching if we do not keep stretching it 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.510
 just just the holes do not match with 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.690
 knock there on the hub is not going anywhere 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.530
 so stretching is very important but all 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.780
 it turned out well we have half I 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.799
 could 3 spent all year on this job 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.799
 but the work is still done from him
