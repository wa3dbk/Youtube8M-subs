00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.500
 [Music] 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.299
 aulas chicos welcome to the heights 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 of Barcelona where the sun is at the rendezvous 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.090
 you're lucky for the 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.669
 presentation of this new dodge day 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.930
 so suv crossover minivan this is true 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.490
 that the positioning of this vehicle is 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.900
 a little atypical but know that the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.000
 journey is a full-fledged minivan 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.619
 with its 7 places is positioned at the same 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.300
 title that a big space where a ford 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.470
 s-max so let's see what gives this 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.600
 new vehicle throughout the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:40.940
 day 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:42.859
 [Music] 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.930
 the strength of this day obviously his 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.579
 physical since the monospace resumes 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.980
 the beauty guns of the brand to 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.420
 know the grille is believed with the comic to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.239
 the interior symbol of the brand 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.969
 the big front shield really present 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.379
 angular and very very domed and also the 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.089
 flanks widens so it's really a 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.010
 vehicle that can be said of the mouth 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.350
 pretty exotic and what really does 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.810
 its strength that distinguishes it from a minivan 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:14.000
 banal like a like a big space where 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:15.710
 van hees max for example the first 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.720
 impression aboard this journey it's 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.159
 that's how would I say a little cheap 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.869
 as impression ie at the level 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.100
 plastics and finishing is 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.850
 also other remark than at the level of the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.229
 Central console 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.550
 we know very well equipped 1 we have a 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.619
 air conditioning 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.690
 to separate means that we also have a 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.280
 high-end model but the driver 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.509
 can get lost a little with all 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.500
 the buttons on the console 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.479
 central to manage the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.460
 air conditioning front / rear the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.049
 radio navigation finally that's it 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.250
 really a lot of pimples and the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.990
 driver can really get lost 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 otherwise we really have a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.379
 good driving position a good 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.970
 visibility is quite comfortable so much 

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:48.770
 at the shoulders than from that I the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.869
 guard at the roof then the dodge journey 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.069
 proposed in two versions a version 5 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.539
 seats and a 7 seater version 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.039
 this one is a 7 seater version on 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.810
 So our test model what has been 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.640
 particularly appreciated those habitability 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.649
 who still in the mid-range 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.810
 quite generous but good without being too 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.410
 exceptional but it's especially his 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.420
 modularity 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.250
 because in a flash 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.429
 really easily banquette people 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 at the 6th relieves via jacks and hop it 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.730
 there's just really a little pushed the rayo 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.500
 it was very easy to rush for 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.610
 mothers and access to board 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 also especially for big templates 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.310
 what we liked is that it is 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.840
 these facilities 1 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.180
 we really knew worse in the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 category and so we sit on the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.700
 really both folding seats back 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.800
 so it's comfortable we will not do 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.410
 really a big trip with and that's 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.360
 quite suitable 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.650
 so for the load volume it's 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.360
 really very simple at the level of 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.800
 modularity and that we have something 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.770
 bulky we have two small strips 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.520
 attract and hop the folders will fold and 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.520
 we have a flat floor 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.179
 [Music] 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.720
 if his behavior the journey is 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.190
 really more typical comfort with 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.510
 rather flexible suspensions that are 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.170
 really not suited to driving 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.310
 athletic 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.900
 faye has only one offer of 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.970
 motorizations that is proposed this is the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.600
 of liszt and rd so that's actually it's 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.550
 the former tdi volkswagen so injectors 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.840
 pump so with all the flaws that 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.350
 go with it's it's got it's 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.120
 slugger and a lot bourian is also 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.610
 quite greedy since the sweat we have 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 recorded on a mixed average between 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.490
 highway and highway an average of 11 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.210
 liters so what is already really not 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.790
 bad for the diesel 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.040
 that's it and if not overall behavior passed 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.290
 to these boats well the roll is rather 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.730
 well compensated is really what we 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.950
 we did not like it at all 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.360
 new 6-speed auto box that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.070
 patina 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.260
 between each report what really 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.240
 struggling to get started with times of 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.240
 passing very long and 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.650
 the operator do not have very well and 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.650
 that he has some qualities of the engine 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.660
 so after a whole day spent at 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.340
 flying this new minivan 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.650
 he really leaves me on an impression 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.300
 mixed or even slightly disappointing by 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.010
 compared to competition since so much 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.800
 on the dynamic benefits enough 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.440
 clumsy and on the tariff not really 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640
 competitive it really brings nothing 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.530
 new compared to the competition 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.550
 maybe by his physical then 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.290
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.920
 try and you 're a good day 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.920
 on caradisiac
