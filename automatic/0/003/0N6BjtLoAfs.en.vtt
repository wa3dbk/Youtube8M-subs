00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
HBO or Showtime I have I mean how this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.429 
HBO or Showtime I have I mean how this
comedy<00:01:19.009> central<00:01:19.549> get<00:01:20.179> that<00:01:20.420> stuff<00:01:20.750> on<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.079> just

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
seems like that wouldn't be possible

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.940 
seems like that wouldn't be possible
when<00:01:23.420> how<00:01:23.600> much<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.140> does<00:01:24.319> end<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:24.649> on<00:01:24.860> the
