ghosts it's on the flood level and it's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.030 
ghosts it's on the flood level and it's
quite<00:00:12.599> easy<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:13.049> start<00:00:13.290> off<00:00:13.410> like<00:00:13.590> us<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
quite easy you start off like us and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.670 
quite easy you start off like us and
basically<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.670> start<00:00:14.730> off<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.330> Riley<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
basically you start off as Riley and the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.830 
basically you start off as Riley and the
dog<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> place<00:00:18.330> they'll<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.660> no

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
dog and you just a place they'll be no

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.410 
dog and you just a place they'll be no
this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.260> first<00:00:19.439> co<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.490> nice<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.270> simple

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this is a first co and nice and simple

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.560 
this is a first co and nice and simple
you<00:00:22.350> don't<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:22.980> much<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.369> there's<00:00:24.119> not

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
you don't have to do much so there's not

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.689 
you don't have to do much so there's not
that<00:00:24.630> much<00:00:24.900> tricky<00:00:25.350> ones<00:00:25.560> unless<00:00:25.769> at<00:00:26.099> sea<00:00:26.310> this

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that much tricky ones unless at sea this

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
that much tricky ones unless at sea this
is<00:00:26.849> probably<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> trickiest<00:00:27.779> ones

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
is probably one of the trickiest ones

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.970 
is probably one of the trickiest ones
and<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> basically<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.080> let<00:00:31.260> them<00:00:31.380> go<00:00:31.830> their

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and so basically you let them go their

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.560 
and so basically you let them go their
separate<00:00:32.250> ways<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.850> attack<00:00:33.090> came<00:00:33.120> fast

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
separate ways the attack came fast

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
separate ways the attack came fast
that's<00:00:33.780> nice<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> easy<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:35.190> you're<00:00:35.370> behind

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's nice and easy if you're behind

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
that's nice and easy if you're behind
them<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.540> makes<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.870> sneak<00:00:37.170> attack<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
them I think it makes a sneak attack so

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.040 
them I think it makes a sneak attack so
they<00:00:38.250> don't<00:00:38.460> hear<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> screaming<00:00:39.600> show<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
they don't hear have a screaming show in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.150 
they don't hear have a screaming show in
the<00:00:40.140> blood<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.379> fraught<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.430> yeah<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:43.160> crazy

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the blood and fraught and yeah I'm crazy

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.190 
the blood and fraught and yeah I'm crazy

and simple you just press lb when it
goes<00:01:25.380> red<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.750> difficult<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.560> it's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
what yeah you have to start again or

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.230 
what yeah you have to start again or
that<00:01:34.920> checkpoint<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.549> least<00:01:35.700> em<00:01:37.939> next<00:01:38.939> guys

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that checkpoint at least em next guys

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.109 
that checkpoint at least em next guys
here<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.920> rally<00:01:41.159> again<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> last

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
here you go rally again this is the last

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
here you go rally again this is the last
time<00:01:42.329> until<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.750> five<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.290> during

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
time until you get five of them during

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.609 
time until you get five of them during
the<00:01:44.250> sequence<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:45.540> basically<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> die

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the sequence and basically if you die

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
the sequence and basically if you die
you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.979> restart<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> checkpoint<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.880> it's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you can restart the checkpoint and it's
