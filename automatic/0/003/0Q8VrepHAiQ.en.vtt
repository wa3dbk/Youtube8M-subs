00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.380
 bodies this tournament anyway if you 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 watch this video I spend a big 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.729
 dedications of the people following me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.799
 for a moment that I say that I 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.770
 was discussing at the time with him on his pc 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.450
 sun store % ps on the live psn has 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 saved these youngsters destroy brief but y 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.259
 understood and who had not advised me 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.570
 that he had shown me his candies there that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.829
 I did not know and so 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 I was very intrigued I thought 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.439
 why not have them in cowardice and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.460
 make it a boxing taste way the most 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.290
 long look at this packaging 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.610
 Frankly nickel is very small but 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.770
 scenic and then that's really 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.759
 well damn it that kind of thing that I 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.140
 will keep even if the sweets are 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.640
 quickly I'll keep them it's like the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.039
 hatsune miku candy from the box that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.510
 the wages keep them 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.849
 and so that's so we'll start it's going 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.359
 balls very quickly so against I 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.390
 do not know how it opens up I did not 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:29.470
 no idea 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.430
 I will see like that no no not even 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.470
 so here I confess I do not know 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:40.760
 not at all how does it suffer perhaps 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 like that of them and so that opens up as 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.639
 that then it does not open up here are 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.159
 were fine like that for example but 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.709
 I know what it's not you pass by here 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.329
 like that if it's done like that hop and 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.159
 we put in the mouth 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.930
 so that's a lot I open day opens 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:02.030
 again sorry if I scared 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.220
 in this stuff there goes opening the box 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.569
 it was really not planned but we 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.500
 this is what it looks like by conceding 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:14.440
 buyers and his little the no bags 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.040
 do not wait 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.930
 there's only that wait a little 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.699
 look look look here you see 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.159
 that between the the end of my wood and there 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.720
 there is a gap between that and that's it 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.760
 a space in May where he follows ben at the same 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.540
 time necessarily regard and salient this 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.560
 hollow good it's not very serious but 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.370
 it's clear that by seeing that at the beginning we 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.769
 believed that it is believed that there is 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.780
 a lot but by the way, there's only that 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.919
 comes from that scrambles it here but 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.269
 it does not matter the packaging is 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:51.380
 really very well let them 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:04:01.130
 quiet 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:17.600
 they are with the teeth here that's it 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:20.030
 I have a cover to see her in there but 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.660
 the less they all have the same shape the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.090
 pacman the south of camembert koupela and the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.040
 cam with camembert cut with a fine 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.280
 camembert whoever is cut off this makes 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.230
 So here is a pacman by cons 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.480
 that I do not understand is that one 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.590
 said during iliad is sometimes seeing 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.410
 the ja there are true strawberry iris that 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.760
 cherry and strawberries but but is that 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.960

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.830

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.150

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.150

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.170

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.610
 m 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.660
