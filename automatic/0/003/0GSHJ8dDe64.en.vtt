 wason and eduardo rodrÃ­guez who this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.200
 who asked I want to talk to you about why 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.650
 reason we talk in dreams 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.650
 you are 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.070
 well let's see 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 studies on this tell us that in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 some moment of our life 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.540
 all of us have spoken to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.510
 minus one word while we were 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.120
 sleeping the truth is that something is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 curious everything we are capable of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 do while we are mired in this 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.920
 dream state or in our dreams 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.969
 brain is still incredibly 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.159
 active organizing the information 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.619
 selecting and deleting data we dream 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.869
 it is even possible that even yourself 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.190
 In addition to talking in dreams, you are also 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.280
 incredible sleepwalker true 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.540
 Sigmund Freud was undoubtedly one of the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.909
 pioneers in delving into these seas of what 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.850
 unconscious as the power of the oneiric 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 and all that is behind the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.819
 hair of our eyelids asleep today 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.969
 we do not want to look for the meaning of the 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:35.759
 dreams and understand that mysterious tasks 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:39.060
 realizes our brain while it is 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.819
 resting on this occasion we are going to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.880
 look for an answer to something so simple 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.899
 as disturbing because there are people who 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.899
 they talk in dreams 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.480
 the somnia which is a complex name for 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.420
 a complex treatment the somni nokia 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.690
 it is a type of parasomnia ie a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.240
 type of behavioral disorder that happens 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.530
 when we are sleeping but you do not 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.600
 alarms by the word resistor 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.120
 it's nothing serious or dangerous or has 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.120
 psychological consequences none of that 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.360
 it's a phenomenon that happens while 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.360
 we are in the rem phase 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 or fast eye movement is a state 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.830
 of the dream also called sleep 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.350
 paradoxical that magical moment in which 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.500
 It simply opens the door of the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.350
 dreams 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.020
 in that moment in which our 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.330
 neurons work in a very intense way 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.140
 almost at the same level as when we are 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.350
 awake the daydreams reach 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.870
 accelerate its functionality we dream that 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.040
 we run, let's continue, we fly, we dream that 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.129
 We caress that we fly and that we talk 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.819
 if we pronounce words while 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.909
 we are united is precisely because in 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.489
 this phase of the rem state is broken 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:08.030
 momentarily that sleep balance 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.819
 that is, the normal thing is that our 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.250
 Muscles mouths and vocal cords are 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.459
 inactive the inactive body but 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.129
 for a very brief moment it breaks 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.390
 that control and those words of our 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:25.870
 dreams are pronounced time letter 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.510
 it is a disconnection of the oneiric where 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.950
 the motor system is back with me 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.500
 Aragon and more can still exist 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.599
 second option by which to leave 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.329
 escape part of our speech 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.939
 while we are sleeping there is another 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.890
 sleep time called transient that 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.709
 is out of the rem state of the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.890
 spoke before is a state in which 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.959
 we are awake there where they are activated 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.909
 suddenly some waking states that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.909
 they allow us again to speak out loud 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.200
 studying the data these data say 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.510
 that at least 50% of the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.609
 population speaks in dreams but in fact 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.650
 almost all of us do it in a few moments 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.999
 determined when we are working 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.659
 period of tranquility and stress 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:17.160
 moment when the pressure of our 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.139
 life is also reflected in our 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.030
 dreams accelerating more attention 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.680
 our neurons and causing effects 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.479
 like this 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.880
 we talk we wake up 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.710
 hastily and we grind the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.740
 teeth and we may even have 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.110
 episodes of sleepwalking why 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.539
 we say during those instants has 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.150
 some sense of statehood the truth 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.639
 is that they are not just words 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.870
 isolated that emerge loudly in 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.009
 amid cries lyric course of the dream 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.139
 expressions that may be 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.870
 emotionally significant to 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.940
 us at that moment but totally 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.430
 incomprehensible and incomprehensible to the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.620
 person that we have next so 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.020
 Beware of those sudden words that 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.750
 they emerge involuntarily while 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.940
 we sleep not to see what you say if it has 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.159
