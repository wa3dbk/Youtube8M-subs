00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.640
 we start by hydrating the gelatine without 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.700
 taste 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.480
 an envelope with no flavor is equal to 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:25.630
 a spoonful is hydrated in a room 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.630
 cup of water that is equal to 4 tablespoons 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.780
 if the glucose that we are going to use in 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.019
 this case is very liquid we must 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.960
 reinforce the unflavored gelatin a little 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:51.199
 either by removing a spoonful of water 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.809
 or increasing it a little bit more 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.899
 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.460
 these four tablespoons of water is left 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.460
 fall in the form of rain 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.850
 and in the best way because it 's where the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.850
 Absorbs completely and does not form lumps 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.910
 I'm going to add one more teaspoon for 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.800
 reinforce because the glucose that I'm 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.370
 using is not enough 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.370
 dense 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.409
 let stand for 5 to 10 minutes 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.140
 when the gelatin is already hydrated 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.930
 already the grain has absorbed all the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.210
 water amount 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.360
 and the grain has been strengthened 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 strengthened at that time we carry it 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.460
 in a bain-marie or microwave 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.479
 fifteen seconds it took to dilute the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.180
 gelatin but we should add two 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.250
 tablespoons of glucose that measured in a 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.610
 oiled spoon so that I do not get 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.610
 stick 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.810
 two tablespoons of glycerin 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.930
 and a tablespoon of vegetable fat 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.820
 if we have it in a bain-marie the heat that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.600
 is getting help to these other 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.270
 ingredients are melting in the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.930
 microwave oven case I must take it 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:02.000
 again 15 seconds more so that it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.000
 can dilute well and mix 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.150
 these 15 additional seconds of heat 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.830
 help it to finish melting well the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.830
 fat and glucose 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.330
 The mixture should not be left to boil. 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.970
 should heat up a lot when we 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.270
 it warms a lot we should lower it a little 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.390
 the temperature or wait for it to cool 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.750
 everything is very good 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.870
 dissolved and mixed so that it does not 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.720
 form lumps from the beginning if 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.300
 the mixture warms up a lot is going to 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.380
 ask for a lot of powdered sugar and that's 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:52.200
 balance to the mass takes away quality 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.200
 it removes elasticity it dries a lot 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.780
 add little by little the powdered sugar 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.470
 and it mixes well between each 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.470
 addiction 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.410
 we should always scrape the walls 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.050
 of the container so that we are not formed 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.080
 crusts to be well mixed 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.080
 all 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.949
 unflavored gelatin is the one that coagulates 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.180
 the mass and glucose is what gives you 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.880
 elasticity 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.919
 Glycerin gives you softness and fat 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.010
 also glycerin in humid climates 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:55.699
 can not be used much makes crying and the 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.699
 cover makes it honeyed and does not dry well 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:07.400
 at this point where he already collects where 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.400
 we can form ball we take it out to the inn 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.560
 and we put it between a sugar crown 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.560
 powdered 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.560
 we greased our hands a little 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.260
 and we started mixing very well with the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.540
 sugar 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.540
 we do it in an enveloping way 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.610
 as incorporating the sugar by 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.610
 part of inside 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.720
 but observe 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:20.060
 how it falls fast 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.060
 hand as it is falling 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.840
 he still lacks sugar 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.170
 I'm going to add a little more sugar to 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.840
 improve consistency but it 's better 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.620
 that is soft so that in the rest 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.140
 a consistency and firmness later to 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.870
 extend if you need a little bit of 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.060
 sugar is added but it is better than not 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.370
 it's so hard when we're 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.370
 preparing and we will let it rest 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.830
 they look like 350 grams of sugar 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.450
 powdered 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.450
 previously sifted 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.890
 if we drop it here by pressing on the 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.550
 hand like a few minutes ago she is not 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:14.320
 bag neither falls as much as the time 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:19.040
 previous to grabbing her she keeps 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.650
 certain firmness but it is soft 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.920
 it must remain because in rest it 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:28.080
 harden a bit 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.080
 we wrap with plastic 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:36.530
 and let it rest preferably 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:40.159
 until the next day to handle it and that 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.889
 be easier to use the cover let's 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:46.159
 to prepared with a spoonful plus one 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.300
 Gelatin teaspoon without flavor turned out 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:53.479
 in a weight 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:58.800
 of 620 grams to make this cover 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:08:01.520
 we add between 300 and 350 grams of 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.520
 powdered sugar
