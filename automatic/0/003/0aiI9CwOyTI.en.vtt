00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
Kara and I want to just establish a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.340 
Kara and I want to just establish a
presence<00:00:05.759> I'm<00:00:06.120> just<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.750> know<00:00:06.779> electrical<00:00:07.230> no

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
presence I'm just you know electrical no

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.140 
presence I'm just you know electrical no
we<00:00:07.529> were<00:00:07.649> messing<00:00:07.799> around<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.059> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
we were messing around and it was a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.470 
we were messing around and it was a
little<00:00:09.240> cranky<00:00:09.510> but<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.830> feel<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.910> didn't

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
little cranky but I feel like I I didn't

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.180 
little cranky but I feel like I I didn't
know<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.809> pays<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.259> expect<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.830> given<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
know what pays to expect just given the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.890 
know what pays to expect just given the
conditions<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.480> let<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.750> body

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
conditions and so I just let my body

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
conditions and so I just let my body
kind<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.289> gravitate<00:00:16.650> towards<00:00:17.039> whatever<00:00:17.490> pace

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
kind of gravitate towards whatever pace

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.060 
kind of gravitate towards whatever pace
that<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.750> laughs<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.470> felt<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:19.949> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that was for laughs and I felt like I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.439 
that was for laughs and I felt like I
found<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.369> good<00:00:20.490> rhythm<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.970> probably<00:00:21.330> more

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
found a good rhythm and probably more

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.420 
found a good rhythm and probably more
like<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> 77s<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.650> most<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> race<00:00:23.070> every

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
like the 77s for most of the race every

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.450 
like the 77s for most of the race every
seven<00:00:23.699> seconds<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.119> laughs<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:25.230> yeah<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> got

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
seven seconds for laughs but yeah I got

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.220 
seven seconds for laughs but yeah I got
out<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.730> established<00:00:27.240> just<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> presence<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
out and established just a presence and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.779 
out and established just a presence and
just<00:00:28.800> let<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.039> knowing<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.460> wanted<00:00:29.609> to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
weeks out for my marathon much faster

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.169 
weeks out for my marathon much faster
than<00:01:22.819> even<00:01:22.939> tonight<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:23.719> I<00:01:24.710> had<00:01:25.459> judo<00:01:25.880> sumo

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
tuck like than me and I actually focused

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.919 
tuck like than me and I actually focused
more<00:01:28.039> on<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.280> speed<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.450> didn't<00:01:29.719> do<00:01:29.810> as

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
more on the speed and I didn't do as

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.359 
more on the speed and I didn't do as
much<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.380> endurance<00:01:30.649> training<00:01:30.860> because<00:01:31.310> I

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
much of the endurance training because I

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.249 
much of the endurance training because I
had<00:01:31.459> already<00:01:31.549> done<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:31.880> all<00:01:32.179> winter<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.689> you

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
had already done that all winter and you

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.230 
had already done that all winter and you
know<00:01:33.350> literally<00:01:34.009> done<00:01:34.280> months<00:01:34.609> of<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:34.909> so

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
know literally done months of that so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.940 
know literally done months of that so
all<00:01:35.509> I<00:01:35.659> did<00:01:35.869> was<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.140> sharpen<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:36.649> for<00:01:36.859> this

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
all I did was just sharpen up for this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.010 
all I did was just sharpen up for this
and<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:38.119> wasn't<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:38.450> fast<00:01:38.630> as<00:01:38.869> those

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
and it wasn't as fast as those

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.679 
and it wasn't as fast as those
conditions<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.859> it<00:01:40.759> was<00:01:40.880> windy<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.299> hot

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
conditions and it was windy and hot

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.729 
conditions and it was windy and hot
which<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:41.929> just<00:01:42.170> like<00:01:42.289> seems<00:01:42.530> like<00:01:42.649> an

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:42.739 
which is just like seems like an

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.059 
which is just like seems like an
oxymoron<00:01:43.009> but<00:01:44.079> so<00:01:45.079> yes<00:01:45.259> if<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.679> conditions

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
oxymoron but so yes if the conditions

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.740 
oxymoron but so yes if the conditions
were<00:01:46.130> an<00:01:46.220> ideal<00:01:46.459> and<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:46.939> had<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.090> make<00:01:47.569> do

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
were an ideal and we just had to make do

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.539 
were an ideal and we just had to make do
it<00:01:47.899> whatever<00:01:48.079> I<00:01:48.259> would<00:01:48.469> but<00:01:48.709> yeah<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.369> wasn't

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
it whatever I would but yeah it wasn't

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.459 
it whatever I would but yeah it wasn't
easy<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:50.060> was<00:01:50.209> a<00:01:50.239> very<00:01:50.719> nice<00:01:50.989> transition

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
easy it was a very nice transition

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.749 
easy it was a very nice transition
between<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.799> marathon<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.219> only<00:01:52.399> took<00:01:52.610> like

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
between the marathon I only took like

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.819 
between the marathon I only took like
three<00:01:52.939> days<00:01:53.119> off<00:01:53.329> my<00:01:53.989> quads<00:01:54.259> were<00:01:54.409> sore<00:01:54.590> about

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
three days off my quads were sore about

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.300 
three days off my quads were sore about
10<00:01:55.819> days<00:01:56.000> but<00:01:56.420> got<00:01:56.659> over<00:01:56.929> that<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.770> then<00:01:57.950> just

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
10 days but got over that and then just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.569 
10 days but got over that and then just
kind<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.179> seamless<00:01:59.509> transition<00:02:00.049> it<00:02:00.979> was<00:02:01.099> 84

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
kind of seamless transition it was 84

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.699 
kind of seamless transition it was 84
that<00:02:01.759> further<00:02:02.000> with<00:02:02.270> 84<00:02:02.959> degrees

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
that further with 84 degrees

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.699 
that further with 84 degrees
yeah<00:02:04.129> I<00:02:04.159> felt<00:02:04.489> it<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:05.030> was<00:02:05.500> one<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.619> those

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
yeah I felt it it was one of those

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.279 
yeah I felt it it was one of those
situations<00:02:07.009> where<00:02:07.579> you<00:02:08.090> know<00:02:08.509> traditionally

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
situations where you know traditionally

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.569 
situations where you know traditionally
I<00:02:09.379> like<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.619> close<00:02:09.799> down<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> end<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.429> race

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
I like to close down the end of the race

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.699 
I like to close down the end of the race
you<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.030> pretty<00:02:11.390> fast<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.019> just<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.440> didn't

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
you know pretty fast and I just I didn't

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.069 
you know pretty fast and I just I didn't
want<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.489> run<00:02:13.670> any<00:02:13.910> faster<00:02:14.120> than<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.569> was<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.930> was

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
want to run any faster than I was I was

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.539 
want to run any faster than I was I was
one<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.350> those<00:02:15.440> survival<00:02:16.010> races<00:02:16.310> where<00:02:16.459> I'm

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
one of those survival races where I'm

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.979 
one of those survival races where I'm
just<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.819> can<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.030> please<00:02:17.389> get<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:17.690> over

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
with as soon as possible so it was just

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.370 
with as soon as possible so it was just
is<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.700> comfortable<00:02:20.910> from<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.330> beginning

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.020 

beside<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.410> had<00:02:25.560> two<00:02:25.680> worlds<00:02:25.950> at<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:26.940> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
beside I had two worlds at all if I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.780 
beside I had two worlds at all if I
thought<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.630> had<00:02:27.690> two<00:02:27.900> worlds<00:02:28.200> no<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:29.640> too

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
thought I had two worlds no not not too

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.340 
thought I had two worlds no not not too
much<00:02:29.940> other<00:02:30.240> than<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.690> wanted<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.050> be<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
much other than I wanted to be on the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.840 
much other than I wanted to be on the
team<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.010> haven't<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.640> thought<00:02:32.790> about

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
team but I haven't really thought about

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.780 
team but I haven't really thought about
the<00:02:33.270> race<00:02:33.420> per<00:02:33.870> se<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.370> competition<00:02:35.370> really

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the race per se or competition really

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.050 
the race per se or competition really
yet<00:02:36.270> now<00:02:36.840> my<00:02:37.319> mind<00:02:37.530> thinking<00:02:37.830> about<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.130> what's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
yet now my mind thinking about it what's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.729 
yet now my mind thinking about it what's
your<00:02:39.300> what's<00:02:39.780> your<00:02:39.840> racing<00:02:40.260> schedule<00:02:40.470> going

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
your what's your racing schedule going

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.080 
your what's your racing schedule going
to<00:02:40.800> go<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> mean<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.640> mean<00:02:44.819> used<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
to go I don't know I mean I mean used to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.370 
to go I don't know I mean I mean used to
ground<00:02:45.330> run<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.660> 5k<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.140> Sunday<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
ground run the 5k on Sunday and the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.350 
ground run the 5k on Sunday and the
enemy<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.459> ready<00:02:50.580> for<00:02:50.730> Moscow<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.270> then

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
enemy just get ready for Moscow and then

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.630 
enemy just get ready for Moscow and then
maybe<00:02:51.510> run<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> little<00:02:51.959> bit<00:02:52.110> after<00:02:52.290> Moscow<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.370> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
maybe run a little bit after Moscow so I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.190 
maybe run a little bit after Moscow so I
think<00:02:53.760> I'll<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.180> run<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.600> maybe<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:55.080> more

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
think I'll just run to maybe one more

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.350 
think I'll just run to maybe one more
competitive<00:02:55.739> race<00:02:59.030> what<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> think<00:03:00.269> it

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
competitive race what do you think it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:10.759 
competitive race what do you think it
takes<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:08.900> mean<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.350> depends<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.709> the

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
takes to mean so it just depends on the

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.780 
takes to mean so it just depends on the
race<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.550> it's<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.720> know<00:03:13.489> more<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.670> an

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
race if it's a you know more of an

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.360 
race if it's a you know more of an
impure<00:03:15.450> endurance<00:03:16.050> race<00:03:16.319> where<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:17.220> a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
impure endurance race where it's just a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.190 
impure endurance race where it's just a
good<00:03:17.670> solid<00:03:17.880> effort<00:03:18.269> from<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.510> beginning<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
good solid effort from the beginning I

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.840 
good solid effort from the beginning I
think<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.800> probably<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> better<00:03:20.519> shot<00:03:20.640> of

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
think I probably have a better shot of

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.880 
think I probably have a better shot of
doing<00:03:21.239> well<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.600> if<00:03:22.110> it's<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.319> kickers<00:03:22.620> race

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
doing well there if it's a kickers race

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.060 
doing well there if it's a kickers race
I<00:03:23.489> won't<00:03:23.760> fare<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.269> well<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:25.200> kick<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:25.739> not

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
I won't fare as well I can kick but not

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.949 
I won't fare as well I can kick but not
maybe<00:03:26.519> as<00:03:26.670> world-class<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.570> then<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.750> come

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
maybe as world-class and then I come

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.110 
maybe as world-class and then I come
wash<00:03:28.170> himself<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.640> know<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.760> don't<00:03:30.030> really

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
wash himself you know I don't really

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.660 
wash himself you know I don't really
know<00:03:30.329> all<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.510> my<00:03:30.750> coach<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.340> homework

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
know all that my coach do the homework

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.580 
know all that my coach do the homework
and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
and
needs<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.769> done<00:03:34.799> but<00:03:35.219> I'm<00:03:35.730> feeling<00:03:35.849> pretty

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
needs to be done but I'm feeling pretty

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.789 
needs to be done but I'm feeling pretty
fit<00:03:36.359> what<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.900> finished<00:03:37.109> it's<00:03:37.499> coming<00:03:37.889> around

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.099 

I'm<00:03:43.799> not<00:03:43.980> afraid<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.370> lead<00:03:44.730> at<00:03:44.969> all<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> said<00:03:45.810> one

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
I'm not afraid to lead at all I said one

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.929 
I'm not afraid to lead at all I said one
more<00:03:46.139> my<00:03:46.769> strengths<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.670> I'm<00:03:47.790> not

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
more my strengths I think I'm not

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.209 
more my strengths I think I'm not
intimidated<00:03:48.180> by<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.709> but<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.829> know<00:03:49.950> when<00:03:50.099> the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
intimidated by it but you know when the

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.170
