00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
how to do this because some someone

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.979 
how to do this because some someone
asked<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.680> glued<00:00:56.370> them<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.780> know

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
asked me how we glued them on and I know

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.970 
asked me how we glued them on and I know
I've<00:00:59.030> before<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.960> studied<00:01:01.260> guns<00:01:01.649> knew

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I've before I really studied guns knew

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.210 
I've before I really studied guns knew
about<00:01:02.520> guns<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> whatnot<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.420> used<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.220> glue

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
about guns and whatnot I used to glue

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.710 
about guns and whatnot I used to glue
them<00:01:05.369> backwards<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.270> thought<00:01:06.479> that's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
them backwards because I thought that's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.030 
them backwards because I thought that's
the<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.320> went<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.680> I've<00:01:07.770> done<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the way they went so I've done that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.420 
the way they went so I've done that
numerous<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.880> times<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.830> if<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> guys<00:01:11.100> have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
numerous of times so if you guys have

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.859 
numerous of times so if you guys have
ever<00:01:11.580> done<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.210> feel<00:01:12.420> bad<00:01:12.659> because

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
ever done that don't feel bad because

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.350 
ever done that don't feel bad because
I've<00:01:13.170> done<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.920> bunch<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> times<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I've done that a bunch of times and I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
I've done that a bunch of times and I
back<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.810> you've<00:01:15.960> been<00:01:16.049> broken<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.710> little

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
back so you've been broken these little

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.690 
back so you've been broken these little
holographic<00:01:17.670> sights<00:01:17.880> which<00:01:18.060> suck<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> will

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
holographic sights which suck so I will

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.060 
holographic sights which suck so I will
go<00:01:20.820> ahead<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.299> teach<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> guys<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.920> do

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
go ahead and teach you guys how to do

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
go ahead and teach you guys how to do
that<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.759> doing<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.450> 8k

something with the a kay so there are
some<00:01:41.520> aks<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.540> their<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.649> rel<00:01:44.009> system

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
some aks that have their like rel system

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
some aks that have their like rel system
right<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.180> where<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.509> aimer<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.380> right

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
there but most of the times they're

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
there but most of the times they're
gonna<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.939> them<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.619> depending

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
I'm gonna go with the kind of old way
the<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.990> been<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.740> with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the way they would have been like with

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.670 
the way they would have been like with
the<00:02:01.979> older<00:02:02.250> aks<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> I'm<00:02:03.869> gonna<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the older aks so I'm gonna put that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.459 
the older aks so I'm gonna put that
right<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.930> usually<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> older

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
right there so usually with the older

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.320 
right there so usually with the older
aks<00:02:07.920> there's<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.429> entire<00:02:08.910> little

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
aks there's like this entire little

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.800 
aks there's like this entire little
theme<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:09.989> covers<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.830> entire<00:02:11.310> top

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
theme that just covers this entire top

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.610 
theme that just covers this entire top
that<00:02:12.110> has<00:02:12.800> rails<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.459> whatnot<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.300> so

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that has rails and whatnot on it so

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.720 
that has rails and whatnot on it so
that's<00:02:15.620> what<00:02:15.800> I'll<00:02:15.920> be<00:02:15.980> doing<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.580> my

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
that's what I'll be doing here is my

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.839 
that's what I'll be doing here is my
little<00:02:16.940> holographic<00:02:17.630> sight<00:02:17.870> or<00:02:18.500> EOTech<00:02:19.010> so

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
little holographic sight or EOTech so

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.790 
little holographic sight or EOTech so
first<00:02:20.360> off<00:02:20.569> what<00:02:20.750> I'm<00:02:20.900> gonna<00:02:21.080> need<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.560> is

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
first off what I'm gonna need to do is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.460 
first off what I'm gonna need to do is
start<00:02:22.069> by<00:02:22.250> cutting<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.780> little

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
start by cutting this a a little

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.110 
start by cutting this a a little
aimer<00:02:24.830> off<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:25.489> gonna<00:02:25.610> go<00:02:25.790> ahead<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
aimer off so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.509 
aimer off so I'm gonna go ahead and
speed<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.720> up<00:02:26.900> here<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.980> know<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.370> just

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.910 
speed it up here and you know and just
cut<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.120> off<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.599> sand<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.989> and<00:02:30.110> one<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.739> I'll

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
cut that off and sand it and one so I'll

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:50.420 
cut that off and sand it and one so I'll
go<00:02:31.069> ahead<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.370> do<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.580> real<00:02:31.790> quick

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
use for this type of project this is a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.350 
use for this type of project this is a
special<00:03:02.080> type<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.290> super<00:03:02.800> glue<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.130> use<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:04.150> I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
special type of super glue I use this I

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.090 
special type of super glue I use this I
use<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> time<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.739> is<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.920> only

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
use this all the time this is the only

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.630 
use this all the time this is the only
super<00:03:06.520> glue<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.970> use<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.640> Loctite

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
super glue I use this is the Loctite

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.330 
super glue I use this is the Loctite
super<00:03:10.090> glue<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.720> reason<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.140> chose<00:03:11.890> or

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
super glue and the reason I chose or

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.180 
super glue and the reason I chose or
choose<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.940> use<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.720> one<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.230> because<00:03:14.290> it's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
choose to use this one is because it's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.940 
choose to use this one is because it's
gel<00:03:15.580> control<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.330> not<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.470> just<00:03:17.680> regular

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
gel control and not like just regular

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.040 
gel control and not like just regular
super<00:03:18.520> glue<00:03:18.730> it's<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.120> like<00:03:19.239> really<00:03:19.480> watery

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
super glue it's just like really watery

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.170 
super glue it's just like really watery
and<00:03:20.200> will<00:03:20.410> go<00:03:20.560> everywhere<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.489> make<00:03:21.880> just<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and will go everywhere and make just a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.660 
and will go everywhere and make just a
giant<00:03:22.450> mess<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.080> I'll<00:03:23.680> turn<00:03:23.950> your<00:03:24.130> gun<00:03:24.430> all

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
giant mess and I'll turn your gun all

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.190 
giant mess and I'll turn your gun all
white<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.030> they'll<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.570> look<00:03:25.720> really<00:03:25.959> awful

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
white and they'll just look really awful

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.390 
white and they'll just look really awful
so<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:28.180> why<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.360> use<00:03:28.570> gel<00:03:28.870> control<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.100> this

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
so that's why I use gel control so this

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.130 
so that's why I use gel control so this
is<00:03:30.640> kind<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.570> just<00:03:31.600> stays<00:03:31.959> at

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
is kind of just like it just stays at

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.070 
is kind of just like it just stays at
one<00:03:32.350> spot<00:03:32.709> it's<00:03:32.920> kind<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.160> like<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.640> little<00:03:34.600> gel

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
one spot it's kind of like a little gel

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.009 
one spot it's kind of like a little gel
so<00:03:35.769> that's<00:03:36.160> what<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.370> like<00:03:36.580> using<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.090> for<00:03:37.450> so

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
so that's what I like using this for so

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.630 
so that's what I like using this for so
I'm<00:03:38.260> gonna<00:03:38.380> go<00:03:38.560> ahead<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:39.100> do<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.519> I'm

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
I'm gonna go ahead and do that and I'm

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.150 
I'm gonna go ahead and do that and I'm
gonna<00:03:39.730> use<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.940> toothpick<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.680> know<00:03:42.750> to

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
gonna use a toothpick to you know to

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.240 
gonna use a toothpick to you know to
apply<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.930> super<00:03:46.930> glue<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.950> I'm<00:03:48.010> gonna<00:03:48.130> go

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
apply the super glue so I'm gonna go

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.500 
apply the super glue so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.489> get<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.150> pour<00:03:49.360> my

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
ahead and get that and just pour my

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.960 
ahead and get that and just pour my
super<00:03:49.870> glue<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.050> show<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.410> guys<00:03:50.680> how<00:03:50.980> this

Gorgo<00:05:03.759> good<00:05:04.030> with<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.449> gun<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.620> think

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
Gorgo good with this gun and I think

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.350 
Gorgo good with this gun and I think

that would look really nice with it so
that<00:05:08.020> is<00:05:08.199> what<00:05:08.379> I<00:05:08.409> have<00:05:08.710> here<00:05:09.039> I<00:05:09.220> think<00:05:09.460> it

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
that is what I have here I think it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.580

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
could see probably that little

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.719 
could see probably that little
holographic<00:05:18.729> has<00:05:18.879> the<00:05:19.150> buttons<00:05:19.569> you<00:05:20.729> could

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
holographic has the buttons you could

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.149 
holographic has the buttons you could
use<00:05:21.909> those<00:05:22.090> buttons<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.780> change<00:05:23.020> your<00:05:23.440> your

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
use those buttons to change your your

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.309 
use those buttons to change your your
optic<00:05:24.699> I<00:05:24.909> think<00:05:25.210> it's<00:05:25.389> like<00:05:25.569> the<00:05:25.750> little<00:05:25.990> red

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
optic I think it's like the little red

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:26.909 
optic I think it's like the little red
dot

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
dot

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.709 
dot
I'm<00:05:27.340> sure<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:27.699> could<00:05:27.849> change<00:05:28.030> them<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.419> green

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
I'm sure you could change them to green

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.700 
I'm sure you could change them to green
and<00:05:29.020> red<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.919> believe<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.539> hope<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.199> guys<00:05:32.319> did

ridiculously<00:06:07.539> long<00:06:08.050> and<00:06:08.639> I<00:06:09.639> guess<00:06:10.120> by

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
ridiculously long and I guess by

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.249 
ridiculously long and I guess by
shortening<00:06:10.750> it<00:06:11.110> down<00:06:11.469> a<00:06:11.500> lot<00:06:12.180> would<00:06:13.180> work<00:06:13.419> but

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
shortening it down a lot would work but

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.950 
shortening it down a lot would work but
that's<00:06:14.830> one<00:06:15.219> mag<00:06:15.520> I<00:06:15.550> don't<00:06:16.060> know<00:06:16.210> how<00:06:16.360> to<00:06:16.419> apply

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
that's one mag I don't know how to apply

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.350 
that's one mag I don't know how to apply
so<00:06:17.409> I<00:06:18.159> thought<00:06:18.580> I<00:06:18.610> would<00:06:18.789> let<00:06:18.879> you<00:06:19.000> guys<00:06:19.150> know
