00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
these cars are quite interesting because

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590 
these cars are quite interesting because
as<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.680> said<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.549> first<00:01:41.759> modern

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
as I said it is the first modern

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.010 
as I said it is the first modern
automobile<00:01:43.439> due<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.310> different<00:01:44.939> issues<00:01:45.600> like

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020

up<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.740> 40<00:01:53.159> holds<00:01:53.490> paws<00:01:54.079> at<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.289> time<00:01:55.500> which

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
up to 40 holds paws at the time which

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.870 
up to 40 holds paws at the time which
was<00:01:55.860> terribly<00:01:57.020> much<00:01:58.070> compared<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.729> other

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.139 
was terribly much compared to the other
automobiles<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> market<00:02:01.729> due<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
automobiles on the market due to the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.289 
automobiles on the market due to the

lower center of gravity the car was

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.090 
lower center of gravity the car was
performing<00:02:06.960> much<00:02:07.200> much<00:02:07.469> better<00:02:07.680> when
