a jack of spades times and check out
close<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:48.840> represent<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.840> US<00:00:51.840> government

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
close and to represent the US government

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.180 
I think I will choose the Aces because
the<00:00:58.290> ace<00:00:59.360> upon<00:01:00.360> is<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.720> four<00:01:00.960> aces<00:01:01.200> but<00:01:01.770> also

have to find a way to get to him but
it's<00:01:26.840> not<00:01:27.020> easy<00:01:27.260> because<00:01:27.940> right<00:01:28.940> now<00:01:29.150> he's<00:01:29.750> in

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930

out the four kings because the Russians
also<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.720> secret<00:01:39.200> intelligence<00:01:39.770> called

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
also have a secret intelligence called

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.020 
also have a secret intelligence called
KGB<00:01:41.720> that's<00:01:42.320> why<00:01:42.650> I<00:01:43.330> did<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.990> full<00:01:45.259> case<00:01:47.979> okay

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
KGB that's why I did the full case okay

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.690 
KGB that's why I did the full case okay
now<00:01:50.030> he's<00:01:50.420> on<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.630> protection<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.700> four

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700

now he's on a protection of the four
kings<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.979> symbolize<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:56.680> will<00:01:57.680> take

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
kings and to symbolize that I will take

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.999 
kings and to symbolize that I will take
the<00:01:58.940> three<00:01:59.390> checks<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:01.119> sandwich<00:02:02.119> them<00:02:02.420> in

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
the three checks and sandwich them in

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:11.979 
the three checks and sandwich them in
between<00:02:04.009> each<00:02:04.550> King<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:10.360> close<00:02:11.360> diamonds

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
between each King like so close diamonds

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.400 
between each King like so close diamonds
and<00:02:12.170> space<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.590> between<00:02:12.760> each<00:02:13.760> Jake<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.019> king

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
and space in between each Jake is a king

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.479 
and space in between each Jake is a king
so<00:02:16.040> he<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.340> well<00:02:16.610> protected<00:02:16.850> by<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.720> Russians

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
so he is well protected by the Russians

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.430 
so he is well protected by the Russians
but<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.790> protecting<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.110> further<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:22.459> not<00:02:22.790> in

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
but to protecting you further is not in
