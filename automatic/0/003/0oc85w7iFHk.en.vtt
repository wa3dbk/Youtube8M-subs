00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
but they're pretty bumi so if you're

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
but they're pretty bumi so if you're

with these the high is kind of recessed

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
with these the high is kind of recessed
it<00:00:53.550> seems<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> trend<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.629> gaming

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
headphones Astros have that problem the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
headphones Astros have that problem the
turtle<00:00:58.680> beaches<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.190> kinds<00:00:59.520> problems

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
turtle beaches have all kinds problems

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
turtle beaches have all kinds problems
but<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.930> highs<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.710> slightly<00:01:01.980> recessed

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
but the highs are just slightly recessed

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.709 
but the highs are just slightly recessed
on<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.570> disappointing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
on these which is a little disappointing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
on these which is a little disappointing
but<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

but I think for a lot of people you
won't<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.390> disappointed<00:01:07.020> especially<00:01:07.920> if

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
won't be disappointed especially if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
won't be disappointed especially if
you're<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> high-end<00:01:09.479> headphones

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.480 
base impact is kind of the big deal on
these<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> does<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.490> literally

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
these so what it does is it literally

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.539 
these so what it does is it literally
will<00:01:59.790> vibrate<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.540> headphones<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:02.340> they

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
will vibrate the headphones like they

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.940 
will vibrate the headphones like they
were<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> extreme<00:02:04.590> but

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
were just like that not that extreme but

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.789 
were just like that not that extreme but
you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.030> actually<00:02:06.630> vibrate<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
you know they will actually vibrate and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.010 
you know they will actually vibrate and
there's<00:02:08.039> different<00:02:08.399> modes<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:09.149> gaming

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
there's different modes there's gaming

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.510 
there's different modes there's gaming

played a lot of Uncharted with these if
you<00:02:21.580> put<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:21.910> shooter<00:02:22.510> literally<00:02:23.290> every

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
you put it on shooter literally every

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.980 
you put it on shooter literally every
time<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.010> pull<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> triggers<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:28.270> look<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.660> can

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
time you pull the triggers it look I can

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.540 
time you pull the triggers it look I can
play<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.350> about<00:02:29.440> 30<00:02:29.800> minutes<00:02:30.040> before<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.430> get

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
play for about 30 minutes before I get

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.670 
play for about 30 minutes before I get
really<00:02:30.820> tired<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.360> shooter<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.200> if<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.410> put<00:02:32.560> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
really tired on shooter so if you put it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.380 
really tired on shooter so if you put it
on<00:02:32.770> game<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.820> more<00:02:34.030> subtle

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
on game it's a much more subtle

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210 
on game it's a much more subtle
vibration<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.410> actually<00:02:35.950> sounds<00:02:36.190> pretty

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
vibration and actually sounds pretty

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.070 
vibration and actually sounds pretty
good<00:02:36.490> on<00:02:36.640> game<00:02:36.910> with<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> vibration<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.930> just

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
good on game with the vibration is just

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.550 
good on game with the vibration is just
a<00:02:38.170> little<00:02:38.440> little<00:02:39.370> rumbles<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.560> actually

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
a little little rumbles and actually

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.770 
a little little rumbles and actually

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
