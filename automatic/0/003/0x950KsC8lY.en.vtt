Studios Chad you know just a lot of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.750 
Studios Chad you know just a lot of
stuff<00:00:45.180> i<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.829> everybody<00:00:46.950> says<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
stuff i think a what everybody says is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.779 
stuff i think a what everybody says is
true<00:00:47.940> competition<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.280> market

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
true competition is good for the market

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
true competition is good for the market
they<00:00:51.239> already<00:00:51.510> gave<00:00:51.750> their<00:00:51.960> props<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
they already gave their props to to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
they already gave their props to to
cancel<00:00:53.100> yeah<00:00:53.309> basically<00:00:53.579> they've<00:00:53.969> beaten<00:00:54.210> us

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
cancel yeah basically they've beaten us

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.740 
cancel yeah basically they've beaten us
to<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.020> honest<00:00:55.320> last<00:00:55.469> year<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.760> thinking

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to be honest last year I was thinking

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.360 
to be honest last year I was thinking
that<00:00:57.780> NBA<00:00:58.140> Live<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.620> gone<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.190> good<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that NBA Live was gone for good I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
that NBA Live was gone for good I
thought<00:00:59.670> 2k<00:01:00.149> delivered<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> knockout<00:01:00.930> punch

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
thought 2k delivered the knockout punch

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
thought 2k delivered the knockout punch
and<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.609> right<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.690> now

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and I think as right as of right now

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
and I think as right as of right now
it's<00:01:04.470> probably<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.159> standing<00:01:05.670> eight

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's probably about a standing eight

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
it's probably about a standing eight
count<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
count so I think this is going to be a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
count so I think this is going to be a
pivotal<00:01:07.500> year<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> one-year

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
pivotal year I think that a one-year

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
pivotal year I think that a one-year
development<00:01:09.810> cycle<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.560> hard<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.100> pull

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
development cycle is really hard to pull

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
development cycle is really hard to pull
off<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> sports<00:01:12.479> game<00:01:12.750> especially<00:01:13.080> when

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
off for a sports game especially when

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.929 
off for a sports game especially when
people<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.860> demanding<00:01:14.100> new<00:01:14.400> updates<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
people are demanding new updates and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
people are demanding new updates and
everything<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.869> easy<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
everything it's not easy for the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.260 
everything it's not easy for the
developers<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.580> guy's<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.030> gonna

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
developers to do this guy's I'm gonna

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
developers to do this guy's I'm gonna
repeat<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.930> emphasis<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.159> easy

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
repeat that for emphasis it's not easy

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
repeat that for emphasis it's not easy
to<00:01:21.180> develop<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.780> basketball<00:01:22.590> game<00:01:22.799> every<00:01:23.130> year

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
to develop a basketball game every year

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.190 
to develop a basketball game every year
and<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:24.060> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> where<00:01:24.570> they're<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and that's kind of where they're at I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.660 
and that's kind of where they're at I
think<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.070> needed<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> take

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
think that they really needed to take

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
think that they really needed to take
that<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.630> did<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:28.020> off<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that time off that they did take off the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
that time off that they did take off the
game<00:01:28.860> does<00:01:29.100> look<00:01:29.310> better<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.729> game<00:01:29.909> does<00:01:30.150> look

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
game does look better the game does look

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.730 
game does look better the game does look
promising<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.990> am<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.590> excited

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
promising I am a little bit excited

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.640 
promising I am a little bit excited
about<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.640> am<00:01:33.119> more<00:01:33.360> excited<00:01:33.509> though<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
about it I am more excited though for a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
about it I am more excited though for a

was so there's a lot of stuff that looks

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.550 
was so there's a lot of stuff that looks
promising<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:49.480> again<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:49.990> haven't<00:02:50.260> seen<00:02:50.380> any

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
promising but again we haven't seen any

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.950 
promising but again we haven't seen any
gameplay<00:02:50.800> footage<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.880> will<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.450> behind

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
gameplay footage and it will be behind

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.890 
gameplay footage and it will be behind
in<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.650> way<00:02:53.830> because<00:02:54.070> 2k<00:02:54.730> will<00:02:55.060> release<00:02:55.390> October

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
in a way because 2k will release October

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.810 
in a way because 2k will release October
first<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.380> live<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.190> releasing<00:02:57.610> with<00:02:57.730> the
