00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
mine I'm just borrowing some parts like

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.439 
mine I'm just borrowing some parts like
shocks<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> drive<00:00:52.710> shafts<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
shocks and drive shafts and

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
shocks and drive shafts and
differentials<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.320> plastic<00:00:55.710> parts<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
differentials but the plastic parts I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
differentials but the plastic parts I
mean<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.180> white<00:00:57.420> stuff<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.020> see

mean all this white stuff you can see
it's<00:00:58.320> rapid<00:00:58.620> prototypes<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.430> my<00:01:00.120> own<00:01:00.239> design

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it's rapid prototypes it's my own design

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.860 
it's rapid prototypes it's my own design
so<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.550> can<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:02.699> officially<00:01:03.090> call<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.840> own

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
forward right how long how long has it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.160 
forward right how long how long has it
been<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:08.040> work<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.280> progress<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.939> last<00:01:09.900> year<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
been a work in progress but last year I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
been a work in progress but last year I
ran<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> car<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.920> too<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.430> had<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> design

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
ran a car here too I had the design

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450 
ran a car here too I had the design
already<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> didn't<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> parts<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
already but I didn't have the parts so I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
already but I didn't have the parts so I
basically<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.030> ran<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> kyosho<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.380> own

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
basically just ran a kyosho with my own

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.499 
basically just ran a kyosho with my own
chassis<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.220> other<00:01:17.369> parts<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> try

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
chassis and some other parts just to try

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.990 
chassis and some other parts just to try
the<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.350> layout<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> chassis<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the you know layout of the chassis to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.980 
the you know layout of the chassis to
see<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> works<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.490> all<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.150> last<00:01:24.450> year<00:01:24.659> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
see it works and all all of last year I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
see it works and all all of last year I
was<00:01:25.110> tweaking<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> design<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.340> finally

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
was tweaking the design and then finally

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.670 
was tweaking the design and then finally
at<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> end<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> year<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.290> produced

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
at the end of the year I just produced

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.890 
at the end of the year I just produced
all<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> parts<00:01:29.250> built<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.700> car<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> came<00:01:30.720> here

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
all the parts built a car and came here

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
all the parts built a car and came here
to<00:01:30.960> try<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.460> first
