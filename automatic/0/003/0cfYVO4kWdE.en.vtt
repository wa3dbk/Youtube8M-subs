00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.540
 two points from the home game against the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.529
 Bergisch HC had the MT their fans 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.270
 as a gift for the third advent 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.930
 promised and the team stopped 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.550
 promise 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.200
 with much joy in playing tempo and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.300
 successful moves led the mtv 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
 some 2600 spectators already have time 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.700
 with 23 to 12 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.989
 the leadership would still have 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.309
 can be more pronounced if not 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.820
 several seven meters have been awarded 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.350
 would 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.239
 but the Bergisch hc did not want to 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.980
 can be demonstrated and thus experienced the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.269
 spectators at half-time two a fast-paced 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.859
 hand example where the victory of the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.629
 However, Melsunger never gets into danger 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:54.489
 And so it is finally 40 to 28 degrees 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.920
 have long been noticed in even in the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.210
 other games that we just 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.449
 have grown together and have run 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.909
 and that was a lot of fun today 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.260
 and then I'll come 40 2 28 that 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.340
 just mentioned law together 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.210
 have now grown the fourth game 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.190
 won in a row 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.630
 do you think that's the reason why now 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.900
 run has it like that 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 that's how everyone grew together 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.130
 player now has more games and shares 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.910
 Of course we will get it too 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.950
 Confidence when you win and that 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.720
 You can already join us halfway through 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.710
 Eleven goals led what are you? 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.250
 for the second half still 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.810
 performed 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.670
 yes we always have many in the 2 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.240
 had problems and also master 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.610
 lost 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.110
 we said everything to boys now 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.510
 given and we do not want to lose 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.610
 to retrieve the second 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.970
 unfortunately only with one did not win 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.860
 in front 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.180
 he has the big difficulties 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.600
 from the seven-meter point 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.380
 why was that good that was all right 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 maybe means 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.560
 no idea 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.290
 So I think we are very good 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.210
 the last ones have come into the game 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.530
 play and have it today 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.479
 just managed after halftime 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.860
 constantly playing and the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.120
 second half did not lose that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.450
 was very important to us and that's it 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.590
 successful 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.940
 nevertheless there were some 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.820
 unfocused in the second 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.780
 half-time yes so with security 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.150
 always fall 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.160
 but we stayed under 30 that is 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.210
 our goal and I think you can do that 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.690
 team in front of the praise together 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.610
 pronounce 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 now it goes in one week 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.130
 gummersbach table neighbor it will be 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.750
 serious game definitely follows today 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.870
 feasible is stronger than the bac and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 plays at home so yes there will be 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.420
 in any case not twelve goals for us 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.420
 go out
