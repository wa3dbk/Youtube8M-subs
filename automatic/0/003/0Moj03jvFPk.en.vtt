00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
this first game it isn't a live

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.400 
this first game it isn't a live

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
will be a live commentary so hopefully I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.029 
will be a live commentary so hopefully I
can<00:00:18.720> win<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.590> make<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
can win this one and make it to the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.800 
can win this one and make it to the
final<00:00:20.400> otherwise<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> next<00:00:21.390> game<00:00:21.510> will<00:00:21.689> be

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
final otherwise the next game will be

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.019 
final otherwise the next game will be
the<00:00:21.840> first<00:00:22.140> round<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.369> Lucas<00:00:23.789> makes

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the first round so just here Lucas makes

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
the first round so just here Lucas makes
it<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.359> nil<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> ninth<00:00:25.170> minute<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it one nil for me in the ninth minute a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.439 
it one nil for me in the ninth minute a
great<00:00:26.189> finish<00:00:26.519> from<00:00:26.699> him<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.330> that's
