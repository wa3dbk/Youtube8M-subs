this bar you may want to do it I find
that<00:00:47.570> with<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.930> chain<00:00:48.199> if<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.250> lift<00:00:49.870> from

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
that with the chain if you lift from

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.210 
that with the chain if you lift from
there<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.710> there<00:00:52.510> anything<00:00:53.510> past<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:54.220> is

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
there to there anything past that is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.460 
there to there anything past that is
kind<00:00:55.610> of<00:00:55.790> there's<00:00:56.059> nothing<00:00:56.360> there<00:00:56.600> because<00:00:57.140> of

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
kind of there's nothing there because of

kind of there's nothing there because of
the<00:00:57.559> end<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.070> chain

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
the end of the chain

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.869 
the end of the chain
so<00:00:59.210> really<00:00:59.449> it's<00:00:59.960> they're<00:01:00.409> just<00:01:00.890> little<00:01:01.550> from
