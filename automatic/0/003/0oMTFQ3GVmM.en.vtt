00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.520
 so here are two detectors always at maximum 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.879
 humm axis 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.089
 so today we will test 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.089
 the difference in power 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.760
 a head 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.760
 waitz cannes 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 of diameter eighteen centimeters and 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.369
 a concentric detection head with a diameter of 20 centimeters 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.050
 the head or ice canes forgive the feet with 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.060
 a handicap for this text two powers 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 so first step 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.430
 let's check that the two most discriminating devices as well 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.830
 so fierce so these famous triptych numerous 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.210
 well protected 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.120
 so we set both devices are signed 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.620
 maximum 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.090
 and discrimination 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 at least so I start with the same father 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 the most beautiful with the head you are able 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 so the ferrous and well discriminated 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.010
 now the opportunity with the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.580
 this brotherhood 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580
 so the shocking announcement is perfectly normal 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.640
 distinguish 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.210
 so next step it includes a non-ferrous target of two centimeters 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.970
 of diameter 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.620
 and we will test the power of one of the two heads in the air in a first 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 time so I start with the head or heitz canes 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.469
 I remind the afp sensitivity set maximum edit script to 0 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.550
 here we go 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 1 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 so we do not reach thirteen centimeters in the air 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290
 you can test the concentric head 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.279
 so same principle we continue 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.450
 the text of which m at first 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.450
 1 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.770
 so next step why not the metal tfc monfils nothing 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.059
 clear 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.659
 but first of all we will sweep the field to check who has not 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.399
 other expensive wires they showed me 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.919
 that could disrupt the test results 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.889
 so to be sure 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.899
 I will place myself in all metals mode wallace is expensive 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.449
 and I have not forgotten the small area of ​​tests to check that there is 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.449
 no mechanical accident 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.669
 so that's nice on the face of the paddock and metallic so we're going 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:03.929
 be able to 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.249
 the hole for the non-ferrous target between 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 these two small pieces 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:17.159
 so we surveyed the target but we shave in detection limit for 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.159
 the head or x4 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.289
 there we are at the limits of detection 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.479
 so we are about two centimeters above the surface of the 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.689
 ground 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.119
 there we are in limit of detection 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.119
 I will now test with concentric head 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.759
 so now we're going to decide bagdad 10 common sense good sense on the same 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.089
 target my dear watson as to their appeal always this civic sense of 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.949
 bombs aximum of discrimination 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.109
 at 0 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.519
 these parties me 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.789
 m 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:05.979
 m 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.979
 but not yet members 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.399
 the standard allowance for detection limits at two centimeters 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.249
 above ground 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:18.569
 so we can conclude 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:23.169
 that despite he even has some laughing facts for a metallic target 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.259
 buried in the sand the xk we celebrate as powerful 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.669
 of concentration 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.180
 I remember with a diameter 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.180
 de facto back the sentry
