kind<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.990> like<00:03:28.140> you'd<00:03:28.470> want<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.680> share<00:03:28.920> this

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
kind of like you'd want to share this

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.010 
kind of like you'd want to share this
with<00:03:29.250> these<00:03:29.640> people<00:03:29.940> anyway<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.840> can't

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
with these people anyway but you can't

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.620 
with these people anyway but you can't
always<00:03:31.140> control<00:03:31.350> what<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:32.340> deems<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.150> popular

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
always control what it deems is popular

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.010 
always control what it deems is popular
so<00:03:34.380> let's<00:03:34.890> go<00:03:35.070> back<00:03:35.250> out<00:03:35.460> to<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.790> settings<00:03:36.240> you

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
so let's go back out to the settings you

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.870 
so let's go back out to the settings you
can<00:03:37.050> change<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.560> push<00:03:37.710> notifications<00:03:38.370> so

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
can change the push notifications so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.070 
can change the push notifications so
which<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.090> good<00:03:39.390> because<00:03:39.660> you're<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.020> be

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
which is good because you're going to be

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.010 
which is good because you're going to be
getting<00:03:40.170> push<00:03:40.590> notifications<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.490> this<00:03:41.640> app

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
getting push notifications with this app

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.190 
getting push notifications with this app
you<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.140> change<00:03:43.380> your<00:03:43.530> profile<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.750> add<00:03:45.750> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
you can change your profile and add to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.510 
you can change your profile and add to
remove<00:03:46.440> email<00:03:46.650> addresses<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.340> phone<00:03:47.370> numbers

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
remove email addresses and phone numbers

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.790 
remove email addresses and phone numbers
you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.570> change<00:03:48.750> your<00:03:48.900> circle<00:03:49.260> settings<00:03:49.590> too

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
you can change your circle settings too

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.380 
you can change your circle settings too
so<00:03:50.010> let's<00:03:50.160> say<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.520> Disney<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:50.850> can<00:03:51.060> change<00:03:51.270> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
so let's say for Disney I can change the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.390 
so let's say for Disney I can change the
name<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.440> want<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.800> populate<00:03:53.370> with

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
name of it if I want it to populate with

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.010 
name of it if I want it to populate with
magic<00:03:53.940> stories<00:03:54.330> if<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.660> want<00:03:54.840> push

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
magic stories if I want push

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.700 
magic stories if I want push
notifications<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:58.140> let's<00:03:58.350> say<00:03:58.500> there's

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
notifications and but let's say there's

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.850 
notifications and but let's say there's
another<00:03:58.860> scenario<00:03:59.220> let's<00:04:00.000> say<00:04:00.300> my<00:04:00.900> grandma

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
another scenario let's say my grandma

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.520 
another scenario let's say my grandma
doesn't<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:03.210> a<00:04:05.510> email<00:04:06.510> address<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.200> doesn't

doesn't have a email address and doesn't

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.280 
doesn't have a email address and doesn't
have<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.800> app<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:12.090> what<00:04:12.240> you<00:04:12.300> can<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.930> add<00:04:13.260> a

of<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.789> feature<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.389> could<00:05:06.750> work<00:05:06.870> with<00:05:07.050> in

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
of a feature that could work with in

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.659 
of a feature that could work with in
something<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.650> Facebook<00:05:08.159> and<00:05:08.250> Google+

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
something like Facebook and Google+

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.510 
something like Facebook and Google+
because<00:05:09.259> not<00:05:10.259> a<00:05:10.289> lot<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.770> people<00:05:11.099> want<00:05:11.460> to

only on their iPhone so it's cool it's a
great<00:05:18.330> concept<00:05:18.690> but<00:05:19.319> we're<00:05:19.889> just<00:05:20.039> not<00:05:20.130> sure

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
great concept but we're just not sure

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.529 
great concept but we're just not sure
this<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.669> kind<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:20.969> thing<00:05:21.060> we'd<00:05:21.300> want<00:05:21.330> to

so now hi cutie from Grandma inside of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.939 
so now hi cutie from Grandma inside of
this<00:05:33.419> thread<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:33.930> I<00:05:33.990> can<00:05:34.139> love<00:05:34.289> it<00:05:34.349> which<00:05:34.800> is

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
this thread so I can love it which is

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.240 
this thread so I can love it which is
also<00:05:35.280> kind<00:05:36.000> of<00:05:36.180> like<00:05:36.389> how<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.530> emoticons<00:05:38.039> work

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
also kind of like how the emoticons work

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.370 
also kind of like how the emoticons work
on<00:05:38.430> paths<00:05:38.759> so<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.900> definitely<00:05:40.050> takes

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
on paths so it definitely takes

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.890 
on paths so it definitely takes
inspiration<00:05:40.650> from<00:05:41.009> that<00:05:41.370> app<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:42.389> on<00:05:42.719> the

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
inspiration from that app so on the

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.200 
inspiration from that app so on the
whole<00:05:43.080> we're<00:05:43.560> just<00:05:43.800> not<00:05:43.949> really<00:05:44.250> sure<00:05:44.520> what

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
whole we're just not really sure what

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.450 
whole we're just not really sure what
every<00:05:45.599> me<00:05:45.719> is<00:05:45.960> it's<00:05:46.650> cool<00:05:46.979> but<00:05:47.190> it<00:05:47.340> just

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
every me is it's cool but it just

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.490 
every me is it's cool but it just
doesn't<00:05:47.669> have<00:05:47.969> a<00:05:48.180> whole<00:05:48.419> lot<00:05:48.449> utility<00:05:49.229> because

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
doesn't have a whole lot utility because

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.219 
doesn't have a whole lot utility because
you<00:05:49.680> don't<00:05:49.800> want<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:49.979> spend<00:05:50.219> that<00:05:50.279> much<00:05:50.520> time

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
you don't want to spend that much time

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.399 
you don't want to spend that much time
inside<00:05:52.819> of<00:05:53.819> the<00:05:54.000> app<00:05:54.150> making<00:05:54.779> decisions<00:05:55.199> about

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
inside of the app making decisions about

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.070 
inside of the app making decisions about
where<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.610> want<00:05:56.819> to<00:05:56.940> send<00:05:57.270> data<00:05:57.509> to<00:05:57.630> so<00:05:58.020> let's

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
where you want to send data to so let's

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.469 
where you want to send data to so let's
say<00:05:58.229> I<00:05:58.289> post<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.650> picture<00:05:58.860> here<00:05:59.219> it's<00:05:59.819> not<00:06:00.029> going

couldn't just send them an email because
really<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.860> is<00:06:17.009> kind<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.340> like<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.849> glorified

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
really this is kind of like a glorified

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.189 
really this is kind of like a glorified
email<00:06:20.009> chain<00:06:20.340> like<00:06:20.610> if<00:06:20.759> you<00:06:20.909> look<00:06:21.120> at<00:06:21.360> the

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
email chain like if you look at the

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.529 
email chain like if you look at the
verge<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.919> have<00:06:23.279> I'm<00:06:23.759> sharing<00:06:24.210> with<00:06:24.240> five

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
verge I have I'm sharing with five

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.779 
verge I have I'm sharing with five
people<00:06:25.080> here<00:06:25.319> none<00:06:26.069> of<00:06:26.099> them<00:06:26.279> have<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.610> app

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
people here none of them have the app

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.850 
people here none of them have the app
and<00:06:27.120> even<00:06:27.449> if<00:06:27.539> they<00:06:27.659> did<00:06:27.719> it<00:06:28.349> wouldn't<00:06:28.560> be<00:06:28.710> that

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
and even if they did it wouldn't be that

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.379 
and even if they did it wouldn't be that
much<00:06:29.009> different<00:06:29.069> than<00:06:29.610> this<00:06:29.789> so<00:06:30.000> it's<00:06:30.150> a<00:06:30.240> nice

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
much different than this so it's a nice

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.390 
much different than this so it's a nice
like<00:06:30.690> flexible<00:06:31.229> space<00:06:31.680> where<00:06:31.979> you<00:06:32.009> can<00:06:32.099> do

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
like flexible space where you can do

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.610 
like flexible space where you can do
this<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:32.880> magic<00:06:33.810> stories<00:06:34.169> can<00:06:34.380> populate

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
this and magic stories can populate

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.560 
this and magic stories can populate
information<00:06:35.460> but<00:06:35.669> besides<00:06:36.000> that<00:06:36.120> it's<00:06:36.419> like

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
information but besides that it's like

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.480 
information but besides that it's like
if<00:06:36.719> you<00:06:36.810> use<00:06:36.960> a<00:06:36.990> nice<00:06:37.320> email<00:06:37.649> app<00:06:37.860> like<00:06:38.099> sparrow

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
if you use a nice email app like sparrow

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.490 
if you use a nice email app like sparrow
your<00:06:39.180> email<00:06:39.509> thread<00:06:39.839> is

and it's going to look good and so

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.470 
and it's going to look good and so
that's<00:06:47.400> that's<00:06:47.760> kind<00:06:48.000> of<00:06:48.030> a<00:06:48.120> question<00:06:48.270> of

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
that's that's kind of a question of

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.930 
that's that's kind of a question of
utility<00:06:48.960> another<00:06:49.200> problem<00:06:49.680> is<00:06:49.830> that<00:06:50.670> the

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
utility another problem is that the

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.570 
utility another problem is that the
issue<00:06:51.290> with<00:06:52.290> something<00:06:52.860> like<00:06:53.010> Google<00:06:53.220> Plus

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
issue with something like Google Plus

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.640 
issue with something like Google Plus
isn't<00:06:53.910> in<00:06:54.330> building<00:06:55.170> circles<00:06:55.560> because

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
isn't in building circles because

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.160 
isn't in building circles because
building<00:06:56.010> circles<00:06:56.340> is<00:06:56.460> easy<00:06:56.670> and<00:06:57.050> every<00:06:58.050> me

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
building circles is easy and every me

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.900 
building circles is easy and every me
assumes<00:06:58.590> that<00:06:58.830> that's<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.280> hardest<00:06:59.640> part

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.330 
assumes that that's the hardest part
like<00:07:00.810> for<00:07:01.110> example<00:07:01.140> the<00:07:01.770> University<00:07:02.310> of

like for example the University of
Michigan<00:07:04.640> circle<00:07:05.640> would<00:07:06.000> surely<00:07:06.240> be

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
Michigan circle would surely be

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.030 
Michigan circle would surely be
difficult<00:07:07.080> to<00:07:07.200> make<00:07:07.350> in<00:07:07.530> something<00:07:07.890> like

difficult to make in something like
