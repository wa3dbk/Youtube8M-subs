an<00:00:49.159> idea<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:49.519> temperatures<00:00:49.909> that<00:00:50.089> it<00:00:50.210> runs

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
an idea of the temperatures that it runs

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.750 
an idea of the temperatures that it runs
at<00:00:50.799> okay<00:00:51.799> there's<00:00:52.039> a<00:00:52.100> little<00:00:52.339> bit<00:00:52.459> of<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.549> breeze

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
at okay there's a little bit of a breeze

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
out here not much but we're looking at

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.069 
out here not much but we're looking at
136<00:00:56.690> ish<00:00:57.819> 120<00:00:58.819> ish<00:00:58.940> dipping<00:00:59.449> where<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.809> hitted

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
136 ish 120 ish dipping where you hitted

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.919 
136 ish 120 ish dipping where you hitted
that<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.039> they<00:01:01.760> do<00:01:01.819> run<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.119> little<00:01:02.420> warm<00:01:02.629> you

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
that so they do run a little warm you

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.299 
that so they do run a little warm you
know<00:01:03.019> but<00:01:03.499> most<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.799> these<00:01:03.920> little<00:01:04.129> small

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
know but most of these little small

version<00:01:07.880> ran<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:09.260> little<00:01:09.650> bit<00:01:09.830> warm<00:01:10.160> they<00:01:10.940> just

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
version ran a little bit warm they just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.610 
version ran a little bit warm they just
need<00:01:11.270> good<00:01:11.420> airflow<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.170> as<00:01:12.260> long<00:01:12.380> as<00:01:12.440> you<00:01:12.530> got

need good airflow so as long as you got
good<00:01:12.800> airflow<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.130> shouldn't<00:01:13.430> have<00:01:13.520> any

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
good airflow you shouldn't have any

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.370 
good airflow you shouldn't have any
problems<00:01:13.970> with<00:01:14.120> it<00:01:14.150> obviously<00:01:15.020> if<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.200> get<00:01:15.260> it

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
of what ecchi is on the monitor I'll

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.210 
of what ecchi is on the monitor I'll
have<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.780> work<00:01:41.870> on<00:01:42.050> that<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.350> see<00:01:43.040> what<00:01:43.100> the

have to work on that and see what the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.250 
have to work on that and see what the
problem<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:44.630> we're<00:01:44.780> gonna<00:01:44.870> do<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> little

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
problem is but we're gonna do a little

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.570 
problem is but we're gonna do a little
short<00:01:45.560> distance<00:01:45.890> test<00:01:46.100> here<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.400> we'll<00:01:46.490> walk

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
short distance test here and we'll walk

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.490 
short distance test here and we'll walk
out<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.940> end<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.930> pole<00:01:48.080> set<00:01:48.320> down

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
out to the end of the pole set down

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.250 
out to the end of the pole set down
there<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:49.190> about<00:01:52.810> probably<00:01:53.810> two<00:01:54.110> or<00:01:54.140> three

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
there it's about probably two or three

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.020 
there it's about probably two or three
football<00:01:54.680> fields<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.550> got<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.730> pretty

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
football fields so it's got a pretty

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.850 
football fields so it's got a pretty
good<00:01:56.240> distance<00:01:56.630> amount<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.380> we're

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
good distance amount to it so we're

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
good distance amount to it so we're
gonna<00:01:57.950> walk<00:01:58.130> down<00:01:58.310> there<00:01:58.460> we're<00:01:58.550> gonna<00:01:58.670> see<00:01:58.790> if

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
gonna walk down there we're gonna see if

transmitter and antenna down there and
we<00:03:58.230> have<00:03:58.380> perfect<00:03:58.740> almost<00:03:58.860> perfect<00:03:59.010> signal<00:03:59.550> so

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
we have perfect almost perfect signal so

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.410 
we have perfect almost perfect signal so
and<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:01.800> you<00:04:02.400> know<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.180> what<00:04:03.330> it

wall back down there we'll throw the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.189 
wall back down there we'll throw the
digital<00:04:19.350> thermometer<00:04:19.799> back<00:04:19.919> out<00:04:20.130> there<00:04:20.310> and

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
digital thermometer back out there and

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.619 
digital thermometer back out there and
see<00:04:21.680> what<00:04:21.829> we<00:04:22.009> we<00:04:22.370> read<00:04:22.580> on<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.759> video

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:23.629 
see what we we read on that video

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.529 
see what we we read on that video
transmitter<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.759> see<00:04:25.759> if<00:04:25.849> it<00:04:25.939> heated<00:04:26.120> up<00:04:26.300> any

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
transmitter and see if it heated up any

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.309 
transmitter and see if it heated up any
and<00:04:27.430> see<00:04:28.430> if<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.610> an<00:04:28.729> acceptable<00:04:29.240> level<00:04:29.419> so

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
and see if it's an acceptable level so

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:35.140 
and see if it's an acceptable level so
far<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:31.400> haven't<00:04:32.029> seen<00:04:32.180> any<00:04:32.479> lines<00:04:34.150> develop

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
far I haven't seen any lines develop

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.570 
far I haven't seen any lines develop
inside<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.629> video<00:04:35.870> here<00:04:36.169> which<00:04:37.009> is<00:04:37.129> typical

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
inside the video here which is typical

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.200 
inside the video here which is typical
for<00:04:37.789> a<00:04:39.129> video<00:04:40.129> transmitter<00:04:40.520> when<00:04:40.699> it<00:04:40.789> starts

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
for a video transmitter when it starts

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.830 
for a video transmitter when it starts
heating<00:04:41.360> up<00:04:41.569> to<00:04:41.749> a<00:04:41.779> point<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:42.169> it's<00:04:43.629> too<00:04:44.629> much

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
heating up to a point that it's too much

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.080 
heating up to a point that it's too much
thermally<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:46.370> one<00:04:46.520> here<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:46.759> perfectly

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
thermally this one here is perfectly

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.010 
thermally this one here is perfectly
clear<00:04:47.469> so<00:04:48.759> I<00:04:49.759> don't<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.569> it's<00:04:50.719> making<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
clear so I don't see that it's making a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.070 
clear so I don't see that it's making a
problem<00:04:51.740> if<00:04:52.370> by<00:04:52.580> well<00:04:52.909> within<00:04:53.210> its<00:04:53.270> operating

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
problem if by well within its operating

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.740 
problem if by well within its operating
temperatures<00:04:54.939> so<00:04:55.939> that's<00:04:58.300> gone<00:04:59.300> down<00:04:59.569> here

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
temperatures so that's gone down here

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.200 
temperatures so that's gone down here
huh<00:05:00.370> fast-forward<00:05:01.370> or<00:05:01.430> cut<00:05:01.610> through<00:05:01.849> this<00:05:02.000> so

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
huh fast-forward or cut through this so

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.649 
huh fast-forward or cut through this so
yeah<00:05:02.860> okay<00:05:03.860> we'll<00:05:04.759> get<00:05:04.849> back<00:05:05.000> up<00:05:05.180> here<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.539> can

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
yeah okay we'll get back up here you can

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.519 
yeah okay we'll get back up here you can
see<00:05:05.689> you<00:05:06.680> my<00:05:06.800> rig<00:05:07.039> here<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.960> what<00:05:09.139> working

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
see you my rig here this is what working

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.800 
see you my rig here this is what working
with<00:05:09.680> here<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:11.979> down<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.159> walk<00:05:13.569> sheet<00:05:14.569> it<00:05:14.689> was

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
with here and down and walk sheet it was

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.269 
with here and down and walk sheet it was
a<00:05:14.839> digital<00:05:15.080> thermometer<00:05:15.529> here<00:05:15.889> into<00:05:16.159> the

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 
a digital thermometer here into the

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:24.429 
a digital thermometer here into the
world<00:05:16.870> looking<00:05:17.870> in<00:05:17.990> sister-wives<00:05:23.379> okay<00:05:24.379> so

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
world looking in sister-wives okay so

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:31.059 
world looking in sister-wives okay so
I'm<00:05:25.219> seeing<00:05:25.580> peaks<00:05:25.969> of<00:05:26.210> about<00:05:26.569> 160<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:30.069> you

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
I'm seeing peaks of about 160 and you

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.959 
I'm seeing peaks of about 160 and you
know<00:05:31.159> it's<00:05:31.310> pretty<00:05:31.550> warm<00:05:31.819> I<00:05:33.639> mean<00:05:34.639> it's<00:05:34.849> not

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
know it's pretty warm I mean it's not

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.240 
know it's pretty warm I mean it's not
it's<00:05:35.479> not<00:05:35.629> to<00:05:35.779> the<00:05:35.870> point<00:05:35.990> is<00:05:36.169> on<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.860> backside

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
it's not to the point is on the backside

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.409 
it's not to the point is on the backside
that<00:05:37.279> you're<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> little<00:05:37.759> bit<00:05:37.849> warm<00:05:38.060> we've<00:05:38.300> been

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
that you're a little bit warm we've been

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:53.590 
that you're a little bit warm we've been
running<00:05:38.839> you<00:05:39.020> see<00:05:39.669> we<00:05:40.669> get<00:05:40.849> back<00:05:41.060> here

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.660 

mmm<00:05:54.470> this<00:05:54.710> for<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:54.890> hotspot<00:05:55.340> right<00:05:55.370> there

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
mmm this for the hotspot right there

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.890 
mmm this for the hotspot right there
okay<00:05:55.880> there<00:05:56.030> we<00:05:56.150> go<00:05:56.300> that's<00:05:56.600> what<00:05:56.720> I<00:05:56.750> was

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
okay there we go that's what I was

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.310 
okay there we go that's what I was
feeling<00:05:57.020> at<00:05:57.260> yeah<00:06:00.280> not<00:06:01.280> too<00:06:01.460> bad<00:06:02.290> there's<00:06:03.290> one

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
feeling at yeah not too bad there's one

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.140 
feeling at yeah not too bad there's one
30s<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.950> back<00:06:04.160> it's<00:06:04.760> like<00:06:04.880> we're<00:06:05.000> peaking

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
30s in the back it's like we're peaking

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.630 
30s in the back it's like we're peaking
up<00:06:05.420> to<00:06:06.940> about<00:06:07.940> 160<00:06:08.150> up<00:06:08.690> front<00:06:09.340> like<00:06:10.340> I<00:06:10.430> said

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
up to about 160 up front like I said

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.460 
up to about 160 up front like I said
it's<00:06:10.760> not<00:06:10.850> too<00:06:11.060> too<00:06:11.270> bad<00:06:11.480> there's<00:06:12.200> a<00:06:12.290> little

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
it's not too too bad there's a little

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.080 
it's not too too bad there's a little
bit<00:06:12.560> of<00:06:12.620> breeze<00:06:12.800> out<00:06:12.980> here<00:06:13.010> but<00:06:13.310> obviously<00:06:13.700> if

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
bit of breeze out here but obviously if

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.440 
bit of breeze out here but obviously if
we<00:06:14.210> had<00:06:14.330> propwash<00:06:15.610> it<00:06:16.610> would<00:06:16.790> be<00:06:16.940> as<00:06:17.030> hot<00:06:17.180> as<00:06:17.330> it

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
we had propwash it would be as hot as it

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.160 
we had propwash it would be as hot as it
is<00:06:17.570> now<00:06:17.810> so<00:06:18.490> anyway<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:20.090> there<00:06:20.720> you<00:06:20.810> go

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
is now so anyway so there you go

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.750 
is now so anyway so there you go
I'll<00:06:21.560> see<00:06:21.770> how<00:06:21.860> this<00:06:22.070> looks<00:06:22.220> in<00:06:22.370> the<00:06:22.550> camera

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
I'll see how this looks in the camera

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.300 
I'll see how this looks in the camera
and<00:06:23.360> if<00:06:23.480> it<00:06:23.630> there's<00:06:23.810> grit<00:06:24.020> off<00:06:24.140> I'll<00:06:24.950> post<00:06:25.190> up

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
and if it there's grit off I'll post up

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.920 
and if it there's grit off I'll post up
the<00:06:25.460> video<00:06:25.700> instead<00:06:26.180> of<00:06:26.240> trying<00:06:26.420> to<00:06:26.480> fix

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
the video instead of trying to fix

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.920 
the video instead of trying to fix
monitor<00:06:27.440> but<00:06:27.590> so<00:06:28.340> far<00:06:28.520> camera<00:06:29.510> looks<00:06:29.690> very

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
monitor but so far camera looks very

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.750 
monitor but so far camera looks very
good<00:06:30.140> as<00:06:30.350> she<00:06:30.500> looks<00:06:30.680> better<00:06:30.800> than<00:06:31.010> the<00:06:31.130> 600<00:06:31.550> TV

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
good as she looks better than the 600 TV

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.940 
good as she looks better than the 600 TV
oh<00:06:31.790> I<00:06:31.910> have<00:06:32.180> on<00:06:32.300> my<00:06:32.450> camera<00:06:32.690> or<00:06:32.960> all<00:06:33.140> my<00:06:33.290> mini

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
oh I have on my camera or all my mini

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.190 
oh I have on my camera or all my mini
quad<00:06:34.160> now<00:06:34.690> and<00:06:35.690> that<00:06:36.140> mini<00:06:36.980> video<00:06:37.550> transmitter

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
quad now and that mini video transmitter

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.520 
quad now and that mini video transmitter
is<00:06:39.200> the<00:06:39.320> same<00:06:39.500> size<00:06:39.710> as<00:06:39.890> a<00:06:39.950> TS<00:06:40.780> 58<00:06:41.780> 23<00:06:42.290> which<00:06:42.500> is

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
is the same size as a TS 58 23 which is

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.130 
is the same size as a TS 58 23 which is
a<00:06:42.710> 200<00:06:43.430> milliwatts<00:06:43.700> but<00:06:44.630> this<00:06:44.720> one<00:06:44.900> puts<00:06:45.050> out

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
a 200 milliwatts but this one puts out

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.140 
a 200 milliwatts but this one puts out
600<00:06:45.650> bill<00:06:45.770> watts<00:06:45.980> so<00:06:46.100> little<00:06:46.910> bit<00:06:47.000> more

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
600 bill watts so little bit more

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.440 
600 bill watts so little bit more
penetrating<00:06:47.540> power<00:06:47.920> so<00:06:48.920> most<00:06:49.790> likely<00:06:49.880> this

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
penetrating power so most likely this

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.550 
penetrating power so most likely this
one<00:06:50.630> will<00:06:50.720> be<00:06:50.810> going<00:06:50.990> to<00:06:51.050> my<00:06:51.140> quad<00:06:51.470> and

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
one will be going to my quad and

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.950 
one will be going to my quad and
replacing<00:06:52.010> the<00:06:52.420> one<00:06:53.420> that<00:06:53.540> I<00:06:53.570> currently<00:06:53.750> have

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
replacing the one that I currently have
