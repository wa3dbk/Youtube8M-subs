turnovers<00:00:52.590> well<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.149> that's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
turnovers well and I don't think that's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
turnovers well and I don't think that's
an<00:00:54.449> indication<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.199> any<00:00:55.890> shape<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.370> form<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
an indication in any shape or form of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.119

Riverside having too much trouble yet
but<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.579> think<00:01:00.000> Mike<00:01:00.449> Wake<00:01:00.629> Forest's<00:01:01.020> may<00:01:01.199> have

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
but I think Mike Wake Forest's may have

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
but I think Mike Wake Forest's may have
