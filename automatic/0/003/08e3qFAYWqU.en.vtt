00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
filling your ribbon we're gonna start

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.740 
filling your ribbon we're gonna start
off<00:00:46.340> with<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.790> tree<00:00:47.030> base<00:00:47.270> ribbon<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:49.750> we're

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
off with the tree base ribbon and we're

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.400 
off with the tree base ribbon and we're
gonna<00:00:50.840> put<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.140> into<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.590> alligator<00:00:52.040> clip

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410

to fold over the back and I'm just going
halfway<00:01:32.140> I'm<00:01:33.140> gonna<00:01:33.290> cut<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.680> about<00:01:33.920> halfway

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
halfway I'm gonna cut it about halfway

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.750 
halfway I'm gonna cut it about halfway
near<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.930> top<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:39.040> just<00:01:40.040> snip<00:01:40.280> right<00:01:40.490> there

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.940 

and<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.759> will<00:01:50.000> be<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:52.579> tree<00:01:52.880> trunk<00:01:53.210> base<00:01:53.950> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
and that will be the tree trunk base and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.310 
and that will be the tree trunk base and
then<00:01:55.789> we're<00:01:55.969> going<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.329> take<00:01:57.020> your<00:01:57.170> other

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
ribbon which will be the tree and you

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.940 
ribbon which will be the tree and you
want<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.159> put<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.579> at<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.789> top<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.500> add<00:02:03.920> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
little bit of glue and this is the top

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.759 
little bit of glue and this is the top
where<00:02:09.470> where<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.069> opens<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:11.530> you'll<00:02:12.530> want<00:02:12.709> to

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769

take that ribbon and just glue it to the
top<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.879> then<00:02:17.000> we're<00:02:17.120> gonna<00:02:17.209> start<00:02:17.569> folding

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
top and then we're gonna start folding

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.870 
top and then we're gonna start folding
and<00:02:18.530> we're<00:02:18.680> gonna<00:02:18.799> work<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.220> layers<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
and we're gonna work in layers and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.780 
and we're gonna work in layers and
you'll<00:02:23.090> take<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.510> first<00:02:24.160> layer<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.640> want

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
you'll take the first layer and you want

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
you'll take the first layer and you want
to<00:02:25.849> put<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.269> dab<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.780> glue<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.290> very

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
to put a little dab of glue on the very

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.789 
to put a little dab of glue on the very
bottom<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.069> ribbon<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:29.569> make<00:02:30.530> sure<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
bottom of the ribbon and make sure you

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.530 
bottom of the ribbon and make sure you
don't<00:02:30.980> get<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.459> top<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.450> you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
don't get it on the top so that you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.229 
don't get it on the top so that you
don't<00:02:32.720> see<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.959> glue<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.459> just<00:02:34.640> fold<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.120> over

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
don't see the glue and just fold it over

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.780 
don't see the glue and just fold it over
this<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.690> gonna<00:02:35.959> be<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> tiny<00:02:36.500> layer<00:02:36.829> so<00:02:37.760> you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
this is gonna be a tiny layer so you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.420 
this is gonna be a tiny layer so you
don't<00:02:38.030> want<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.180> very<00:02:38.720> big<00:02:39.099> because<00:02:40.099> this<00:02:40.310> will

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
don't want it very big because this will

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.789 
don't want it very big because this will
be<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.640> top<00:02:40.849> of<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.090> tree<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:42.709> we're

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
be the top of the tree and then we're

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.500 
be the top of the tree and then we're
gonna<00:02:42.890> go<00:02:43.099> down<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.209> gonna<00:02:44.299> be<00:02:44.480> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
gonna go down and it's just gonna be a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.740 
gonna go down and it's just gonna be a
little<00:02:44.780> squiggly<00:02:45.140> tree<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.660> then<00:02:47.660> we're

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
little squiggly tree and then we're

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.869 
little squiggly tree and then we're
gonna<00:02:47.870> fold<00:02:48.170> back<00:02:48.470> over<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.190> each<00:02:49.400> time<00:02:49.730> I

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
gonna fold back over and each time I

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.720 
gonna fold back over and each time I
fold<00:02:50.150> over<00:02:50.829> we're<00:02:51.829> gonna<00:02:51.890> get<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.160> little<00:02:52.310> wider

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
fold over we're gonna get a little wider

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.760 
fold over we're gonna get a little wider
but<00:02:54.340> another<00:02:55.340> dab<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.180> glue

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.950 

and<00:03:00.100> as<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:00.850> I'm<00:03:01.360> getting<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.750> little

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
and as you can see I'm getting a little

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.940 
and as you can see I'm getting a little
bit<00:03:02.320> whiter<00:03:02.620> than<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.040> was<00:03:03.370> before<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:04.950> press

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
bit whiter than I was before just press

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.410 
bit whiter than I was before just press
it<00:03:06.130> all<00:03:06.250> down<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:08.670> we're<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.700> gonna<00:03:09.940> do<00:03:10.210> this
