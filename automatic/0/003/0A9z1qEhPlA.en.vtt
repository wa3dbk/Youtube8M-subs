keys except for the numpad and then you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
keys except for the numpad and then you
do<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> next<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:54.720> it<00:00:55.020> turns<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.559> the

numpad then the last mode cycles through

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
numpad then the last mode cycles through
the<00:01:01.230> brightness<00:01:01.680> settings<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.700> fades<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the brightness settings like it fades in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.450 
the brightness settings like it fades in
and<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.229> highest<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.740> the<00:01:04.830> lowest

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.999 

and<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.850> pretty<00:01:09.030> bright<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> just

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
and it can go pretty bright so I just

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.170 
and it can go pretty bright so I just
turn<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.250> lights<00:01:11.460> off<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.820> show<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
turn the lights off and show you the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.310 
turn the lights off and show you the
different<00:01:12.890> right<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> settings<00:01:15.259> okay<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
different right in the settings okay so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.930 
different right in the settings okay so
this<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.180> default<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> lowest

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.160 

and<00:01:22.210> then<00:01:22.690> it<00:01:22.870> can<00:01:23.080> go<00:01:23.200> all<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.440> way<00:01:23.590> up<00:01:23.740> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and then it can go all the way up to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.960 
and then it can go all the way up to
that<00:01:26.170> right<00:01:26.440> which<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.280> pretty<00:01:27.400> bright<00:01:27.730> like

I'm not sure exactly what that does have

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.860 
I'm not sure exactly what that does have
to<00:02:18.790> look<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.090> manual<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.630> key<00:02:22.810> this

keyboard can plug in with either USB or
ps<00:02:28.750> 2<00:02:29.440> i'm<00:02:29.680> using<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.340> ps2<00:02:30.790> adapter<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.870> i

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
ps 2 i'm using the ps2 adapter so that i

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.990 
ps 2 i'm using the ps2 adapter so that i
can<00:02:32.019> get<00:02:32.380> full<00:02:33.280> r<00:02:33.849> n<00:02:34.380> NK<00:02:35.380> rot<00:02:35.830> n<00:02:36.220> key<00:02:36.489> roll<00:02:36.700> over

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
can get full r n NK rot n key roll over

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.570 
can get full r n NK rot n key roll over
so<00:02:37.900> if<00:02:37.959> i<00:02:37.989> open<00:02:38.140> up<00:02:39.120> notepad<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:42.400> can

my<00:03:24.019> brother<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.349> going<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> hold<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.799> camera

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
my brother is going to hold the camera

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.110 
my brother is going to hold the camera
because<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.640> can't<00:03:26.230> do<00:03:27.230> both<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.819> just

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
because I can't do both so I just

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:39.530 
because I can't do both so I just
tightened<00:03:31.060> oops

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.940 

so<00:03:40.540> that's<00:03:40.720> what<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.140> sounds<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:41.819> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
so that's what it sounds like the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.380 
so that's what it sounds like the
dinging<00:03:44.950> was<00:03:45.160> because<00:03:45.370> i<00:03:45.489> was<00:03:45.520> accidentally

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
dinging was because i was accidentally

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.940 
dinging was because i was accidentally
had<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> recycle<00:03:47.230> bin<00:03:47.260> selected<00:03:47.830> or

had the recycle bin selected or
something<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.430> but<00:03:49.180> yeah<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.739> that's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
something like that but yeah so that's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.240 
something like that but yeah so that's
just<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.520> ducky<00:03:52.080> I'll<00:03:53.080> show<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:53.860> what<00:03:54.010> comes
