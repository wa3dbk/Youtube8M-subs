00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
so here's the beauty now I used some

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:59.569 
so here's the beauty now I used some
foam<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.189> just<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.579> particular<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:59.430> this

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
foam here just to particular in this

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.970 
foam here just to particular in this
class<00:02:59.849> is<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> window<00:03:00.629> it's<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.439> made<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.799> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
class is a window it's just made of a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.270 
class is a window it's just made of a
jewel<00:03:02.640> case<00:03:02.849> cover<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:07.560> course<00:03:07.829> -<00:03:08.040> Jack

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
jewel case cover of course - Jack

jewel case cover of course - Jack
connectors<00:03:08.719> here<00:03:09.719> and<00:03:10.099> then<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.219> used<00:03:11.459> two

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
connectors here and then I used two

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.160 
connectors here and then I used two
capacitors<00:03:12.439> one<00:03:13.439> resistor<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.540> 1.5

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
capacitors one resistor of the 1.5

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.849 
capacitors one resistor of the 1.5
Michael<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:18.560> 10<00:03:19.560> kilo<00:03:19.980> ohm<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.859> actually

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
Michael and 10 kilo ohm and actually

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.659 
Michael and 10 kilo ohm and actually
it's<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.250> wired<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.819> your<00:03:24.060> guitar<00:03:24.450> goes<00:03:24.659> in

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
it's just wired so your guitar goes in

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.839 
it's just wired so your guitar goes in
through<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.939> latch<00:03:27.629> which<00:03:28.519> when<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.639> press

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
through the latch which when you press

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.349 
through the latch which when you press
it<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.030> goes<00:03:31.250> directly<00:03:32.250> into<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.629> iPhone<00:03:34.069> and

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
it it goes directly into the iPhone and

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.750 
it it goes directly into the iPhone and
when<00:03:36.359> you<00:03:36.450> press<00:03:36.659> again<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:38.069> goes<00:03:38.310> from<00:03:38.549> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
when you press again it goes from the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.339 
when you press again it goes from the
guitar<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.829> just<00:03:40.829> routed<00:03:41.189> directly<00:03:41.579> opposite

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
guitar and just routed directly opposite

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.360 
guitar and just routed directly opposite
into<00:03:43.349> your<00:03:44.419> pedal<00:03:45.419> board<00:03:45.709> or<00:03:46.709> directly<00:03:47.159> into

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
into your pedal board or directly into

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.990 
into your pedal board or directly into
your<00:03:47.400> amplifier<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.079> simple<00:03:49.849> then<00:03:50.849> you

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
your amplifier it's that simple then you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:04.280 
your amplifier it's that simple then you
just<00:03:51.209> slow<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.079> your<00:03:52.229> iPhone<00:03:53.510> it's<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.629> easy

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.349 

you
