 [Music] 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:21.359
 [Music] 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.400
 It looks just made that you were me 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.010
 asking to do this hair cleaning 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.750
 who are aran since then are in to arrive 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.119
 the summer is the best time to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.700
 play accessories to teach 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.920
 You are very easy to be 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.600
 I'll make you one later, you want to play. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 make several prints several things 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 different because it is very easy and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 leaving the look very fun then 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.879
 You want to learn how to make your 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 curls in hair very easy just 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.090
 keep watching the video 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 [Music] 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.719
 and to make this track had a wire 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.640
 What you asked me for so long. 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 need to have been I'm using 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 The one I know about 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.299
 cotton it exists of several prints 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.700
 will need also glue cloth pliers 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.490
 scissors wire that more thin more 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.619
 malleable and the first thing then that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
 You 're going to measure your head already. 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.869
 leaving more or less the leftovers you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.909
 or in your cleaning in my case of 72 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.740
 centimeters so I'll cut a strip 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.630
 of fabric actually of four 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.090
 centimeters more than later people 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.240
 cuts the excesses so my aunt has 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.909
 76 centimeters in length by 12 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.460
 inches wide so you pull the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.590
 measure your head and cut a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.509
 four centimeters more for later 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 cut the works to round the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.310
 tips and do not get too short 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.619
 now we will stick our little stick 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.659
 so I do reap all the border leaves 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.220
 this space without glue 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.939
 there and then we'll put the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.130
 wire 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.890
 if you want you can do it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.259
 in the sewing machine can align hand 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.360
 does the way you find it easier 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.490
 the way you have more ability and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.829
 now it's just so many dots so 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.590
 before we left 34 centimeters 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.720
 more to have this leftovers then it's just 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.340
 remember and queue 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.340
 to keep everything tight 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.020
 [Music] 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 So you let it dry well I waited for ten 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.040
 15 minutes and now it's just to divert our 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.560
 faixinha and with the help of a pencil one 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.580
 scissors you straighten the tips go 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.580
 be very right 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.199
 [Music] 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.430
 [Music] 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:17.350
 [Music] 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.260
 and for the part of the wire is the same thing 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.270
 of fabric you measure your head and take off 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.160
 four centimeters more because 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.290
 People need to roll up the tips with 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.180
 pliers so that there is no danger of 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.310
 fabric and also not get hurt 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.680
 after rolling the ends orani is just 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.050
 put there in our little 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.120
 set it well and now it's just over 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.900
 closing the space that was opened and 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.900
 expect to dry 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:04:05.100
 [Music] 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.160
 and the little hair was ready 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.050
 after you make one you add and 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.120
 want to make various colors and various 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.160
 and there are various forms of 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.950
 be used but the one I use the most is 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.990
 passing under the hair at the nape of the neck and 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.030
 by rotating the top part you can then 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.770
 adapt your used style the way you 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.139
 you think it's cool 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.389
 besides these hairstyles there are 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.280
 many other easy-to-use 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.030
 be made that I can teach 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.040
 you 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.720
 so if you have interest you commit 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.940
 down here so that I know that you 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.620
 They want and I can record for you. 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.900
 ah and do not forget to click like 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.180
 is also very important and this is a 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.290
 big kiss and until the next video 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:56.990
