me<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.760> say<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> main<00:01:00.390> reason<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
me but I would say the main reason is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
me but I would say the main reason is
because<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> play<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> bad<00:01:02.640> guy<00:01:02.670> in

because we do get to play the bad guy in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.729 
because we do get to play the bad guy in
this<00:01:03.300> game<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> switches

this game and it just kind of switches

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.410 
this game and it just kind of switches
things<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> best<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.210> really

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
things up a bit and best what really

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
things up a bit and best what really
makes<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> whole<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.799> cool

losing too many crew members so with

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.160 
losing too many crew members so with
that<00:02:30.970> said<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.450> definitely<00:02:31.930> gonna<00:02:32.050> be

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
that said it is definitely gonna be

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.840 
that said it is definitely gonna be
something<00:02:32.560> really<00:02:32.740> challenging<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.610> game

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
something really challenging in the game

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.190 
something really challenging in the game
but<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.150> would<00:02:34.360> imagine<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.900> gonna<00:02:35.020> be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
but I would imagine it's gonna be

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.900 
but I would imagine it's gonna be
something<00:02:35.590> really<00:02:35.800> fun<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> same

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
something really fun to do at the same

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.170 
something really fun to do at the same
time<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.860> next<00:02:39.160> fact<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.520> actually<00:02:39.670> really

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
time so the next fact is actually really

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.970 
time so the next fact is actually really
really<00:02:40.300> cool<00:02:40.780> because<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.350> about<00:02:41.650> four<00:02:41.860> new

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
really cool because it is about four new

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830 
really cool because it is about four new
weapons<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.910> game<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.450> these<00:02:43.630> are<00:02:43.750> gonna

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
weapons in this game and these are gonna

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.580 
trail of fire behind to burn enemy ships
and<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:49.180> are<00:02:49.270> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.600> also<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.110> Puckle

continuous machine gun like fire so if

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.270 
continuous machine gun like fire so if
it<00:02:55.480> does<00:02:55.690> sound<00:02:55.930> really<00:02:56.230> insane<00:02:56.740> but<00:02:56.980> I'm<00:02:57.100> just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280

looking forward to leaving trails of

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.600 
looking forward to leaving trails of
fire<00:02:58.900> behind<00:02:59.320> me<00:02:59.500> not<00:02:59.740> only<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.070> burn<00:03:00.340> the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
fire behind me not only to burn the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.400 
fire behind me not only to burn the
enemy's<00:03:00.970> ships<00:03:01.300> but<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.600> course<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.020> burn<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
enemy's ships but of course to burn the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.560 
enemy's ships but of course to burn the
enemies<00:03:02.800> as<00:03:03.010> well<00:03:03.190> because<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.940> don't<00:03:04.270> know<00:03:04.390> why

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
enemies as well because I don't know why

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.240 
enemies as well because I don't know why
but<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:04.960> some<00:03:05.110> reason<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.620> always<00:03:05.800> fun

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
but for some reason it's always fun

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.740 
but for some reason it's always fun

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
of possibilities you can run through ice

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.740 
of possibilities you can run through ice
sheets<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.040> discover<00:03:24.490> hidden<00:03:24.730> locations<00:03:25.540> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
sheets to discover hidden locations and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.230 
sheets to discover hidden locations and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.660 
well but Assassin's Creed rogue it's
just<00:04:36.440> something<00:04:36.770> really<00:04:36.950> different<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.640> think

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
just something really different I think

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.460 
just something really different I think
that's<00:04:38.150> just<00:04:38.330> what<00:04:38.510> makes<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.170> good

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
that's just what makes it a really good

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.500 
that's just what makes it a really good
game<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:40.010> far<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.640> then<00:04:41.000> though<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.120> can't

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
game so far and then though I can't

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.880 
game so far and then though I can't
really<00:04:41.630> judge<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.020> at<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.440> moment<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:42.860> time

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
really judge it at this moment in time

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.620 
really judge it at this moment in time
since<00:04:43.370> we<00:04:43.520> only<00:04:43.640> saw<00:04:43.850> like<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.060> minute<00:04:44.450> long
