everywhere media blasting works a lot

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.429 
everywhere media blasting works a lot
better<00:01:10.240> for<00:01:12.180> their<00:01:13.180> bare<00:01:13.720> shelves<00:01:14.110> bare

bodies so what you'll see Mike doing

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.920 
bodies so what you'll see Mike doing
here<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:17.909> mike<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.120> using<00:01:19.450> mechanical

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
here is a mike is using mechanical

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.310 
here is a mike is using mechanical
stripping<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.380> basically<00:01:20.680> got<00:01:20.920> sandpaper

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
stripping you basically got sandpaper

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.110 
stripping you basically got sandpaper
they<00:01:23.320> also<00:01:23.500> can<00:01:23.770> use<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.040> grinding<00:01:24.760> disc<00:01:24.970> in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
they also can use a grinding disc in

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.090 
they also can use a grinding disc in
some<00:01:25.330> areas<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:26.200> he's<00:01:26.320> got<00:01:26.470> sandpaper<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
some areas but he's got sandpaper and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.430 
some areas but he's got sandpaper and
he's<00:01:27.220> sanding<00:01:28.150> off<00:01:28.299> all<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.780> old<00:01:28.810> paint<00:01:29.140> works

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440

he's sanding off all the old paint works
pretty<00:01:29.620> effectively<00:01:30.190> using<00:01:30.880> what<00:01:31.120> grit<00:01:31.360> here

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
pretty effectively using what grit here

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.280 
pretty effectively using what grit here
8880<00:01:33.460> grades<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.020> works<00:01:35.200> pretty

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
8880 grades so it works pretty

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.310 
8880 grades so it works pretty
effectively<00:01:35.920> pretty<00:01:36.790> quick<00:01:37.030> some<00:01:37.450> areas<00:01:37.750> and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
effectively pretty quick some areas and

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.469 
effectively pretty quick some areas and
on<00:01:38.680> some<00:01:38.979> vehicles<00:01:39.130> you'll<00:01:39.549> see<00:01:39.729> us<00:01:39.850> also<00:01:40.090> use

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
on some vehicles you'll see us also use

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.830 
on some vehicles you'll see us also use
a<00:01:41.159> aircraft<00:01:42.159> aircraft<00:01:42.909> quality

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
a aircraft aircraft quality

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.050 
a aircraft aircraft quality
chemical<00:01:45.380> stripper<00:01:45.829> first<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.030> will

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
chemical stripper first and that will

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.520 
chemical stripper first and that will
get<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:47.329> lot<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.750> paint<00:01:47.990> off<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.320> then<00:01:48.409> we

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
get a lot of the paint off and then we

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.300 
get a lot of the paint off and then we
come<00:01:48.740> back<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.159> then<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.369> mechanically<00:01:49.909> strip

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
come back and then we mechanically strip

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.609 
come back and then we mechanically strip
so<00:01:52.310> once<00:01:52.520> Mike<00:01:53.060> bedrolls<00:01:53.569> is<00:01:53.810> done<00:01:54.109> what<00:01:54.439> he's

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
so once Mike bedrolls is done what he's

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.899 
so once Mike bedrolls is done what he's
going<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.829> be<00:01:54.890> able<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.219> do<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.520> going<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.819> be

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
going to be able to do is going to be

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.999 
going to be able to do is going to be
able<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.210> see<00:01:56.450> exactly<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.649> was<00:01:57.679> under<00:01:57.979> the
