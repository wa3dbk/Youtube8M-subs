00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
what you're going to be making the wings

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.080 
what you're going to be making the wings
out<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.520> want<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> cut<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> very

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
out of so you don't want to cut it very

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
out of so you don't want to cut it very
carefully<00:01:39.570> very<00:01:40.079> gently<00:01:40.439> maybe<00:01:40.920> make<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
carefully very gently maybe make a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
carefully very gently maybe make a
couple<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> guiding<00:01:42.180> marx's<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.869> want

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
couple of guiding marx's you don't want

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
couple of guiding marx's you don't want
to<00:01:43.049> cut<00:01:43.170> too<00:01:43.320> small<00:01:43.560> too<00:01:44.100> short<00:01:44.399> too<00:01:44.520> little

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to cut too small too short too little

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.249 
to cut too small too short too little
because<00:01:44.850> can't<00:01:45.240> take<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> second<00:01:45.899> chance<00:01:46.079> back

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
because can't take a second chance back

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.330 
because can't take a second chance back
at<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.470> unless<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> recut<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
at this unless you want to recut the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.310 
at this unless you want to recut the
Apple<00:01:47.759> after<00:01:48.420> you're<00:01:48.600> done<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> peel

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
Apple after you're done with that peel

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
Apple after you're done with that peel
it<00:01:49.409> off<00:01:49.470> should<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.939> you're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it off should look like that now you're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
it off should look like that now you're
going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> cut<00:01:51.630> another<00:01:51.750> close<00:01:52.350> close

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
going to want to cut another close close

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990 
going to want to cut another close close
you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> without<00:01:53.100> breaking<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> edge

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you can without breaking it to the edge

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
you can without breaking it to the edge
and<00:01:54.390> I'll<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> other<00:01:55.380> side

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and I'll do that on the other side

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.749 
and I'll do that on the other side
because<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> put<00:01:56.520> wings

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
because you would want to put wings

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.959 
because you would want to put wings
inside<00:01:57.390> wings<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.070> looks<00:01:59.430> cool<00:01:59.729> with

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
inside wings here now it looks cool with

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.330 
inside wings here now it looks cool with
just<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.540> maybe<00:02:01.320> three<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.219> what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
just two maybe three but you know what

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
just two maybe three but you know what
looks<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.880> cool<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.689> wings<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.290> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
looks really cool for wings so you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.050 
looks really cool for wings so you
cannot<00:02:04.500> treat<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.860> very<00:02:05.310> carefully<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.909> as

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
cannot treat this very carefully and as

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.580 
cannot treat this very carefully and as
close<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> edge<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> take

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
close as you can to the edge you take

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.869 
close as you can to the edge you take
your<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.099> honestly<00:02:08.429> talking<00:02:08.700> about

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
your time this honestly talking about

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
your time this honestly talking about
five<00:02:09.179> minutes<00:02:09.450> per<00:02:09.690> slice<00:02:10.069> now<00:02:11.069> you're<00:02:11.220> going

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
five minutes per slice now you're going

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.589 
five minutes per slice now you're going
to<00:02:11.400> want<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.910> second<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> made

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
to want to take that second one you made

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.430 
to want to take that second one you made
off<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
off and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230

another<00:02:13.890> incision<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.550> close<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
another incision as close as you can to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.240 
another incision as close as you can to
the<00:02:15.390> edge<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> other<00:02:16.950> side

the edge and get in on the other side
and<00:02:17.520> try<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.060> close<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.870> again

completely because I did that several

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
we can hear now on this side ended up

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.670 
we can hear now on this side ended up
not<00:02:29.910> getting<00:02:30.000> as<00:02:30.210> much<00:02:30.240> as<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.600> wanted<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.650> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
not getting as much as I wanted to so I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.290 
not getting as much as I wanted to so I
just<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.280> bit<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> tiny<00:02:33.000> skin

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
just got a little bit of the tiny skin

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
just got a little bit of the tiny skin
but<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.570> still<00:02:33.810> looks<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.350> cool<00:02:34.530> just

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
but it still looks just as cool just

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.290 
but it still looks just as cool just
great<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.280> don't<00:02:35.490> worry<00:02:35.670> about<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
great and don't worry about it if you

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.750 
great and don't worry about it if you
mess<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:37.400> you're<00:02:38.400> going<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.580> want<00:02:38.700> to

mess that up you're going to want to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.160 
mess that up you're going to want to
construct<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.420> together<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.020> should

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
construct it all together and it should

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.330 
construct it all together and it should
look<00:02:40.230> something<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> can

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
look something like this just so you can

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.620 
look something like this just so you can
kind<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.580> measure<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.910> out<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.210> see<00:02:42.360> how<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
kind of measure it out and see how it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570 
kind of measure it out and see how it
looks<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.340> style

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
looks to you and if you like that style

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.040 
looks to you and if you like that style
better<00:02:44.820> they're<00:02:45.360> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.570> get<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.960> other

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
better they're going to get to the other

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.690 
better they're going to get to the other
side<00:02:46.380> also<00:02:46.710> bah<00:02:47.340> bah<00:02:47.700> bah<00:02:49.130> now<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.550> both
