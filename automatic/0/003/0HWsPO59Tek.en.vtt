sample<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.230> these<00:00:38.410> in<00:00:38.680> yesterday<00:00:39.219> actually

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
sample of these in yesterday actually

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.600 
sample of these in yesterday actually
they're<00:00:40.480> not<00:00:40.629> released<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:42.010> market<00:00:42.370> quite

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
they're not released to the market quite

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.670 
they're not released to the market quite
yet<00:00:42.879> but<00:00:43.660> they<00:00:43.750> should<00:00:43.899> be<00:00:44.020> shipping<00:00:44.230> fairly

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
yet but they should be shipping fairly

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.130 
yet but they should be shipping fairly
shortly<00:00:45.010> but<00:00:45.879> we<00:00:46.000> just<00:00:46.180> got<00:00:46.329> this<00:00:46.450> demo<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:46.930> and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
shortly but we just got this demo in and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.960 
shortly but we just got this demo in and
then<00:00:47.380> listening<00:00:47.680> to<00:00:47.770> it<00:00:47.980> quite<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.610> bit<00:00:48.790> here

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
then listening to it quite a bit here

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.220 
then listening to it quite a bit here
for<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.420> past<00:00:49.630> day<00:00:49.810> or<00:00:49.840> so<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.989> thing

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
for the past day or so first thing

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.470 
for the past day or so first thing
that's<00:00:54.040> kind<00:00:54.310> of<00:00:54.340> interesting<00:00:54.430> on<00:00:54.910> these<00:00:55.180> is

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
that's kind of interesting on these is

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.410 
that's kind of interesting on these is
the<00:00:55.930> way<00:00:56.050> that<00:00:56.260> they<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.970> bass<00:00:58.149> response

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
the way that they got the bass response

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.810 
the way that they got the bass response
out<00:00:59.020> of<00:00:59.050> them<00:00:59.320> they<00:00:59.800> actually<00:01:00.130> created<00:01:00.520> a

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
out of them they actually created a

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.170 
out of them they actually created a
low-pass<00:01:01.390> filter<00:01:01.420> which<00:01:02.110> is<00:01:02.880> basically<00:01:03.880> kind

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
low-pass filter which is basically kind

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.670 
low-pass filter which is basically kind
of<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.329> channel<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:05.049> they<00:01:05.140> created<00:01:05.530> with<00:01:05.649> a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
of a channel that they created with a

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.010 
of a channel that they created with a
bunch<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.950> stainless<00:01:06.340> steel<00:01:06.520> plates<00:01:06.939> that<00:01:07.930> if

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
bunch of stainless steel plates that if

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.389 
bunch of stainless steel plates that if
you<00:01:08.140> were<00:01:08.229> stretch<00:01:08.560> out<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:08.950> about<00:01:09.100> four

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
you were stretch out is about four

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.090 
you were stretch out is about four
inches<00:01:09.430> long<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.930> effective<00:01:11.409> effectively

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
inches long and it effective effectively

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.840 
inches long and it effective effectively
helps<00:01:12.399> roll-off<00:01:13.649> upper<00:01:14.649> bass<00:01:14.920> frequencies<00:01:15.579> so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
helps roll-off upper bass frequencies so

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.449 
helps roll-off upper bass frequencies so
that<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.060> just<00:01:16.240> get<00:01:16.420> true<00:01:16.810> bass<00:01:17.409> sub<00:01:18.249> bass

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:18.459 
that you just get true bass sub bass

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:20.489 
that you just get true bass sub bass
impact<00:01:18.999> out<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.509> low<00:01:19.630> frequency<00:01:20.109> drivers

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
impact out of the low frequency drivers

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:24.629 
impact out of the low frequency drivers
so<00:01:21.189> kind<00:01:21.999> of<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.179> neat<00:01:22.359> acoustic<00:01:22.959> design<00:01:23.289> to<00:01:23.889> get

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
so kind of a neat acoustic design to get

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:28.440 
so kind of a neat acoustic design to get
a<00:01:24.700> really<00:01:25.319> effective<00:01:26.319> and<00:01:27.450> non-interfering

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
a really effective and non-interfering

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.209 
a really effective and non-interfering
low<00:01:28.810> frequency<00:01:29.770> response

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
low frequency response

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.629 
low frequency response
another<00:01:31.029> unique<00:01:31.420> trait<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:31.840> 8:46<00:01:32.920> would<00:01:33.490> be

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:33.639 
another unique trait of 8:46 would be

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:35.370 
another unique trait of 8:46 would be
the<00:01:33.789> adjustable<00:01:34.270> high<00:01:34.420> frequency<00:01:34.990> filters

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
the adjustable high frequency filters

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.440 
the adjustable high frequency filters
that<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.679> can<00:01:35.770> put<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.310> nozzle<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:36.880> it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
that you can put in a nozzle here it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.389 
that you can put in a nozzle here it
comes<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:37.719> this<00:01:37.869> little<00:01:37.929> tool<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:39.069> you<00:01:39.130> can

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
comes with this little tool so you can

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.949 
comes with this little tool so you can
take<00:01:39.579> off<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.759> metal<00:01:40.060> ring<00:01:40.329> and<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.689> metal

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
take off the metal ring and the metal

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.019 
take off the metal ring and the metal
nozzle<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.590> then<00:01:41.740> inside<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.249> will<00:01:42.700> insert

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
nozzle and then inside you will insert

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:44.999 
nozzle and then inside you will insert
these<00:01:43.240> little<00:01:43.509> plastic<00:01:43.990> filters<00:01:44.619> there's

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
these little plastic filters there's

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.789 
these little plastic filters there's
three<00:01:45.340> different<00:01:45.490> styles<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:47.229> neutral<00:01:47.619> one

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
three different styles the neutral one

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.239 
three different styles the neutral one
which<00:01:48.369> says<00:01:49.270> basic<00:01:50.170> overall<00:01:50.619> kind<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.009> flat

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
which says basic overall kind of flat

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.179 
which says basic overall kind of flat
sound<00:01:51.549> there<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.689> also<00:01:52.959> a<00:01:53.170> brightness<00:01:53.859> boost

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
sound there is also a brightness boost

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.199 
sound there is also a brightness boost
one<00:01:54.490> which<00:01:55.060> boosts<00:01:55.450> from<00:01:55.719> one<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.229> eight<00:01:56.439> K<00:01:57.209> so

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
one which boosts from one to eight K so

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.120 
one which boosts from one to eight K so
kind<00:01:58.599> of<00:01:58.659> a<00:01:58.749> high<00:01:58.899> mid<00:01:59.169> boost<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.740> presence

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
kind of a high mid boost in the presence

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.169 
kind of a high mid boost in the presence
region<00:02:00.549> area<00:02:01.169> and<00:02:02.169> then<00:02:02.409> also<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:03.159> high<00:02:03.459> cut<00:02:03.880> or

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
region area and then also a high cut or

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.909 
region area and then also a high cut or
a<00:02:04.209> warmer<00:02:04.630> sounding<00:02:04.990> one<00:02:05.169> which<00:02:05.380> will<00:02:05.619> cut

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:05.919 
a warmer sounding one which will cut

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:09.690 
a warmer sounding one which will cut
right<00:02:06.249> in<00:02:06.429> that<00:02:06.549> same<00:02:06.819> 1k<00:02:07.359> 2k<00:02:07.509> region<00:02:08.459> by<00:02:09.459> about

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
right in that same 1k 2k region by about

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
right in that same 1k 2k region by about
2<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.060> 3<00:02:10.239> dB<00:02:10.599> I<00:02:10.869> think<00:02:11.260> ultimately<00:02:11.739> I<00:02:12.010> was

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
2 to 3 dB I think ultimately I was

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920 
2 to 3 dB I think ultimately I was
happiest<00:02:12.670> with<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.180> neutral<00:02:13.569> filter

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
happiest with the neutral filter

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.070 
happiest with the neutral filter
although<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:14.860> times<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> ninja

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
although at times with the ninja

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.900 
although at times with the ninja
I<00:02:16.110> felt<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.100> could<00:02:17.250> use<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> little<00:02:17.700> more

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I felt like I could use a little more

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.810 
I felt like I could use a little more
brightness<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.890> brighter<00:02:20.160> filter<00:02:20.520> didn't

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
brightness the brighter filter didn't

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
brightness the brighter filter didn't
really<00:02:21.060> help<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.690> for<00:02:21.900> me<00:02:22.080> because<00:02:22.260> I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
really help that out for me because I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.380 
really help that out for me because I
was<00:02:23.400> kind<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.610> hoping<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.120> little<00:02:24.270> more

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
was kind of hoping for a little more

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.110 
was kind of hoping for a little more
super<00:02:25.230> kind<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.710> upper<00:02:25.920> frequency<00:02:26.400> airiness

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
super kind of upper frequency airiness

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.680 
super kind of upper frequency airiness
or<00:02:27.330> brightness<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.210> high<00:02:30.210> frequency

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
or brightness and the high frequency

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.000 
or brightness and the high frequency
filters<00:02:31.050> boost<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.770> kind<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.550> presence<00:02:32.910> region

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
filters boost in kind of presence region

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.110 
filters boost in kind of presence region
so<00:02:35.010> anyway<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.490> kind<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.910> like<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
so anyway I just kind of like the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.600 
so anyway I just kind of like the
neutral<00:02:36.420> filter<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> most<00:02:37.610> overall

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
neutral filter the most overall

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.400 
neutral filter the most overall
sonically<00:02:39.300> these<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.260> interesting

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
sonically these are kind of interesting

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.800 
sonically these are kind of interesting
I<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:41.940> are<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> pretty<00:02:42.210> nice<00:02:42.420> sound<00:02:42.690> in

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
I think there are a pretty nice sound in

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
I think there are a pretty nice sound in
your<00:02:42.930> phone<00:02:43.230> they're<00:02:43.590> definitely<00:02:43.890> aggressive

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
your phone they're definitely aggressive

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.690 
your phone they're definitely aggressive
in<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.940> base<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.980> if<00:02:47.070> you're<00:02:47.190> somebody<00:02:47.340> likes

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
in the base so if you're somebody likes

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.340 
in the base so if you're somebody likes
a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:47.910> more<00:02:48.150> neutral<00:02:48.510> sound<00:02:48.810> these<00:02:49.110> might

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
a little more neutral sound these might

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.740 
a little more neutral sound these might
be<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> little<00:02:49.890> bit<00:02:50.010> aggressive<00:02:50.210> in<00:02:51.210> low-end

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
be a little bit aggressive in low-end

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.620 
be a little bit aggressive in low-end
but<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.740> pretty<00:02:52.890> fun<00:02:53.160> bass<00:02:53.370> response<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:54.180> do

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
but it's a pretty fun bass response I do

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.720 
but it's a pretty fun bass response I do
feel<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:54.930> sometimes<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.310> little

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
feel like sometimes it can be a little

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.800 
feel like sometimes it can be a little
overly<00:02:57.360> strong<00:02:59.150> but<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.240> really<00:03:00.390> gives<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
overly strong but it really gives you a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.320 
overly strong but it really gives you a
true<00:03:01.200> kind<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> sub<00:03:01.890> woofer<00:03:02.250> type<00:03:02.760> sound<00:03:03.090> which

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
true kind of sub woofer type sound which

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.550 
true kind of sub woofer type sound which
is<00:03:03.390> what<00:03:03.570> they<00:03:03.660> were<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:03.959> trying<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.380> go

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
is what they were really trying to go

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.699 
is what they were really trying to go
for<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.490> design<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.440> sometimes<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.590> could

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
for in this design so sometimes it could

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.650 
for in this design so sometimes it could
use<00:03:07.890> maybe<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.190> little<00:03:08.400> more<00:03:08.580> articulation<00:03:09.420> in

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
use maybe a little more articulation in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.650 
use maybe a little more articulation in
the<00:03:10.230> bass<00:03:10.380> response<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:11.130> overall<00:03:11.820> very<00:03:12.000> fun

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the bass response but overall very fun

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.900 
the bass response but overall very fun
if<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.560> listen<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.830> rock<00:03:14.100> or<00:03:14.400> metal<00:03:14.580> or

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
if you listen to rock or metal or

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.610 
if you listen to rock or metal or
hip-hop<00:03:15.200> totally<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.590> that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
hip-hop totally going to like that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.380 
hip-hop totally going to like that
low-end<00:03:17.160> response<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.820> was<00:03:17.970> having<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.240> lot<00:03:18.330> of

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
low-end response I was having a lot of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.940 
low-end response I was having a lot of
fun<00:03:18.600> with<00:03:18.840> metal<00:03:19.260> on<00:03:19.380> nice<00:03:19.590> bones<00:03:21.950> getting

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
fun with metal on nice bones getting

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.560 
fun with metal on nice bones getting
into<00:03:23.280> little<00:03:23.700> more<00:03:23.820> pristine<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.510> of

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
into little more pristine kind of

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.900 
into little more pristine kind of
recordings<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.590> could<00:03:26.130> maybe<00:03:26.400> use<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> little

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
recordings I could maybe use a little

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.870 
recordings I could maybe use a little
more<00:03:27.420> air<00:03:27.720> out<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.739> shores<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
more air out of the shores in the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.210 
more air out of the shores in the
uppermost<00:03:30.300> frequencies<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:31.440> overall

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
uppermost frequencies but overall

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.640 
uppermost frequencies but overall
they're<00:03:32.550> pretty<00:03:32.820> inviting<00:03:33.209> your<00:03:33.780> phone<00:03:34.050> kind

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
they're pretty inviting your phone kind

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.680 
they're pretty inviting your phone kind
of<00:03:34.709> remind<00:03:35.010> me<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.370> 650s<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.120> little<00:03:36.330> bit<00:03:36.480> in

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
of remind me of the 650s a little bit in

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.220 
of remind me of the 650s a little bit in
a<00:03:36.780> way<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.170> Sennheiser's<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.060> warm<00:03:39.390> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
a way the Sennheiser's just a warm you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.810 
a way the Sennheiser's just a warm you

know inviting sound that's not going to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.430 
know inviting sound that's not going to
totally<00:03:42.090> beat<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.300> up<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.959> high<00:03:43.170> frequency

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
totally beat you up in a high frequency

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.120 
totally beat you up in a high frequency
range<00:03:44.360> compared<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.950> Sennheiser's<00:03:46.950> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
range compared to the Sennheiser's the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.060 
range compared to the Sennheiser's the
ID<00:03:47.280> 800<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.720> other<00:03:49.140> high-end<00:03:49.440> ear<00:03:49.769> canals

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
ID 800 the other high-end ear canals

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.620 
ID 800 the other high-end ear canals
that<00:03:50.220> are<00:03:50.370> out<00:03:50.489> at<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.670> moment<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:51.180> think<00:03:51.390> these

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
that are out at the moment I think these

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.150 
that are out at the moment I think these
are<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.810> little<00:03:51.989> nicer<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:52.890> upper

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
are a little nicer in that upper

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.710 
are a little nicer in that upper
frequency<00:03:53.610> range<00:03:53.850> although<00:03:54.330> they<00:03:54.540> don't

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
frequency range although they don't

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.280 
frequency range although they don't
sound<00:03:54.900> quite<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.290> detailed<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.310> kind<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.670> Airy

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
sound quite as detailed and kind of Airy

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.449 
sound quite as detailed and kind of Airy
they're<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.500> little<00:03:58.590> easier<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.160> listen

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
they're just a little easier to listen

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.570 
they're just a little easier to listen
to<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.910> unless<00:04:00.300> you're<00:04:00.510> taking<00:04:00.810> over<00:04:01.050> nothing

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
to and unless you're taking over nothing

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.520 
to and unless you're taking over nothing
so<00:04:02.580> ultimately<00:04:02.820> this<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.750> best<00:04:04.080> earphone

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
so ultimately this is the best earphone

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.630 
so ultimately this is the best earphone
atures<00:04:04.860> ever<00:04:05.100> produced

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
atures ever produced

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.259 
atures ever produced
I<00:04:05.700> definitely<00:04:05.940> think<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:07.800> much<00:04:08.400> nicer<00:04:08.640> kind<00:04:09.209> of

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
I definitely think a much nicer kind of

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.940 
I definitely think a much nicer kind of
upper<00:04:09.480> frequency<00:04:09.930> tone<00:04:10.260> than<00:04:10.590> some<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:10.890> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
upper frequency tone than some of the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.600 
upper frequency tone than some of the
other<00:04:11.100> Shores

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
other Shores

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.280 
other Shores
I<00:04:11.820> just<00:04:12.360> get<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> little<00:04:12.720> more<00:04:12.840> natural

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
I just get a little more natural

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.050 
I just get a little more natural
character<00:04:13.709> out<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.890> these<00:04:14.070> much<00:04:14.700> more<00:04:14.730> like<00:04:15.030> a

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
character out of these much more like a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.469 
character out of these much more like a
full<00:04:15.299> sized<00:04:15.510> phone<00:04:16.970> definitely<00:04:17.970> expect<00:04:18.359> a

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
full sized phone definitely expect a

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.110 
full sized phone definitely expect a
serious<00:04:18.660> bass<00:04:19.049> response<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:20.489> price<00:04:20.729> point<00:04:21.030> on

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
serious bass response the price point on

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.590 
serious bass response the price point on
these

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
these

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.420 
these
is<00:04:21.830> 995<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.640> right<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.000> there<00:04:24.150> are<00:04:24.240> $1,000<00:04:25.430> but

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
is 995 so right up there are $1,000 but

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.800 
is 995 so right up there are $1,000 but
these<00:04:26.670> are<00:04:26.820> definitely<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.330> good<00:04:27.420> one<00:04:27.690> to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
these are definitely a good one to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.780 
these are definitely a good one to
consider<00:04:28.230> in<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.650> higher<00:04:28.890> price<00:04:29.250> range<00:04:29.400> if

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
consider in that higher price range if

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.700 
consider in that higher price range if
you<00:04:30.180> don't<00:04:30.360> want<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.570> go<00:04:30.660> with<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.870> custom<00:04:31.260> I

you don't want to go with a custom I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.950 
you don't want to go with a custom I

shares but they've got a lot of stuff
packed<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.370> here<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:20.730> that's<00:05:20.880> understandable

packed in here so that's understandable

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.770
