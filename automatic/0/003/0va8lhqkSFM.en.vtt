 cover the fork of the facebow with 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.680
 record materials in my solid of 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.680
 vinyl police yes healthy 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 take the fork to the mouth of the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.870
 patient and orient the bolt to the line 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.820
 half 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.520
 orient the olives of the arms 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.500
 laterals in the auditory canals one 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.080
 at the same time and allow the elastic 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.690
 close the arch to guide the 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.550
 second olive introduce the joint 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.790
 on the fork pin to the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.790
 background 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.190
 place the nation council on the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.289
 patient's falometric point 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 tighten the knobs on the arms 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.469
 lateral 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.180
 tighten the articulation rods 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.180
 so is 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.430
 check the position of the articulator and 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.430
 arc 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.980
 To remove the face bow, retract the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.910
 bolt of the nation by loosening the knob 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.910
 correspondent 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.550
 Remove the centric spring to 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.290
 separate the articulator branches and 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.180
 raise the incised stem until the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.550
 top end so that the branch 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 top is tilted on the table 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.180
 of work 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.009
 remove the arch nation attachment 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 facial connect the bow introducing 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.890
 the connection bolts to the cavities 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.890
 of the olives 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.149
 close the upper branch over the arch and 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.149
 place them on the lower branch 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.650
 open the upper branch again and with 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.170
 what the connected elements on the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.819
 work table with what the model 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.099
 superior on the record of the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.230
 hairpin and facial bow and press 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.530
 gently to achieve its correct 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.019
 settlement mix plaster assembly and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.650
 deposit on the mounting plate and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.650
 the model 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.120
 Close the branch again on the arch 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 and place the envelope on the lower branch I left 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.370
 set the plaster 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.860
 once hardened the plaster separates the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.069
 branch of the facial bow and with slight force 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.069
 detach the connection slide the stem 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:05.140
 incise and adjust the graduation to the type of 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.140
 mount that you have selected 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.770
 invert the upper branch of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.980
 articulator and place the record of 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.980
 occlusion 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.230
 place on the registration of the model 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.080
 lower and moderate compression doing 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.300
 the models to the record this maneuver is 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.850
 the most delicate of the process and its 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.760
 Correct handling guarantees you the 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.070
 success in the procedure sustain the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.070
 models and the record with an elastic 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.209
 Mix mounting plaster and deposit what 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.209
 on the stage and the lower model 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.920
 verify the concentric location of the 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.920
 lower branch 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.020
 cut the elastic with scissors 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.420
 remove the occlusion register elevate or 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.310
 remove the stem and sisal and its assembly 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.940
 is ready for analysis 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.940
