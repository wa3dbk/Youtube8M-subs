so<00:03:04.780> I'm<00:03:04.870> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> add<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:05.680> ground<00:03:06.340> paste<00:03:06.579> a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
so I'm going to add this ground paste a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.110 
so I'm going to add this ground paste a
little<00:03:07.090> more<00:03:07.209> water<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:08.579> just<00:03:09.579> add<00:03:09.850> this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
little more water to this just add this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.479 
little more water to this just add this
water<00:03:10.450> also<00:03:12.870> solidity<00:03:13.870> at<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.530> consistency

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
water also solidity at this consistency

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.509 
water also solidity at this consistency
now<00:03:15.730> because<00:03:16.660> once<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.170> boils<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.950> will<00:03:18.190> become

now because once it boils it will become

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.569 
now because once it boils it will become
thick<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:19.209> if<00:03:19.510> needed<00:03:19.810> then<00:03:20.590> we<00:03:21.250> will<00:03:21.400> add
