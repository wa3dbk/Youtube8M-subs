00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi everyone rai music to the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.950
 yawns and today we are left 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.490
 for the discovery of a cat 12w 38 a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.410
 so let's go 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.449
 the first change that had in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.070
 the snack jadu w 38 ha and that now 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.470
 place the pieces of wood the logs 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.269
 is easier then when you cliff 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 right click on the ground without 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 click a block the side of a block the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.860
 log of wood will be placed like those 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.230
 this as before even if you place it 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.960
 when you are on the side then that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.719
 facilitates the construction of two 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 buildings think that when you arrive 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.489
 and you place a log of wood on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 the side of a block 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.170
 what's going to happen is that and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 wants to get two sides so that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.870
 really facilitates the creation of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.550
 structures and construction in general 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.250
 it will take a day that people tchemo 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 jong would decide the appearance of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 big block n because right now the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.150
 tag have again changed texture 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 so there was the return of the little ones 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.259
 blue patterns on the outline of the block 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.450
 as in snapshot 12w 32 years 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.750
 except that now via the plate and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.509
 from the west to the bottom but there are no 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.400
 cubes in the middle that turns and the spoke has 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.280
 been changed too we should a little bit of the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.380
 lace or something 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.710
 a new style monster appeared 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.909
 in minecraft and it's a witch 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 so now we can not 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.970
 find in the game but you can 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.530
 see that there is a little animation at 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.350
 level of his nose rising and who 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.950
 goes down oddly with a pustule on 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.939
 the end of the nose 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.250
 so do not flash it 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.670
 angry because when we hit her 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.830
 what do they want 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.659
 photo will be well that they return in 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.420
 his enclosure going back to thank you so I 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.429
 will change my game mode but we will 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.120
 see what is it that makes us so 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.610
 moment she is not able to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.900
 to appear naturally we owe it 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.180
 shape appears with an egg 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.930
 except when it crosses you account 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:28.430
 and you throw potions then the g 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.560
 the poison effect and lsd and launches 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.560
 potions of slow damage 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 instant as I just received 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.630
 and poisons then is really 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.590
 dangerous you see at death ok 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.600
 wicked witch my songs 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.390
 webb tried to kill me again yes these 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.200
 trades again i'm going back in 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.370
 your juice mode for perfect pokemon 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.799
 and yes not here you can see that you 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 can make it appear with an egg 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.220
 of witch witches that you are 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.320
 find in your creative inventory a 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.359
 other new mob appeared in a 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.329
 cellar so and this time it's a mob 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.810
 harmless it's a bat so 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.100
 bats can be can 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.829
 appear naturally what you 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.000
 make a witch appear so the 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.820
 witch makes appear 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.260
 bats just randomly and 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.040
 here the little bat you can 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.450
 finally appear with a 9 9 2 bat whose 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.049
 bats that you find 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.000
 also in the Creative Mode Inventory 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.299
 so if you make it appear in 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.910
 a space where there is no wayne them 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.340
 peoples who is your books everywhere and 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.269
 for now when you're in mode 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.060
 in survival mode it does not attack you 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.950
 no more to the creative world that's for sure 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.680
 then is a completely harmless 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.200
 for now some are two in 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.400
 minecraft were changed so when 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.720
 you are walking on the sand the sound is 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.060
 very different now it looks like 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.060
 we walk almost in the mud 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:19.380
 but hey it's more realistic laroche 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:21.570
 also has been changed and the wood even 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:29.280
 when you place system are 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:32.639
 exchanged 20 years a little squeaks 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:47.690
 as if the boards had cracked the 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:52.800
 Russia and the sand is also the sound of 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.610
 god when walking on grass or 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.710
 good grass 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.380
 the noises has been changed is also 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.000
 when you put the block on the other hand 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.870
 find that noise when placing the 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.580
 block it looks a bit like a rake and I 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.150
 find it weird 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.340
 but the sound of destruction 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.900
 blocks is always the same 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.330
 another effect his name that was changed 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.330
 so it's when you jump in the water 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.260
 it's really a more realistic sound and 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:38.480
 white while as if you were in 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:40.890
 swim I think that a little bit 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.060
 in the heater that persistent noise 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.110
 a little too much but at the same time 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.560
 it's more realistic 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.660
 so if only the new effects 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.530
 sound that was that they were bought 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.530
 at play 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.350
 and yes the discovery of the snap shot is 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.390
 already finished so I was not 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.860
 really a very big snapshot 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.200
 except that I'm sure that in the 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.330
 next piotte the witches are going to have 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.520
 a utility and the bats are going 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.150
 surely be able to do whatever 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.160
 something else 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.350
 maybe when you hard, 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.590
 they will give you experience or 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.480
 well I do not know maybe another 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.100
 object that will be implanted in the game 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.360
 but for now when you kill 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.800
 the shoes and she does not give you 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.610
 nothing they witches either so 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.700
 that's all for today 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.090
 thank you for watching the video and for 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.050
 next 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.050
 bye
