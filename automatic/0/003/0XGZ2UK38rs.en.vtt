intimidating or overwhelming or both but
this<00:00:52.490> is<00:00:52.640> about<00:00:52.880> letting<00:00:53.390> go<00:00:53.630> of<00:00:53.660> your<00:00:53.870> fear

while<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.310> was<00:00:59.580> painting<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.150> I<00:01:00.330> was<00:01:00.570> thinking

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
while I was painting this I was thinking

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.320 
while I was painting this I was thinking
just<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.500> much<00:01:01.680> about<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.400> negative<00:01:02.790> space<00:01:03.060> as

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
just as much about the negative space as

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.140 
just as much about the negative space as
I<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:04.800> space<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.460> painting<00:01:05.940> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I was the space that I was painting and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
I was the space that I was painting and
that's<00:01:06.300> because<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.260> negative<00:01:07.590> space<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's because the negative space is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.500 
that's because the negative space is
part<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.730> what<00:01:08.880> makes<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> whole

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
part of what makes up the whole

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690 
part of what makes up the whole
composition<00:01:09.950> every<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.160> I<00:01:11.190> use<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> new

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
composition every time I use a new

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.660 
composition every time I use a new
material<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.480> end<00:01:12.870> up<00:01:13.110> making<00:01:13.470> lots<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.310> little

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
material I end up making lots of little

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
material I end up making lots of little
mistakes<00:01:15.420> although<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.010> say<00:01:17.190> when

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
mistakes although I like to say when

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
perfect that's part of the creative
