pixels<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.590> SSRS<00:00:17.039> me<00:00:17.310> getting<00:00:17.520> confused<00:00:17.820> so

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
pixels in SSRS me getting confused so

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960 
pixels in SSRS me getting confused so
the<00:00:18.600> pen<00:00:18.779> tool<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.520> on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> left<00:00:20.820> hand

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the pen tool is up here on the left hand

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.429 
the pen tool is up here on the left hand
side<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.779> press<00:00:21.900> p<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.289> your

keyboard to select this and why you
would<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.960> use<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.529> basically<00:00:25.949> for

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
would want to use this is basically for

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.259 
would want to use this is basically for
really<00:00:26.519> smooth<00:00:26.849> perfect<00:00:27.300> lines<00:00:28.820> eat<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
really smooth perfect lines eat just

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.580 
really smooth perfect lines eat just
lines<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.660> can't<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.289> by<00:00:31.320> using

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
lines that you can't get just by using

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.090 
lines that you can't get just by using
the<00:00:31.920> brush<00:00:32.070> tool<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.750> example<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.649> have

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the brush tool so in this example I have

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950 
the brush tool so in this example I have
some<00:00:35.520> some<00:00:36.210> rough<00:00:36.360> outlines<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
some some rough outlines in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
some some rough outlines in the
background<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> show<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
background I'm going to show you how I

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.690 
background I'm going to show you how I
use<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> pen<00:00:40.500> tool<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.890> create<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.370> part<00:00:41.610> of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
use the pen tool to create this part of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
use the pen tool to create this part of
the<00:00:41.790> blade<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> make<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.930> smooth

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the blade here and make it really smooth

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.770 
the blade here and make it really smooth
line<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> let's<00:00:44.879> start<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.300> by<00:00:45.420> creating<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
line so let's start off by creating a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.600 
line so let's start off by creating a
new<00:00:45.960> layer<00:00:46.910> layer<00:00:47.910> 27<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
new layer layer 27 right I'm going to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
new layer layer 27 right I'm going to
zoom<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.210> bit<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.829> just<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
zoom in a little bit for this just so I

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.090 
zoom in a little bit for this just so I
get<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.610> accurate<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
get it a little bit more accurate so you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.020 
get it a little bit more accurate so you
would<00:00:56.219> click<00:00:56.930> wherever<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> start

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
would click wherever you want to start

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.229 
would click wherever you want to start
and<00:01:00.140> click<00:01:01.140> again<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> next<00:01:01.770> point<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.969> do

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and click again at the next point but do

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.050 
and click again at the next point but do
not<00:01:03.539> let<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.559> let<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.949> you've<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
not let go if you let go you've got a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660 
not let go if you let go you've got a
straight<00:01:06.299> line<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> carry<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.670> but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
straight line and carry on like that but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
straight line and carry on like that but
this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> why<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> pen<00:01:10.229> tool<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.560> great

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this is why the pen tool is great

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.630 
this is why the pen tool is great
because<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.220> click<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.939> keep<00:01:12.210> old<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
because you can click and keep old and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
because you can click and keep old and
then<00:01:15.140> adjust<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:18.530> I'm<00:01:19.530> going

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
then adjust it to how you want I'm going

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.870 
then adjust it to how you want I'm going
to<00:01:19.799> redo<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.610> wasn't

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
to redo that one because that wasn't

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
to redo that one because that wasn't
particularly<00:01:21.330> great<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:22.409> hopefully<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> can

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
particularly great but hopefully you can

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.469 
particularly great but hopefully you can
see<00:01:25.460> how<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.790> use<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.390> tool<00:01:29.299> now<00:01:30.299> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
see how you can use this tool now this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.890 
see how you can use this tool now this
is<00:01:30.540> important<00:01:31.130> once<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.610> point

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
is important once you go to this point

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.219 
is important once you go to this point
hold<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.680> Alt<00:01:34.979> key<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.020> select<00:01:37.020> this

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
hold down the Alt key and select this

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.130 
hold down the Alt key and select this
edge<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.430> drag<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:38.970> into<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.720> midpoint

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
edge and drag it right into the midpoint

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
edge and drag it right into the midpoint
this<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.100> sure<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.400> don't<00:01:41.430> mess<00:01:41.820> up

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this just make sure you don't mess up

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.740 
this just make sure you don't mess up
your<00:01:42.150> next<00:01:42.390> line<00:01:43.790> again<00:01:44.790> sim<00:01:45.570> again<00:01:47.750> let's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
your next line again sim again let's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
your next line again sim again let's
create<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> blog<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
create a blog like that I'm going to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.160 
create a blog like that I'm going to
move<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.060> slightly<00:01:51.390> actually<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.020> hold

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
move this slightly actually you can hold

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.819 
move this slightly actually you can hold
down<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.500> control<00:01:52.920> key<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:54.380> select<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
down the control key and select that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.030 
down the control key and select that
point<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> move<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
point and move it so it

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.010 
point and move it so it
there<00:02:01.200> again<00:02:02.200> holding<00:02:02.950> alt<00:02:03.510> drag<00:02:04.510> this<00:02:04.780> one

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
there again holding alt drag this one

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.859 
there again holding alt drag this one
down<00:02:08.100> I'm<00:02:09.100> going<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.340> turn<00:02:09.550> my<00:02:09.820> layer<00:02:10.420> off<00:02:10.630> for

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
down I'm going to turn my layer off for

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.210

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
lock transparent pixels and I've used

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.040 
lock transparent pixels and I've used
that<00:04:26.410> on<00:04:26.650> this<00:04:26.800> piece<00:04:27.070> for<00:04:27.370> example<00:04:27.880> with<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
that on this piece for example with the

that on this piece for example with the
hair<00:04:29.380> up<00:04:29.620> here<00:04:29.890> probably<00:04:30.640> tell<00:04:30.880> not<00:04:31.090> everybody

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
hair up here probably tell not everybody

wants<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.780> smooth<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.350> line<00:04:32.590> if<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.430> used<00:04:33.700> it

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
wants that smooth the line if I used it

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.370 
wants that smooth the line if I used it
for<00:04:34.060> most<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.630> year<00:04:34.690> for<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.020> outline<00:04:35.320> of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
for most of this year for the outline of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.890 
for most of this year for the outline of
the<00:04:35.470> body<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:36.240> because<00:04:37.240> I'm<00:04:37.390> terrible<00:04:37.780> at

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
the body and because I'm terrible at

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.300 
the body and because I'm terrible at
getting<00:04:38.110> smooth<00:04:38.410> lines<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:38.920> drawing<00:04:39.220> them

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
getting smooth lines just drawing them

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.890 
getting smooth lines just drawing them
and<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.880> don't<00:04:40.060> think<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.480> get<00:04:40.660> them<00:04:40.780> as

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
and I don't think you can get them as

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.660 
and I don't think you can get them as
smooth<00:04:41.140> as<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.470> unless<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.160> use<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.520> pen

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
smooth as that unless you use the pen

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.480 
smooth as that unless you use the pen
