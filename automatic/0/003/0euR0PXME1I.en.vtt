using the costume for my tutorial videos
was<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> hard<00:04:10.140> decision<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.620> make<00:04:10.739> because<00:04:11.340> any

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
got a lot more views than any other

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.599 
got a lot more views than any other
video<00:04:17.850> my<00:04:18.299> first<00:04:18.570> parkour<00:04:19.230> tutorial<00:04:19.830> as<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
video my first parkour tutorial as the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.219 
video my first parkour tutorial as the
Assassin's<00:04:21.120> Creed<00:04:21.330> character<00:04:21.750> which<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:21.960> how

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
Assassin's Creed character which is how

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.440 
Assassin's Creed character which is how
to<00:04:22.289> get<00:04:22.500> started<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:23.010> parkour<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:24.000> now<00:04:24.150> over<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
to get started in parkour is now over a

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.030 
to get started in parkour is now over a
million

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
million

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.330 
million
use<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:27.470> was<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:27.740> tempting<00:04:28.250> to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
use and so it was really tempting to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.920 
use and so it was really tempting to
keep<00:04:28.550> doing<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.150> way<00:04:29.210> just<00:04:29.660> for<00:04:29.810> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
keep doing it that way just for the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.200 
keep doing it that way just for the
views<00:04:30.260> but<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:30.890> realized<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.400> shouldn't<00:04:31.790> just<00:04:32.030> be

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
views but I realized I shouldn't just be

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.360 
views but I realized I shouldn't just be
doing<00:04:32.540> something<00:04:32.990> for<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.320> views<00:04:33.620> because<00:04:34.340> a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
doing something for the views because a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.950 
doing something for the views because a
part<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.880> reason<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.300> do<00:04:35.360> my<00:04:35.600> YouTube

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
up and blind me and everything I did now

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.750

not<00:05:49.760> everyone<00:05:50.240> would<00:05:50.390> know<00:05:50.630> that<00:05:50.660> but<00:05:51.320> just

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
not everyone would know that but just

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.670 
not everyone would know that but just
almost<00:05:52.760> knowing<00:05:53.420> that<00:05:53.600> I<00:05:53.750> can<00:05:54.050> do<00:05:54.230> all<00:05:54.410> those

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
almost knowing that I can do all those

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.920 
almost knowing that I can do all those
same<00:05:54.950> tricks<00:05:55.340> in<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.820> type<00:05:56.030> of<00:05:56.060> costume<00:05:56.780> I

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
same tricks in that type of costume I

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.420 
same tricks in that type of costume I
would<00:05:57.170> hope<00:05:57.350> would<00:05:57.560> help<00:05:57.830> improve<00:05:59.110> the

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
would hope would help improve the

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.790 
would hope would help improve the
potential<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.760> receive<00:06:02.150> job<00:06:03.080> opportunities

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
potential to receive job opportunities

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.470 
potential to receive job opportunities
for<00:06:03.980> stunt<00:06:04.280> work<00:06:04.460> because<00:06:04.820> if<00:06:04.970> they<00:06:05.120> see<00:06:05.180> that

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
for stunt work because if they see that

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.330 
for stunt work because if they see that
and<00:06:05.900> go<00:06:05.960> hey<00:06:06.290> he<00:06:06.530> can<00:06:06.740> do<00:06:06.860> that<00:06:07.010> in<00:06:07.190> that

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
and go hey he can do that in that

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.490 
and go hey he can do that in that
costume<00:06:07.670> that<00:06:08.510> I<00:06:08.600> bet<00:06:08.780> he<00:06:08.870> can<00:06:09.080> do<00:06:09.200> it<00:06:09.290> in<00:06:09.380> this

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
costume that I bet he can do it in this

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.290 
costume that I bet he can do it in this
other<00:06:09.710> crazy<00:06:10.010> costume<00:06:10.610> we<00:06:10.730> need<00:06:10.910> for<00:06:11.150> this

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
for that reason but I understand that

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.990 
for that reason but I understand that
you're<00:06:36.990> not<00:06:37.169> really<00:06:37.410> into<00:06:37.770> parkour<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:38.490> are

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
you're not really into parkour and are

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.680
