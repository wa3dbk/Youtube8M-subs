interface<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.509> telemetry<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.859> had<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
interface on telemetry now we had a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.069 
interface on telemetry now we had a
mount<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.669> past<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.269> basically<00:00:30.720> came<00:00:31.019> up

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
mount in the past that basically came up

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.590 
mount in the past that basically came up
similar<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.009> style<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.970> but<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
similar in style right here but had a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
similar in style right here but had a
bridge<00:00:33.900> across<00:00:34.080> the<00:00:34.290> bottom<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> quarter

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
have a quarter by 20 mount on them so

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.770 
have a quarter by 20 mount on them so
you<00:00:43.080> had<00:00:43.200> no<00:00:43.350> real<00:00:43.590> way<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> fix<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.060> without

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you had no real way to fix a without

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
you had no real way to fix a without
doing<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.500> DIY<00:00:46.650> part<00:00:47.160> project<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
doing it some kind of DIY part project a

so let me go ahead and go over some of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
so let me go ahead and go over some of
the<00:00:52.920> features<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> has<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> slight

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.069 
the back of this you've got quite a few
options<00:01:17.579> there<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.479> tilt<00:01:18.689> angle

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
options there to get the tilt angle

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.380 
options there to get the tilt angle
forward<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.679> in<00:01:20.189> front<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.030> antenna

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
forward and in front of the antenna

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.419 
forward and in front of the antenna
itself<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.020> you've<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.319> full<00:01:22.619> reception<00:01:23.039> out

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
itself so you've got full reception out

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.010 
itself so you've got full reception out
coming<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.149> your<00:01:24.420> antenna<00:01:24.719> so<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:24.960> not

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
coming from your antenna so you're not

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
coming from your antenna so you're not
gonna<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.319> any<00:01:25.469> issues<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:26.069> as<00:01:26.249> well

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
gonna have any issues there as well

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.209 
gonna have any issues there as well
another<00:01:27.780> cool<00:01:27.990> feature<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.679> is<00:01:28.859> it<00:01:29.069> just

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
another cool feature about it is it just

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.639 
another cool feature about it is it just
has<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.640> adjustment<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.359> so<00:01:30.810> while<00:01:30.990> you're

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
has the adjustment here so while you're

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:32.809 
has the adjustment here so while you're
holding<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.249> you're<00:01:32.340> looking<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.670> at

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
holding it and you're looking down at

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.520 
holding it and you're looking down at
your<00:01:33.479> telemetry<00:01:33.929> you're<00:01:34.170> hearing<00:01:34.439> your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
your telemetry you're hearing your

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.899 
your telemetry you're hearing your
feedback<00:01:34.679> on<00:01:35.069> that<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.490> adjust<00:01:35.609> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
feedback on that you can adjust the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.090 
feedback on that you can adjust the
angle<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.929> for<00:01:37.170> Sun<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.619> anything<00:01:37.859> like

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
angle you know for Sun or anything like

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.459 
angle you know for Sun or anything like
that<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.149> as<00:01:39.420> well<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.079> anyway<00:01:40.289> I<00:01:40.319> guess

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
that from that as well so anyway I guess

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:41.840 
that from that as well so anyway I guess
it's<00:01:40.649> pretty<00:01:40.889> simple<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.429> mean<00:01:41.579> there's<00:01:41.729> not

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's pretty simple I mean there's not

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
it's pretty simple I mean there's not
much<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.329> it'll<00:01:42.630> clamp<00:01:42.869> onto<00:01:43.079> any

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
much to it it'll clamp onto any

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
much to it it'll clamp onto any
transmitter<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.429> bar<00:01:44.759> style<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
transmitter that has a bar style on the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.389 
transmitter that has a bar style on the
back<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.109> it<00:01:46.409> allows<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.159> put

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
back of it and it allows you to just put

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.029 
back of it and it allows you to just put
a<00:01:47.429> monitor<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.469> smaller<00:01:49.469> phone<00:01:49.829> or

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
a monitor or a smaller phone or

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.669 
a monitor or a smaller phone or
something<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.929> need<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.469> on

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
something that you need right here on

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.370 
something that you need right here on
your<00:01:52.889> transfer<00:01:53.219> itself<00:01:53.609> super<00:01:54.569> Knights<00:01:54.749> light

the<00:02:00.929> arms<00:02:01.229> themselves<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.369> pretty

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
the arms themselves so it's pretty

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.519 
the arms themselves so it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.270> much<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.289> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
this one I've actually relocated my

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.920 
this one I've actually relocated my
antenna<00:02:21.920> that's<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.430> little<00:02:22.640> DIY<00:02:22.790> did<00:02:23.330> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
antenna that's just a little DIY did and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.590 
antenna that's just a little DIY did and
it<00:02:24.650> also<00:02:24.800> includes<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.520> transmitter<00:02:26.180> standing

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
it also includes a transmitter standing

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.090 
it also includes a transmitter standing
board<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:26.930> well<00:02:27.110> because<00:02:27.650> yeah<00:02:27.800> I've<00:02:27.860> got<00:02:28.010> an

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
board as well because yeah I've got an

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.800 
board as well because yeah I've got an
iPhone<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.300> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
iPhone on this one so you can see that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.900 
iPhone on this one so you can see that
it<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:29.990> definitely<00:02:30.680> collapses<00:02:31.190> down<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.550> echo

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
it is definitely collapses down and echo

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.140 
it is definitely collapses down and echo
go<00:02:32.330> pretty<00:02:32.630> small<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.610> super<00:02:34.610> secure<00:02:35.000> so

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
go pretty small on that super secure so

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
go pretty small on that super secure so
you've<00:02:35.270> got<00:02:35.390> no<00:02:35.570> problems<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you've got no problems with that and it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.420 
you've got no problems with that and it
works<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.130> fine

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
works just fine

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.850 
works just fine
now<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.170> you've<00:02:39.170> still<00:02:39.440> got<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.680> buy<00:02:39.800> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
now the you've still got to buy the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.880 
now the you've still got to buy the
amount<00:02:40.580> itself<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.600> then<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.020> just<00:02:42.770> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
amount itself and then the just the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.410 
amount itself and then the just the
adapter<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.430> gonna<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.670> sold<00:02:43.850> separate<00:02:44.240> if<00:02:44.330> you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
adapter is gonna be sold separate if you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.780 
adapter is gonna be sold separate if you
have<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.570> 9xr<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.410> incorporates<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.520> stand

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
have a 9xr that incorporates the stand

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150 
have a 9xr that incorporates the stand
for<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:47.270> well<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.770> still<00:02:48.980> in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
for that as well this this is still in
