00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.969
 Hello, my dear, welcome 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.519
 on my channel today I want to spend 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.670
 test and try to hide circles 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 blue or green red lipstick 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.029
 I learned about this method quite recently 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.250
 and I want to test this way together 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 with you when this method is not yet 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 tested on yourself so stay 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 with me and let's look together at 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.570
 Well, look at the result, but I â€™m a little bit 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.350
 there was no shadow of itself on the upper eyelid and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.879
 cilia 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.250
 below, I imposed absolutely nothing 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.410
 they concealer powder in no case 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.190
 that's it here so here I left 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.280
 specially place and all get down evil 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.170
 red lipstick 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 matt I don't know how it will be 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 look from some non- matte to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.770
 lipstick and cuff woo and just put 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.159
 a little bit the entrance of the eye that's it for 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.829
 places where there are circles in me is wrong 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.790
 very noticeable but still there are 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:20.280
 that I do not sleep at night 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.090
 so put and now I will shade 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090
 finger 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.590
 that is, I sort of block the circles themselves and 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.979
 I am lipstick skin well, something like this 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 looks now we need to take a 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:45.369
 corrector will be applied over 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.369
 to block red lipstick 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 not very interesting to look at 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:02.149
 result even whether as 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:03.170
 bother i blocked and now i 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.280
 I will use 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:14.330
 Sponzhikom and well try it 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:18.640
 shade here in the camera I see that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.610
 the red pigment looks a little 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.110
 now Iâ€™ll just put a little more 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.440
 corrector and see what of it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.440
 will come out 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.670
 that's all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.010
 I corrected the corrector completely 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.660
 red red lipstick 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.400
 and then advised to apply more 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.380
 foundation on top and let's apply 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.660
 on one side at once powder 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.120
 and on the second side I will try to apply 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.120
 foundation and then in the morning 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.600
 even flashing powder instead of powder I will 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:11.760
 use the base of the Interior Ministry of minerals 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:20.940
 mineral for paradise country only with 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:24.120
 proofreader without tonal well what I want 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.850
 say i finished this test 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.040
 looked at myself in the mirror to know y 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.420
 red lipstick why is she so stated 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.200
 what is red pigment 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.130
 it overlap purple to color and then 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.130
 there is the color of our circles and in fact 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.860
 that's when on the other side where I put 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.530
 tonal basis yet and then on top 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:54.000
 powder seems to me blocked the better than 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.860
 no tonal basis 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.230
 In principle, as such an experiment, yes it is 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.820
 Failed you, in principle, seemed pretty 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.430
 not bad but in my opinion 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.709
 and what I do not like right especially 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.640
 in the summer so sit and bother with 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.030
 make up 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.870
 perfectly covers concealer perfectly 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.700
 It covers just a tone corrector 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.070
 these circles are this 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.970
 a step seems to me superfluous 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.610
 and he is not worth attention until try and 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.140
 just find out what is so new 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.479
 technology is possible but don't know see with 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.640
 Try us if anyone has already tried 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.660
 write me in the comments as you 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.900
 such an experiment is such a novelty 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.120
 and I will be waiting on you and I really want 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.790
 read goodbye to you now 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.660
 thank you all very much for watching guys 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.660
 bye jim
