questions in regards to losing weight if

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.669 
questions in regards to losing weight if
I<00:00:47.899> have<00:00:48.019> loose<00:00:48.319> skin<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.249> um<00:00:49.640> actually<00:00:50.239> I<00:00:50.899> have

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
I have loose skin and um actually I have

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:57.309 
I have loose skin and um actually I have
to<00:00:51.890> say<00:00:52.159> that<00:00:53.109> with<00:00:54.109> my<00:00:54.789> stomach<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:56.359> my<00:00:56.719> inner

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
to say that with my stomach and my inner

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.059

have a day that i can eat whatever I

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.729 
have a day that i can eat whatever I
want<00:04:19.299> I'm<00:04:19.510> still<00:04:19.750> exercise<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.260> day<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:20.590> I'd

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
want I'm still exercise that day as I'd

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.340 
want I'm still exercise that day as I'd
normally<00:04:20.889> do<00:04:21.280> but<00:04:22.120> what<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.720> believe<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.320> that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
normally do but what I believe is that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.920 
normally do but what I believe is that
you<00:04:23.800> can't<00:04:24.160> deprive<00:04:24.669> yourself<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.750> I

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
you can't deprive yourself and and I

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.510 
you can't deprive yourself and and I
just<00:04:26.110> think<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.440> i'll<00:04:26.590> probably<00:04:27.070> get<00:04:27.280> full

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
just think that i'll probably get full

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.340 
just think that i'll probably get full
faster<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.389> i<00:04:28.510> think<00:04:28.870> as<00:04:28.930> long<00:04:29.050> as<00:04:29.229> your

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
faster and i think as long as your

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.900 
faster and i think as long as your
discipline<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:30.010> go<00:04:30.130> right<00:04:30.340> back<00:04:30.490> on<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:30.820> the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
discipline to go right back on it the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.370 
discipline to go right back on it the
next<00:04:31.090> day<00:04:31.270> i<00:04:31.360> think<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.810> going<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.020> be<00:04:32.080> fine

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
next day i think it's going to be fine

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.330 
next day i think it's going to be fine
and<00:04:32.770> i<00:04:33.400> suggested<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.060> only<00:04:34.330> after<00:04:34.990> i<00:04:35.340> was

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
and i suggested that only after i was

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.930 
and i suggested that only after i was
able<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.820> stick<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:37.300> for<00:04:37.600> 60<00:04:37.930> days<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:39.040> I

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
able to stick to this for 60 days so I I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.550 
able to stick to this for 60 days so I I
think<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.450> it's<00:04:40.600> going<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.810> be<00:04:40.960> fine<00:04:41.229> of

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
think that it's going to be fine of

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.460 
think that it's going to be fine of
course<00:04:41.639> once<00:04:42.639> i<00:04:42.729> do<00:04:42.790> have<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.000> few<00:04:43.479> days<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.290> if
