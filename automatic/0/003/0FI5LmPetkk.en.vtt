okay so

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.840 
okay so
here<00:00:10.150> I'm<00:00:10.540> testing<00:00:11.170> the<00:00:12.450> a7r<00:00:14.040> a7r<00:00:15.040> is<00:00:15.520> a<00:00:15.580> new

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
here I'm testing the a7r a7r is a new

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.990 
here I'm testing the a7r a7r is a new
camera<00:00:16.119> from<00:00:16.450> sony<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:16.990> it's<00:00:17.860> a<00:00:18.250> full-frame

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
camera from sony and it's a full-frame

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.800 
camera from sony and it's a full-frame
mirrorless<00:00:19.110> camera<00:00:20.110> so<00:00:20.410> i<00:00:21.510> thought<00:00:22.510> it<00:00:22.689> was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
mirrorless camera so i thought it was

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.060 
mirrorless camera so i thought it was
really<00:00:22.960> interesting<00:00:23.140> for<00:00:23.650> me<00:00:23.680> because<00:00:23.770> I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
really interesting for me because I

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.029 
really interesting for me because I
shoot<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.340> lot<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.700> big<00:00:25.480> lenses<00:00:26.260> and<00:00:26.470> stuff<00:00:26.680> such

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
shoot a lot of big lenses and stuff such

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.220 
shoot a lot of big lenses and stuff such
as<00:00:27.250> this<00:00:27.869> 800<00:00:28.869> millimeter<00:00:29.880> 56<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.960> all

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
as this 800 millimeter 56 it's all

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.890 
as this 800 millimeter 56 it's all
manual<00:00:32.739> you<00:00:33.040> can<00:00:33.100> see<00:00:33.340> it's<00:00:33.520> got<00:00:33.699> a<00:00:33.900> in

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
manual you can see it's got a in

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.110 
manual you can see it's got a in
aperture<00:00:35.500> in<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.040> back<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.520> it's<00:00:36.699> just

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
aperture in the back and it's just

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.320 
aperture in the back and it's just
adapted<00:00:37.629> using<00:00:38.080> the<00:00:38.739> meadow<00:00:39.460> bones<00:00:39.699> adapter

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
adapted using the meadow bones adapter

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.030 
adapted using the meadow bones adapter
you<00:00:40.510> don't<00:00:40.690> need<00:00:40.930> an<00:00:41.140> electronic<00:00:41.680> adapter

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
you don't need an electronic adapter

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.830 
you don't need an electronic adapter
because<00:00:42.160> this<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.489> all<00:00:42.700> manual<00:00:43.030> lens<00:00:43.210> but<00:00:43.570> I

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
because this is all manual lens but I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740 
because this is all manual lens but I
used<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.680> electronic<00:00:45.250> adapter<00:00:45.700> on<00:00:45.910> all<00:00:46.480> my

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
used the electronic adapter on all my

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.250 
used the electronic adapter on all my
rest<00:00:47.050> of<00:00:47.170> my<00:00:47.230> canon<00:00:47.559> lenses<00:00:47.829> but<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:49.030> was<00:00:49.989> really

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
rest of my canon lenses but I was really

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.720 
rest of my canon lenses but I was really
attracted<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.250> a7r<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.430> has

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
attracted to the a7r because it has

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.190 
attracted to the a7r because it has
focus<00:00:55.690> peaking<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.670> audio<00:00:57.670> levels<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.600> my

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
focus peaking and audio levels and my

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.180 
focus peaking and audio levels and my
kin<00:00:59.440> and<00:01:01.050> headphones<00:01:02.050> so<00:01:02.350> I'm<00:01:02.469> monitoring<00:01:02.950> my

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
kin and headphones so I'm monitoring my

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.120 
kin and headphones so I'm monitoring my
audio<00:01:03.520> right<00:01:03.789> now<00:01:03.940> which<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.149> really<00:01:04.449> cool

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
audio right now which is really cool

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.670 
audio right now which is really cool
another<00:01:06.130> thing<00:01:06.399> is<00:01:06.670> as<00:01:07.600> you'll<00:01:08.110> see<00:01:08.440> as<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:10.680> rack

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
another thing is as you'll see as I rack

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.499 
another thing is as you'll see as I rack
focus<00:01:12.130> through<00:01:12.759> I<00:01:13.709> can<00:01:14.709> see<00:01:15.390> different<00:01:16.390> parts

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
focus through I can see different parts

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.779 
focus through I can see different parts
of<00:01:16.660> my<00:01:16.810> image<00:01:17.080> with<00:01:17.350> focus<00:01:17.740> peaking<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:18.280> can

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
of my image with focus peaking I can

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.680 
of my image with focus peaking I can
also<00:01:19.560> click<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:20.830> magnify<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.850> I<00:01:22.030> still<00:01:22.390> have

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
also click this magnify and I still have

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.380 
also click this magnify and I still have
the<00:01:22.959> peaking<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.580> can<00:01:24.789> go<00:01:25.030> through<00:01:25.360> and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the peaking and I can go through and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.630 
the peaking and I can go through and
fine-tune<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.140> even<00:01:26.380> more<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.800> as<00:01:27.099> you<00:01:27.520> can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
fine-tune it even more and as you can

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.830 
fine-tune it even more and as you can
see<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.819> get<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.119> tree<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.569> the<00:01:28.660> background

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
see I get that tree in the background

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.139 
see I get that tree in the background
and<00:01:29.410> then<00:01:29.560> all<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:29.709> way<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.190> far

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
and then all the way to the far

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.180 
and then all the way to the far
background<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:31.929> can<00:01:32.050> click<00:01:32.170> out<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:33.039> did

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
background and I can click out and I did

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.040 
background and I can click out and I did
that<00:01:33.369> all<00:01:33.520> during<00:01:34.030> recording<00:01:34.360> which<00:01:34.899> is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
that all during recording which is

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.570 
that all during recording which is
really<00:01:35.440> cool<00:01:35.679> so<00:01:36.160> if<00:01:36.849> you<00:01:37.030> ever<00:01:37.149> need<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:38.580> say

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
really cool so if you ever need to say

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.249 
really cool so if you ever need to say
we<00:01:39.700> move<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:39.970> camera<00:01:40.149> over<00:01:40.300> here<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.720> want<00:01:41.170> to

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
we move the camera over here I want to

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.109 
we move the camera over here I want to
get<00:01:41.319> focused<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.860> those<00:01:42.039> trees<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.789> easiest

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
get focused on those trees the easiest

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.520 
get focused on those trees the easiest
thing<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.539> I'm<00:01:43.660> just<00:01:43.720> going<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.929> pull<00:01:44.110> back<00:01:44.259> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
thing is I'm just going to pull back and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.499 
thing is I'm just going to pull back and
use<00:01:44.860> my<00:01:45.039> focus<00:01:45.369> peaking<00:01:45.580> if<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:45.970> really<00:01:46.270> need<00:01:46.420> to

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
use my focus peaking if I really need to

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.279 
use my focus peaking if I really need to
double<00:01:46.810> check<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:48.399> zoom<00:01:48.610> way<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.289> and

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
double check it I can zoom way in and

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.790 
double check it I can zoom way in and
get<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.470> really<00:01:51.160> critically<00:01:51.700> focused<00:01:52.179> and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
get it really critically focused and

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.449 
get it really critically focused and
then<00:01:53.800> zoom<00:01:54.520> out<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:56.380> cool<00:01:56.619> all<00:01:56.830> recording

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
then zoom out pretty cool all recording

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:58.919 
then zoom out pretty cool all recording
so<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.700> haven't<00:01:58.000> even<00:01:58.060> had<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.420> stop<00:01:58.630> recording

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
so I haven't even had to stop recording

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.130 
so I haven't even had to stop recording
for<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.349> which<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.069> pretty<00:02:00.220> cool<00:02:00.459> um<00:02:01.140> another

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
for this which is pretty cool um another

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.979 
for this which is pretty cool um another
thing<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.800> 1080<00:02:03.340> 60p<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.569> me<00:02:04.690> the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
thing is it is 1080 60p so for me the

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.880 
thing is it is 1080 60p so for me the
video<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.560> pretty<00:02:06.069> killer<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.860> probably<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
video is pretty killer the probably the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.729 
video is pretty killer the probably the
biggest<00:02:09.550> benefit<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.630> since<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
biggest benefit is since this is a

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.250 
biggest benefit is since this is a
merciless<00:02:12.160> mirrorless<00:02:12.940> camera<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.660> has<00:02:14.050> an

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
merciless mirrorless camera it has an

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.479 
merciless mirrorless camera it has an
evf<00:02:14.860> instead<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.330> traditional<00:02:17.489> optical

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
evf instead of a traditional optical

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.309 
evf instead of a traditional optical
viewfinder<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.329> when<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.260> stick<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:20.890> head<00:02:21.280> up

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
viewfinder so when I stick my head up

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.809

and take a photo it'd be a pretty high
resolution<00:03:33.720> than<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.959> could<00:03:34.139> zoom<00:03:34.319> way<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:34.590> so

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
its small lightweight relatively cheap

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.330 
its small lightweight relatively cheap
kind<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.689> weather<00:03:54.900> shield<00:03:55.169> I<00:03:55.439> don't<00:03:55.650> know<00:03:55.739> how

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
kind of weather shield I don't know how

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.740 
kind of weather shield I don't know how
good<00:03:56.639> their<00:03:56.819> weather<00:03:57.000> sealing<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.479> but<00:03:57.659> they

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
good their weather sealing is but they

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.899 
good their weather sealing is but they
say<00:03:57.930> I'm<00:03:58.199> not<00:03:58.259> really<00:03:58.889> too<00:03:59.310> stoked<00:03:59.639> on<00:03:59.879> this

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
say I'm not really too stoked on this

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.710 
say I'm not really too stoked on this
hinge<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:02.189> I<00:04:02.310> shoot<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.759> the<00:04:03.540> beach

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
hinge just because I shoot in the beach

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.479 
hinge just because I shoot in the beach
and<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.290> think<00:04:04.500> they'll<00:04:04.680> probably<00:04:04.919> get<00:04:05.099> sand<00:04:05.370> in

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
and I think they'll probably get sand in

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.659 
and I think they'll probably get sand in
that<00:04:05.669> so<00:04:06.349> that'll<00:04:07.349> probably<00:04:07.560> be<00:04:07.709> something

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
that so that'll probably be something

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.869 
that so that'll probably be something
that<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.969> want<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.180> keep<00:04:09.329> an<00:04:09.389> eye<00:04:09.509> on<00:04:10.879> but

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
that I want to keep an eye on but

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.360 
that I want to keep an eye on but
overall<00:04:12.150> really<00:04:12.750> impressed<00:04:13.560> with<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.859> a7r
