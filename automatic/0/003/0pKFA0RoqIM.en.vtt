00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
both layers at the same time I caught

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
both layers at the same time I caught
one<00:02:01.380> layer<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> time<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.219> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> go

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
one layer at a time and just kind of go

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480 
one layer at a time and just kind of go
a<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.990> an<00:02:04.140> angular<00:02:04.829> kind<00:02:05.280> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
a more of like a like an angular kind of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the ends like that so the ends coming

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.250 
the ends like that so the ends coming
curl<00:02:25.380> up<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:26.940> see<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:27.480> when<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> pulled<00:02:28.140> on

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
curl up can you see how when I pulled on

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.060 
curl up can you see how when I pulled on
it<00:02:28.320> they<00:02:28.650> curled<00:02:29.010> up<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.310> little<00:02:29.550> bit<00:02:30.860> yeah<00:02:31.860> so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
it they curled up a little bit yeah so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.530 
it they curled up a little bit yeah so
that<00:02:32.250> ends<00:02:32.490> kind<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.850> curled<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.270> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that ends kind of curled up like that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.850 
that ends kind of curled up like that
and<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:33.930> what<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> kind<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.410> want<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.680> do

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and that's what you kind of want to do

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.650 
and that's what you kind of want to do
so<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.220> get<00:02:35.460> rid<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> line<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.330> curl

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
so you get rid of the line so they curl

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.500 
so you get rid of the line so they curl
up<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.920> flip<00:02:38.250> arms<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.000> typically

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
up a little bit so flip arms I typically

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.050 
up a little bit so flip arms I typically
like<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.620> cut<00:02:41.250> basically<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
like to do is just cut basically the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.870 
like to do is just cut basically the
entire<00:02:42.320> sleeve<00:02:43.320> off<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.550> don't<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.760> if

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
entire sleeve off and I don't know if

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.000 
entire sleeve off and I don't know if
you<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.240> those<00:02:45.480> very<00:02:45.630> faint<00:02:46.200> line<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.830> where

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
you have those very faint line of where

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.300 
you have those very faint line of where
the<00:02:47.160> sleep<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.760> sewn<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.440> basically<00:02:49.440> cut<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the sleep is sewn on basically cut a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.300 
the sleep is sewn on basically cut a
little<00:02:50.940> bit<00:02:51.180> over<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.690> line<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:53.130> this

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
little bit over that line and then this

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.010 
little bit over that line and then this
and<00:02:53.640> then<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.090> basically<00:02:54.420> cut<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.750> sleeve

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
and then just basically cut the sleeve

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.660 
and then just basically cut the sleeve
off<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.800> later<00:02:55.980> adjust<00:02:56.490> how

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
off and then you can later adjust how

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.090 
off and then you can later adjust how
big<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.060> want<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.360> because<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.920> cut

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
big you want it because if you cut

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430 
big you want it because if you cut
anywhere<00:02:59.520> after<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.210> line<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
anywhere after this line it's going to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.810 
anywhere after this line it's going to
look<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.620> weird<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.400> long<00:03:02.520> as<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> just

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
look really weird so as long as you just

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.470 
look really weird so as long as you just
cut<00:03:03.240> close<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> line<00:03:04.130> first<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.430> yep<00:03:06.300> oh

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
cut close to the line first and yep oh

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.360 
cut close to the line first and yep oh
you're<00:03:07.140> right<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.710> is<00:03:07.860> what<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.100> shirt

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you're right back this is what the shirt

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.670 
you're right back this is what the shirt
looks<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:08.760> after<00:03:09.180> having<00:03:09.690> cut<00:03:09.930> off<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.350> lot<00:03:10.650> of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
looks like after having cut off a lot of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.890 
looks like after having cut off a lot of
the<00:03:10.980> length<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.580> cutting<00:03:12.390> off<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.720> sleeves

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the length and cutting off the sleeves

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.860 
the length and cutting off the sleeves
as<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.710> see<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.940> not<00:03:15.300> looking<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.840> a

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
