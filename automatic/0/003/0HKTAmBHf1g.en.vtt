00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.289
 maserati attacks 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.960
 with trans axle technikum pininfarina 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:25.070
 a designer who shapes steel sheet out 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.560
 as a fuel maserati is where it is 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.810
 belongs to ferrari at schumi and co 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.970
 away from 4 where the brand with the 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.329
 trident grow half-heartedly at best 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 was 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.820
 since 1997 she is part of the grupo ferrari 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.070
 maserati and that's good 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.730
 the self-confidence and the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.730
 motors on 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.230
 for the real lover is the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.390
 no noise 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.500
 it's music and the eight-cylinder make 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.500
 a wonderful music 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.110
 it is the sound of the infected maserati 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.270
 Fans are investing bucks of money in 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 her old in the drill blew bi 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.260
 turbo s she came in and more than 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 Spare parts are hard to get and 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.370
 hit corresponding holes in the account 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.720
 but the car with the dreizack attack 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.610
 it seems to be worth it 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 He is almost told human traits 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 the maserati is a car that very much 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.940
 is individualistic and one 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 you can have it great character 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.760
 almost as a charismatic car 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.430
 describe 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.170
 a car like the ghibli with a 4 9 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.270
 liter motor has enormous power 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.400
 It used to be said in Italy 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.400
 gentleman maserati driving and playboy 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 the maserati brothers are from 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.939
 Bologna is the city's landmark 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.290
 Neptune's trident originally had one 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.299
 only racing cars and no 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.490
 Road cars too can be explained with that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.270
 that maserati is very sporty today 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270
 is positioned 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.840
 the factory in modena is clean here 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.270
 and quietly there are at maserati 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.740
 08 and soon also a twelve-cylinder 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.480
 and they are not only gorgeous 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.350
 to listen but also wonderful 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.240
 to look 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.610
 On the test stand they run some 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.430
 minutes and are turned up to 7,500 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.290
 because who like maserati in the high price 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
 wants to conquer segment market share 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.940
 not 100 but 150 percent 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 Quality deliver under sticks the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.880
 Italian manufacturer until today not 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.880
 the very best image 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.130
 We understand our craftsmanship and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.930
 this creates a unique 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.260
 product that gives the driver 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.240
 highest level of emotion and driving pleasure 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.830
 It is a car with soul and that is 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.290
 what we pass on to our customers 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.720
 want the enjoyment of the fun of this car 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.890
 to drive 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.270
 you can really get worse 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.340
 imagine as a ride in the maserati 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.410
 spyder with 390 ps 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.970
 but we still do not forgive it 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.600
 that we choose the safe ones 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.600
 have taken 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.270
 a peculiarity of maserati that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.740
 transaxle principle that the gear for 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.110
 a better weight distribution on the 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.060
 Rear axle link trans axle is a 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.230
 very complicated procedure the other 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.230
 manufacturers too expensive 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.180
 maserati is below ferrari 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.040
 but positioned above alpha it 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.270
 could be that alfa romeo in 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.470
 the group ferrari maserati 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.180
 is incorporated 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.650
 thus, the group could be in each 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.400
 Price class a sporty model 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 to offer 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.180
 maserati is a small producer of 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.830
 just 3,000 cars per year today 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.750
 produced in the future with the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.580
 quattroporte we will then at 6,000 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.680
 maybe someday it will be long 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.250
 once 10,000 manufactured vehicles per 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.230
 be year 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.120
 but we are talking about cars here 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.680
 Everything is created by hand and that in 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.209
 a very small factory where the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.070
 Employees do a lot by hand 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.079
 so maserati is a real one 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.970
 italian product we build here 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.549
 no industrial commodities 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.240
 Today, 15 20 cars per day leave the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.240
 do not work anymore 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.740
 small but fine wants to be maserati 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.170
 Also the model range is not very 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.720
 big there is the coupe the spyder and 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.920
 currently quattroporte not no more 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.920
 no SUV 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.820
 the brand maserati has only for years 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.199
 It is the race car manufactured 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.330
 express wish of maserati 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.520
 president luca di montezemolo 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.199
 the maserati in his returns that 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.000
 Racing has always been the life of maserati 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.000
 and will it be again in the future 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.970
 a first step back to the 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.220
 race track is the trofeo maserati one 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.530
 exclusive class for maserati customers 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.450

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.430
 gt coupe s put on the wheels 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.440
 we are curious what is to come 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.510
 market with maserati goes where the 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.080
