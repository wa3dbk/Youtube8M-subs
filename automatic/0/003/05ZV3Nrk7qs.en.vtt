00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.400 
actually take advantage of it and give
my<00:02:23.520> beltless<00:02:24.030> squats<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:24.780> run<00:02:24.989> now

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
my beltless squats a little run now

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.800 
my beltless squats a little run now
beltless<00:02:25.920> squatting<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:27.599> beneficial

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
beltless squatting is really beneficial

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.620 
beltless squatting is really beneficial
and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.770> will<00:02:28.890> cross<00:02:29.220> over<00:02:29.430> nicely<00:02:29.819> into<00:02:30.420> your

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
and it will cross over nicely into your

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.620 
and it will cross over nicely into your
belt<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.200> squat<00:02:31.670> when<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.819> squat<00:02:33.120> beltless

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
belt in squat when you squat beltless

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.630 
belt in squat when you squat beltless
obviously<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.739> don't<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.220> benefit<00:02:35.610> of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
obviously you don't have the benefit of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.250 
obviously you don't have the benefit of
the<00:02:35.970> belt<00:02:36.270> wrapped<00:02:36.569> around<00:02:36.750> your<00:02:37.050> midsection

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the belt wrapped around your midsection

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.900 
the belt wrapped around your midsection
when<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.129> belts<00:02:38.430> around<00:02:38.489> your<00:02:38.700> midsection

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
when it belts around your midsection

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.610 
when it belts around your midsection
what<00:02:39.540> you're<00:02:39.660> supposed<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.080> do<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.290> breathe

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
what you're supposed to do is breathe

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.650 
what you're supposed to do is breathe
deep<00:02:41.010> into<00:02:41.340> your<00:02:41.430> stomach<00:02:41.700> expand<00:02:42.360> your<00:02:42.390> ab

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
deep into your stomach expand your ab

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.360 
deep into your stomach expand your ab
walls<00:02:42.930> against<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> belt<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.010> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
walls against the belt and that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.309 
walls against the belt and that
compression<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.750> air<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.200> stomach

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
compression all the air in your stomach

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.869 
compression all the air in your stomach
pushing<00:02:46.739> hard<00:02:46.980> against<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.340> belt<00:02:47.580> it's

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
pushing hard against that belt it's

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.370 
pushing hard against that belt it's
going<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.060> cost<00:02:48.270> compression<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.080> that's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
going to cost compression and that's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.710 
going to cost compression and that's
going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> force<00:02:49.980> your<00:02:50.220> torso<00:02:50.520> upright<00:02:51.090> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
going to force your torso upright so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.180 
going to force your torso upright so
basically<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> belt<00:02:52.530> will<00:02:52.680> help<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:52.950> remain

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
basically the belt will help you remain

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.990 
basically the belt will help you remain
upright

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
upright

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.090 
upright
and<00:02:54.150> generate<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> lot<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.930> power<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.890> when<00:02:56.010> you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and generate a lot of power but when you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.400 
and generate a lot of power but when you
remove<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.820> belt<00:02:57.030> now<00:02:57.600> it's<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.230> your

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
remove the belt now it's up to your

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.890 
remove the belt now it's up to your
abdominal<00:02:59.340> muscles<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.270> your<00:03:00.390> core

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
abdominal muscles it's up to your core

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.160 
abdominal muscles it's up to your core
as<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> whole<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.100> really<00:03:02.610> work<00:03:02.850> hard<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.540> hold

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
as a whole to really work hard and hold

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.780 
as a whole to really work hard and hold
your<00:03:04.380> body<00:03:04.500> upright<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.400> barbell

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
your body upright because that barbell

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.250 
your body upright because that barbell
obviously<00:03:06.150> wants<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.420> bring<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> downwards

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
obviously wants to bring it downwards

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.290 
obviously wants to bring it downwards
towards<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.680> floor<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.490> also<00:03:08.850> going<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
towards the floor it's also going to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.810 
towards the floor it's also going to
cause<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> use<00:03:10.380> your<00:03:10.410> abdominal<00:03:11.040> walls<00:03:11.520> a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
cause you to use your abdominal walls a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.449 
cause you to use your abdominal walls a
lot<00:03:12.180> more<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.750> simply<00:03:13.260> holding<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> air<00:03:14.040> into

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
lot more in simply holding the air into

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.800 
lot more in simply holding the air into
your<00:03:14.580> stomach<00:03:14.850> because<00:03:15.480> now<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.690> have

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
your stomach because now you have

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.110 
your stomach because now you have
nothing<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> compress<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.650> air<00:03:16.950> against<00:03:17.550> so

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
nothing to compress that air against so

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.449 
nothing to compress that air against so
training<00:03:18.840> your<00:03:19.200> core<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.590> your<00:03:19.800> abs<00:03:20.130> to

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
training your core and your abs to

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.220 
training your core and your abs to
become<00:03:20.700> really<00:03:21.000> strong<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.780> keeping<00:03:22.140> your

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
become really strong and keeping your

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.990 
become really strong and keeping your
body<00:03:22.350> upright<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.160> taking<00:03:23.490> an<00:03:23.580> air<00:03:23.820> without

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
body upright and taking an air without

the<00:03:24.270> compression<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.959> bell<00:03:25.200> will<00:03:25.830> carry

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
the compression of a bell will carry

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.100 
the compression of a bell will carry
over<00:03:26.250> nicely<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.090> when<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.300> finally<00:03:27.510> do<00:03:27.870> put

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
over nicely to when you finally do put

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.440 
over nicely to when you finally do put
on<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.230> belt<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:29.280> recommend<00:03:29.610> everybody<00:03:30.030> does

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
on a belt and I recommend everybody does

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.699 
on a belt and I recommend everybody does

pregnancy wearing a belt on their
heavier<00:03:32.010> sets<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.940> simply<00:03:33.330> will<00:03:33.450> not<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.870> able

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
heavier sets you simply will not be able

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.479 
heavier sets you simply will not be able
to<00:03:34.140> get<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> most<00:03:34.709> out<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:34.980> your<00:03:35.160> squat

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
to get the most out of your squat

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.820 
to get the most out of your squat
without<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.850> belt<00:03:36.120> there's<00:03:37.110> not<00:03:37.200> one<00:03:37.260> lifter

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
without a belt there's not one lifter

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.440 
without a belt there's not one lifter
who's<00:03:38.010> maxed<00:03:38.459> out<00:03:38.580> some<00:03:38.790> world<00:03:38.970> record<00:03:39.300> on<00:03:39.330> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
who's maxed out some world record on the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.000 
who's maxed out some world record on the
squat<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.959> then<00:03:40.140> can't<00:03:40.380> do<00:03:40.530> more<00:03:40.770> with<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
squat and then can't do more with the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.560 
squat and then can't do more with the
belt<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.489> practice<00:03:41.970> wearing<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> belt<00:03:42.390> through

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
belt so practice wearing a belt through

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.510 
belt so practice wearing a belt through
because<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.930> its<00:03:43.110> own<00:03:43.200> skill<00:03:43.650> training

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
because it is its own skill training

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.820 
because it is its own skill training
beltless<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.270> also<00:03:45.540> potentially<00:03:46.320> safer

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
beltless is also potentially safer

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.790 
beltless is also potentially safer
because<00:03:47.160> when<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> have<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> belt<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.989> the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
because when you have a belt on and the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.229 
because when you have a belt on and the
weight<00:03:49.950> starts<00:03:50.280> feeling<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:50.730> heavy<00:03:51.000> you

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
weight starts feeling really heavy you

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.000 
weight starts feeling really heavy you
can<00:03:51.390> then<00:03:51.600> default<00:03:52.200> into<00:03:52.560> like<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> good

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
can then default into like a good

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.710 
can then default into like a good
morning<00:03:53.400> position<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:53.970> kind<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.209> grind<00:03:54.570> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
morning position and kind of grind the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.660 
morning position and kind of grind the
weight<00:03:54.870> up<00:03:55.080> but<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> course<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.400> lead<00:03:56.640> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
weight up but of course that can lead to

much of a good morning stance because

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.729 
much of a good morning stance because
your<00:04:03.360> core<00:04:03.570> simply<00:04:03.959> can't<00:04:04.260> support<00:04:04.650> that

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
your core simply can't support that

your core simply can't support that
you'll<00:04:05.489> end<00:04:05.670> up<00:04:05.760> buckling<00:04:06.269> you'll<00:04:06.570> probably

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you'll end up buckling you'll probably

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.940 
you'll end up buckling you'll probably
just<00:04:06.900> drop<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.350> weight<00:04:07.500> if<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.739> way<00:04:07.830> it's

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
just drop the weight if the way it's

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.410 
just drop the weight if the way it's
heavy<00:04:08.100> enough<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.670> kind<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:08.940> forces<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.330> to

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
heavy enough so it kind of forces you to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.960 
heavy enough so it kind of forces you to
either<00:04:09.570> maintain<00:04:09.870> proper<00:04:10.769> stance<00:04:11.160> or<00:04:11.459> not<00:04:11.820> at

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
all which is always a plus what's insane

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.400 
all which is always a plus what's insane
to<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:14.940> about<00:04:15.299> is<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.570> fact<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:16.229> too

long<00:04:16.440> ago<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:17.100> remember<00:04:17.400> uploading<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.880> video<00:04:18.090> in

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
long ago I remember uploading a video in

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.800 
long ago I remember uploading a video in
which<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.109> performed<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:19.919> single<00:04:20.669> maximum<00:04:21.540> rep

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
which I performed one single maximum rep

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.580 
which I performed one single maximum rep
set<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.800> squats<00:04:23.160> with<00:04:23.610> 320<00:04:24.390> pounds<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.020> I

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
set on the squats with 320 pounds and I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.260 
set on the squats with 320 pounds and I
might<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:25.890> gotten<00:04:26.070> like<00:04:26.340> 10<00:04:26.370> reps<00:04:26.850> out<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.150> it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
might have gotten like 10 reps out of it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.840 
might have gotten like 10 reps out of it
but<00:04:27.390> that<00:04:27.540> was<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.990> was<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.530> all<00:04:28.919> out<00:04:28.979> max

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
but that was it it was one all out max

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.420 
but that was it it was one all out max
effort<00:04:30.150> set<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.990> maximum<00:04:31.800> reps<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.280> got

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
effort set of maximum reps and I got

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.280 
effort set of maximum reps and I got
like<00:04:32.580> ten<00:04:32.880> wearing<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.570> belt<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.870> everything

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
beltless like it's crazy just to see

your progression sometimes and it

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.380 
your progression sometimes and it
doesn't<00:04:47.400> always<00:04:47.520> show<00:04:47.729> up<00:04:47.760> in<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.030> form<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.300> a

one rep max it can show and more
discreet<00:04:50.400> ways<00:04:50.580> like<00:04:50.820> day<00:04:50.970> two<00:04:51.030> day<00:04:51.210> training

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450

discreet ways like day two day training
so<00:04:52.410> today<00:04:53.010> we're<00:04:53.190> doing<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.729> lightweight

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
so today we're doing just lightweight

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.490

the<00:04:59.010> only<00:04:59.160> reason<00:04:59.370> I'm<00:04:59.430> even<00:04:59.490> wearing<00:04:59.669> a<00:04:59.850> belt
