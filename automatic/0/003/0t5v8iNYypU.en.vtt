that only the fit population of tigers
can<00:02:17.370> survive<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.650> make<00:02:19.920> us<00:02:20.160> better<00:02:20.520> hunters

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
can survive you make us better hunters

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.410 
can survive you make us better hunters
too<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.950> don't<00:02:23.160> see<00:02:23.460> me<00:02:23.700> complaining<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
too you don't see me complaining that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.890 
too you don't see me complaining that
you<00:02:24.840> cheat<00:02:25.260> all<00:02:25.440> deer<00:02:25.770> run<00:02:26.610> too<00:02:26.940> fast<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.660> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you cheat all deer run too fast and I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.580 
you cheat all deer run too fast and I
have<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> keep<00:02:28.500> up<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:30.320> see<00:02:31.320> how

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
have to keep up with you I see how

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.990 
have to keep up with you I see how
coevolution<00:02:32.250> works<00:02:33.000> both<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.260> our<00:02:34.470> species

coevolution works both of our species
need<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.270> keep<00:02:36.540> evolving<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.500> getting<00:02:38.220> better

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and better in order to survive does this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.200 
and better in order to survive does this
mean<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.770> get<00:02:44.040> faster<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.150> faster

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
mean that we will get faster and faster

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.400 
mean that we will get faster and faster
oh<00:02:48.020> definitely

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
oh definitely

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.820 
oh definitely
my<00:02:50.070> children<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.880> already<00:02:51.270> much<00:02:51.960> faster<00:02:52.620> than

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
my children are already much faster than

my children are already much faster than
my<00:02:53.040> ancestors<00:02:53.880> were<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:55.020> if<00:02:55.290> they<00:02:55.470> were<00:02:55.530> not

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
my ancestors were and if they were not

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.270 
my ancestors were and if they were not
chances<00:02:57.240> are<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.350> would<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.770> survive

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
chances are that they would not survive
