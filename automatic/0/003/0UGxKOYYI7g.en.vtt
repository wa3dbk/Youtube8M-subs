look<00:00:29.820> similar<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.539> plant<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.279> they're

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
look similar to this plant and they're

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.670 
look similar to this plant and they're
very<00:00:32.489> hard<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> control<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> garden<00:00:34.050> here

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720 
notice this one has been pulled up by
the<00:00:51.360> roots<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.890> typical<00:00:53.280> garden<00:00:53.489> or

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
things that they get this whenever they

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
things that they get this whenever they
pull<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> ground<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.460> not

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
pull it out of the ground but that's not

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.380 
pull it out of the ground but that's not
the<00:00:56.820> case

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the case

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
the case

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
but if you look here and also you'll see

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.880 
but if you look here and also you'll see
a<00:01:00.570> close-up<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:01.649> they're

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a close-up of this as well they're

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
a close-up of this as well they're
called<00:01:02.070> nuts<00:01:02.340> edge<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:03.000> under<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
called nuts edge because under the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
called nuts edge because under the
ground<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> along<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> route<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.710> form

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
ground and along the route they form

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
ground and along the route they form
these<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.960> nodules<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
these little nodules that look like a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
these little nodules that look like a
type<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> peanut<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.479> nuts<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.590> do

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
type of peanut or nuts and what they do

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.640 
type of peanut or nuts and what they do
is<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.070> connect<00:01:11.549> by<00:01:11.880> those<00:01:12.119> nuts<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.350> that's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
is they connect by those nuts and that's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
is they connect by those nuts and that's
it's<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> name<00:01:14.610> nut<00:01:14.970> sedge

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it's where they got the name nut sedge

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
it's where they got the name nut sedge
but<00:01:16.049> they'll<00:01:16.200> connect<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.009> by<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
but they'll connect from there by the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
but they'll connect from there by the
root<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.450> come<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.990> another<00:01:19.140> plant<00:01:19.680> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
root and come up with another plant so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990 
root and come up with another plant so
when<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> pull<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.759> plant<00:01:23.759> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
when you pull these about the plant you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240 
when you pull these about the plant you
typically<00:01:24.509> pull<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.869> apart<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> leave

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
typically pull them apart but you leave

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.620 
typically pull them apart but you leave
a<00:01:26.280> part<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> root<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> ground<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
a part of the root in the ground and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.789 
a part of the root in the ground and
that's<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> come<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.530> another

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that's going to come back as another

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.490 
that's going to come back as another
sedge<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> broadleaf<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.350> you'll

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
sedge now this is a broadleaf and you'll

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
sedge now this is a broadleaf and you'll
see<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> close-up<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.520> meaning<00:01:33.090> broad

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
see in the close-up now meaning broad

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
see in the close-up now meaning broad
leaf<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.200> leaves<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:34.799> small<00:01:35.130> but

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
leaf the leaves are very small but

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
leaf the leaves are very small but
nonetheless<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.060> still<00:01:36.090> broadleaf<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
nonetheless it's still broadleaf if you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.130 
nonetheless it's still broadleaf if you
compare<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.729> grass<00:01:38.729> blade<00:01:39.119> you're<00:01:39.840> the

that's what allows you to put a product

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.219 
that's what allows you to put a product
like<00:01:49.530> 2<00:01:49.710> 4<00:01:49.979> d<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.430> we'd<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.270> gone<00:01:51.420> anything<00:01:52.020> for

handheld pump sprayer and then the other
as<00:04:56.669> we<00:04:56.820> talked<00:04:57.060> about<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.810> can<00:04:57.960> screw<00:04:58.530> it
