00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.930
 how about fun friends how 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 more topics 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.570
 we are in the ghost of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.570
 efforts 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.470
 very good as 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 Y 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.510
 this his we saw because he does not know we know 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.300
 they make a bonus because sometimes the basic 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.369
 not leaving I'm going to teach in this 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.369
 occasion to make a magic bow 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.530
 and eating stationery or the city chaos 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.530
 you can like this 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:54.550
 in this version friends we are going to need 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.410
 the thickest obviously depending on 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.980
 the bun you want the size 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.930
 that you wish is traditional the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.089
 question of the Christmas pieces and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.550
 also scissors and if you want 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.270
 put a little bit of good shine we're going to 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.869
 put a red color but this is from 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.380
 Shiny so we're going to take 3 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.380
 meters 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.900
 do not 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.990
 yes well so we have our methods 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.049
 of ribbon cut what we're going to do 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.950
 is to fold it in half 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.009
 here we have already half folded 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.710
 and let's do let's take 18 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.570
 centimeters to bend 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.150
 and how are we going to do this 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.700
 we see it again again to the other 18 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.520
 by doubling the account a kind of 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.520
 cordial let's do with our ribbon 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.880
 so they will not lose any 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.880
 detail 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.009
 Now what we are going to do is take this 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.959
 tip bend 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.370
 and fold it and if you fit well 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.800
 there are times that scissors help us 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.880
 sometimes not 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.880
 let's cut 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.120
 once 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.770
 although we already have two points 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.410
 cut 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.910
 now what we are going to do in this part 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:44.840
 where we have left free let's put 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 here a kind of support 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.180
 our cubic ribbon and we're going to cut 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.250
 our audience about 20 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.690
 centimeters 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.440
 and we are going to do 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.600
 to take out several clients 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.370
 if you're going to do several many do not you 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.600
 worry if you marry a little bit of 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.120
 strips because this we are going to occupy 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.290
 let's prepare 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.140
 what is going to be in the mother of our 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.349
 from our monitor and well we're also going 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.409
 to cut two meters from the kundi ribbon 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:25.599
 for tying medium and we 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.599
 cut and we're going to measure them 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.900
 let's take the tip and we have 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.130
 the first part of our ribbon 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.130
 all right 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 in the first part and we are going to narrate 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.640
 our ribbon that we cut 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.700
 we are going to tie just also to the half 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.569
 let's find the way to tie it down 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.340
 inside 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.360
 here we live 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.069
 the turn to tie it 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.469
 and what we are going to do is 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.859
 inside the bar to make it the 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:12.670
 mother in and out that gives 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.670
 more aesthetic 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.129
 hey 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.060
 now what we are going to do 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.360
 let's put our ribbon 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.360
 the thin inside 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.620
 of our dres ribbon 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.930
 do it and do not go to this to 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.050
 disarm 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.520
 what we are going to do is this put the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.969
 we are going to put it here and this 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.909
 way we go 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:58.169
 with these these milestones that we cut before 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.769
 We were going to go mooring not so strong going to 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.769
 be first 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:07.230
 a simple light mooring 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.040
 if not not squeezing so much else 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:15.080
 slightly and the second if we're going to 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.080
 tie up tight let's tighten it 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.739
 we leave the bar in the middle 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.539
 we re-pair our ribbon 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.789
 and we tie again as I said 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.789
 they will tie 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.580
 the first knot will be very light 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.820
 we're not going to press it, it's going to be something very 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.540
 light 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.540
 there is the second one to ensure it 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.449
 so that we can also run our 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:06.330
 that's why it does not get so tight 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.680
 Now what we are going to do is in this 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.680
 part pulling 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.190
 care obviously done well 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.820
 waves that we are going to install 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.050
 young 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.050
 on the mobile 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.930
 here you guys if you want 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.380
 to give a touch this nice in this 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.289
 part you can cut it fold and cut 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.719
 as if it were curved 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.759
 and good as you already saw that it is 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.639
 easy and simple is to elaborate this type 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.830
 of molluscum can do it at home and 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.389
 obviously make them from the colors that 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.639
 want if you obviously want 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.819
 much bigger are obviously going to have 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:53.610
 to buy more width for cars 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.009
 making for weddings 15 years 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.020
 You can also make them at home like this 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.089
 is that we are inviting us to 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.580
 subscribe to that they give him the 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:05.629
 page and we are the dimensions of 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.629
 washington 2 and more
