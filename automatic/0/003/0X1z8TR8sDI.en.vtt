00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.839
 get an amber scorpion rider 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 the animal is pretty beautiful plus it's a little 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.510
 is not the only scorpion that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.779
 is available 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.840
 Alliance bought it in a place under 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.029
 wasteland pandaria 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 the price of a scorpion is ten thousand 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.980
 gold coins and beyond that it is necessary 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 during the ascension from the klaxxi 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.140
 however, when you upgrade your reputation 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.140
 the price will fall by two or three thousand 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.180
 and went with regards to pumping reputation then she 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.570
 dailies 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 the quest chain begins on the wall 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.360
 which separates two locations 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.760

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.680
