your average SSD this is a single PCB
inside<00:00:51.850> here<00:00:52.090> but<00:00:52.990> what<00:00:53.380> photo<00:00:53.770> foster's<00:00:54.280> done

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
inside here but what photo foster's done

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.200 
inside here but what photo foster's done
is<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.880> they<00:00:55.090> have<00:00:55.120> fitted<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.610> some<00:00:57.640> time

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210
