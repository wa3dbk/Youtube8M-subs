kind of enjoyed it and I made all I
started<00:00:22.769> making<00:00:23.000> just<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.359> deck<00:00:24.539> I

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
started making just a little deck I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
started making just a little deck I
still<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.859> still<00:00:26.099> not<00:00:26.279> finished<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.789> just

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
still it's still not finished I just

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
still it's still not finished I just
need<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> energies<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.369> I'm<00:00:29.369> far<00:00:29.699> enough

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
need the energies but I I'm far enough

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.740 
need the energies but I I'm far enough
to<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.480> show<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.750> how<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.230> make<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
to just show you how to make one so I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750 
to just show you how to make one so I
guess<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> best

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
guess this is just this is not the best

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.540 
guess this is just this is not the best
deck<00:00:36.260> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> best<00:00:37.860> strategy<00:00:38.070> I'm

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
deck this is not the best strategy I'm

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
deck this is not the best strategy I'm
making<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.140> good<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> start<00:00:40.649> out

of Pokemon
well<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> suggest<00:01:00.780> using<00:01:00.930> two<00:01:01.230> types<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
well I suggest using two types of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
well I suggest using two types of
Pokemon<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.940> variety<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
Pokemon just to have more variety of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
Pokemon just to have more variety of
what<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> made<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> fire<00:01:06.900> type<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
what you want so I made a fire type in a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.030 
what you want so I made a fire type in a
as<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.200> fire<00:01:10.439> type<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.950> an

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
as you can see the fire type in an

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.940 
as you can see the fire type in an
electric-type<00:01:11.520> deck

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
electric-type deck

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.020 
electric-type deck
we're<00:01:13.950> first<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> start<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.820> my

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we're first going to start out with my

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.289 
we're first going to start out with my
fire<00:01:15.330> type<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> how<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> did<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.090> let<00:01:18.270> me

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
fire type and how I did it so let me

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
fire type and how I did it so let me
just<00:01:18.689> separate<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:23.360> alright<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just separate these two alright so I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.480 
just separate these two alright so I
suggest<00:01:26.759> using<00:01:27.049> 15<00:01:28.049> cards<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.680> each<00:01:28.770> type<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
suggest using 15 cards for each type so

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.830 
suggest using 15 cards for each type so
like<00:01:29.850> 15<00:01:30.299> fires<00:01:30.890> 15<00:01:32.000> electric<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.270> 15

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
like 15 fires 15 electric and 15

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
like 15 fires 15 electric and 15
trainers<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.530> 15<00:01:36.170> energies<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.009> we're

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
trainers and then 15 energies so we're

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.289 
trainers and then 15 energies so we're
just<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.460> start<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.939> how<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> made<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:41.299> the

Dharma tha's to brow lifts to pans ears
and<00:02:21.280> one<00:02:21.849> more<00:02:22.120> Vesta<00:02:22.599> so<00:02:23.439> I<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.860> suggest

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
and one more Vesta so I just suggest

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.550 
and one more Vesta so I just suggest
just<00:02:24.670> using<00:02:25.120> four<00:02:25.480> evolve<00:02:25.780> Pokemon<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.470> then

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
just using four evolve Pokemon and then

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.440 
just using four evolve Pokemon and then
seven<00:02:27.010> other<00:02:27.159> different<00:02:27.940> types<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.420> that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
seven other different types so that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.729 
seven other different types so that
makes<00:02:28.900> 15

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
makes 15

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.000 
makes 15
so<00:02:30.549> that's<00:02:30.879> fit<00:02:31.360> that's<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.500> first<00:02:32.709> 15

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so that's fit that's so the first 15

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380 
so that's fit that's so the first 15

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
and another evolve which is been seen oh

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.210 
and another evolve which is been seen oh
and<00:03:33.970> since<00:03:34.599> you<00:03:34.900> know<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.079> think<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.889> Chino

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
and since you know I think it's in Chino

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.159 
and since you know I think it's in Chino
I'm<00:03:36.459> not<00:03:36.609> really<00:03:36.790> sure<00:03:37.000> but<00:03:37.389> I<00:03:37.599> really<00:03:37.989> like

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
I'm not really sure but I really like

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.780 
I'm not really sure but I really like
these<00:03:38.859> this<00:03:39.459> evolved<00:03:39.879> because<00:03:41.609> let's<00:03:42.609> say

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
these this evolved because let's say

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.330 
these this evolved because let's say
you're<00:03:42.940> already<00:03:43.090> evolved<00:03:43.510> from<00:03:44.230> Massino<00:03:45.129> and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
you're already evolved from Massino and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.809 
you're already evolved from Massino and
-<00:03:45.489> since<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.879> know<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.530> can

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
- since you know you can do you can

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.740 
- since you know you can do you can
attach<00:03:48.819> one<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.739> attach<00:03:51.040> one<00:03:51.540> energy<00:03:52.540> and

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
attach one you can attach one energy and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.199 
attach one you can attach one energy and
then<00:03:52.870> use<00:03:53.079> tail<00:03:53.379> slap<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:54.010> slow<00:03:54.370> them<00:03:54.519> down<00:03:54.549> and

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
then use tail slap to slow them down and

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.270 
then use tail slap to slow them down and
then<00:03:55.329> attach<00:03:55.599> another<00:03:56.109> energy<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.739> do<00:03:56.889> do<00:03:57.129> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
then attach another energy and do do the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.849 
then attach another energy and do do the
wave<00:03:57.430> this<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.909> a<00:03:57.940> pretty<00:03:58.480> good<00:03:58.659> attack<00:03:58.959> it

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
wave this is a pretty good attack it

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.979 
wave this is a pretty good attack it
does<00:04:00.040> 20<00:04:00.459> damage<00:04:00.489> times<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.359> number<00:04:01.659> of<00:04:01.690> your

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
does 20 damage times the number of your

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.949 
does 20 damage times the number of your
bench<00:04:02.199> Pokemon<00:04:02.859> so<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.239> like<00:04:04.449> let's<00:04:04.810> see

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
bench Pokemon so that is like let's see

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.559 
bench Pokemon so that is like let's see
if<00:04:05.169> I<00:04:05.440> think<00:04:05.859> let's<00:04:06.730> say<00:04:06.879> you<00:04:06.940> have<00:04:07.060> like<00:04:07.209> 4

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
if I think let's say you have like 4

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.960 
if I think let's say you have like 4
bench<00:04:07.810> Pokemon<00:04:08.229> 20<00:04:08.919> times<00:04:09.129> 4<00:04:09.430> that's<00:04:09.459> easily

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
bench Pokemon 20 times 4 that's easily

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.270 
bench Pokemon 20 times 4 that's easily
like<00:04:11.400> 80<00:04:12.400> 80<00:04:13.359> hit<00:04:13.629> points<00:04:14.019> so<00:04:14.199> that's<00:04:14.829> very

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
like 80 80 hit points so that's very

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.649 
like 80 80 hit points so that's very
that's<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.669> very<00:04:15.699> good<00:04:16.000> attack<00:04:16.269> if<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.510> have

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
that's a very good attack if you have

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.659 
that's a very good attack if you have
all<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.840> bench<00:04:17.199> put<00:04:17.380> them<00:04:17.530> on<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.070> also<00:04:18.310> has

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
all I bench put them on and it also has

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.200 
all I bench put them on and it also has
an<00:04:19.299> exceptional<00:04:19.959> amount<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.560> HP<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:21.280> yeah

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
an exceptional amount of HP so yeah

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.480 
an exceptional amount of HP so yeah
that<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.840> those<00:04:23.110> are<00:04:23.260> two<00:04:23.409> very

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
that is those are two very

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.750 
that is those are two very
that's<00:04:25.180> one<00:04:25.420> very<00:04:25.600> good<00:04:26.130> evolved<00:04:27.130> Asian<00:04:27.490> and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
that's one very good evolved Asian and

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.990 
that's one very good evolved Asian and
we<00:04:27.970> also<00:04:28.090> got<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.720> basic<00:04:29.290> Jigglypuff<00:04:30.160> which<00:04:30.580> I

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
we also got a basic Jigglypuff which I

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.930 
we also got a basic Jigglypuff which I
like<00:04:31.540> because<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.830> all<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.490> need<00:04:33.640> is<00:04:33.760> one
