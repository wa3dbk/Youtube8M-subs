believe<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.129> pug<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.120> his

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
believe it was pug but when he got his

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
believe it was pug but when he got his
past<00:00:45.570> pug<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.989> offsides<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> mile<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.100> can

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
past pug was offsides by a mile you can

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270 
past pug was offsides by a mile you can
tell<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.350> Vidal<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.680> time<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
tell and Vidal was on time but it was

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100 
tell and Vidal was on time but it was
the<00:00:50.430> past<00:00:50.610> before<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.809> should<00:00:52.020> have

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the past before that so it should have

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.810 
the past before that so it should have
been<00:00:52.199> called<00:00:52.410> offsides<00:00:52.800> before<00:00:53.190> he<00:00:53.489> even<00:00:53.579> got

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
been called offsides before he even got

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.850 
been called offsides before he even got
the<00:00:53.879> pass<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> score<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> nice

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the pass to score but it was a nice

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.369 
the pass to score but it was a nice
finish<00:00:56.160> by<00:00:56.190> him<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:57.629> discounting<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
finish by him if you're discounting the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.479 
finish by him if you're discounting the
offsides<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.570> they<00:01:00.570> were<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.829> 110<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
offsides and they were up 110 in the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.780 
offsides and they were up 110 in the
first<00:01:02.760> 18<00:01:03.149> seconds<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.409> crazy<00:01:04.790> then

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
first 18 seconds so that's crazy then

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.359 
first 18 seconds so that's crazy then
