was like yeah I'm gonna hurting my hair
so<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.730> basically<00:04:07.209> just<00:04:07.570> asked<00:04:08.200> for<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.739> balayage

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
so I basically just asked for a balayage

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.610 
so I basically just asked for a balayage
ombre<00:04:09.940> balayage<00:04:10.600> is<00:04:10.930> just<00:04:11.110> when<00:04:11.230> they<00:04:11.350> paint

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
ombre balayage is just when they paint

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.040

on<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.370> hair<00:04:12.760> it's<00:04:12.910> basically<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.720> think<00:04:13.840> is

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
on a hair it's basically the I think is

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.690

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.330 
they look a lot softer and more natural
than<00:04:21.510> basically<00:04:22.350> any<00:04:22.620> other<00:04:22.710> method<00:04:23.190> that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
than basically any other method that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.310 
than basically any other method that
I've<00:04:23.460> seen<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.690> that's<00:04:24.870> actually<00:04:25.050> her

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
I've seen and that's actually her

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.750 
I've seen and that's actually her
favorite<00:04:25.500> method<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.130> worked<00:04:26.400> out<00:04:26.550> really

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
favorite method so I worked out really

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.670 
favorite method so I worked out really
well<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:27.930> just<00:04:27.960> asked<00:04:28.230> her<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.470> keep<00:04:28.590> it

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
well and I just asked her to keep it

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.930 
well and I just asked her to keep it
like<00:04:28.860> low<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> back<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.640> bring<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.790> up

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
like low in the back and bring it up

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.280 
like low in the back and bring it up
higher<00:04:30.120> around<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.540> face<00:04:30.750> just<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.140> get<00:04:31.260> a

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
higher around the face just to get a

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.080 
higher around the face just to get a
more<00:04:31.350> sunkissed<00:04:31.890> love<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.520> then<00:04:32.670> she<00:04:32.910> would

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
more sunkissed love and then she would

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.630 
more sunkissed love and then she would
like<00:04:33.390> basically<00:04:33.900> take<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> section<00:04:34.410> do<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.370> light

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
like basically take a section do a light

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.240 
like basically take a section do a light
teasing<00:04:36.060> on<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.420> paint<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.740> lightener

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
teasing on it paint on the lightener

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.160 
teasing on it paint on the lightener
then<00:04:38.760> set<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> side<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:39.810> then<00:04:39.990> she

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
then set it to the side and then she

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.140 
then set it to the side and then she
would<00:04:40.320> take<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.800> section<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.430> just<00:04:41.910> set<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.060> to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
would take a section and just set it to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.790 
would take a section and just set it to
the<00:04:42.330> side<00:04:42.480> without<00:04:42.720> lightening<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.680> then

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
the side without lightening it and then

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.990 
the side without lightening it and then
she'd<00:04:43.950> pick<00:04:44.070> up<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.310> next<00:04:44.490> section<00:04:44.820> and

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
she'd pick up the next section and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.730 
she'd pick up the next section and
lighten<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.420> so<00:04:45.900> basically<00:04:46.260> she<00:04:46.470> ended<00:04:46.620> up

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
lighten it so basically she ended up

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.680 
lighten it so basically she ended up
leaving<00:04:46.920> some<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.250> my<00:04:47.520> other<00:04:48.180> color<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.660> I

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
leaving some of my other color that I

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.930 
leaving some of my other color that I
had<00:04:48.900> going<00:04:49.140> on<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.160> it's<00:04:50.310> kind<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.700> mix

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
had going on so that it's kind of a mix

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.960 
had going on so that it's kind of a mix
of<00:04:51.210> blonde<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:52.050> my<00:04:52.590> base<00:04:52.830> color<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.820> think

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
of blonde and my base color and I think

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.220 
of blonde and my base color and I think
that's<00:04:54.120> actually<00:04:54.330> really<00:04:54.720> nice<00:04:54.840> because<00:04:54.900> it

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
that's actually really nice because it

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.050 
that's actually really nice because it
ends<00:04:55.440> up<00:04:55.470> looking<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.890> lot<00:04:56.040> more<00:04:56.310> natural<00:04:56.880> and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
ends up looking a lot more natural and

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.020 
ends up looking a lot more natural and
it's<00:04:57.780> not<00:04:57.990> quite<00:04:58.260> as<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:59.130> know<00:04:59.250> chunky<00:04:59.760> as<00:04:59.880> it

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
it's not quite as you know chunky as it

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.790 
it's not quite as you know chunky as it
could<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.480> it's<00:05:00.570> not<00:05:00.630> quite<00:05:00.780> as<00:05:00.960> blocky<00:05:01.350> as

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
could be and it's not quite as blocky as

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.320 
could be and it's not quite as blocky as
it<00:05:02.010> could<00:05:02.160> be<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.370> think<00:05:02.430> she<00:05:02.700> did<00:05:02.850> was<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.150> break

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
it could be I think she did was to break

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.200 
it could be I think she did was to break
up<00:05:03.510> my<00:05:03.660> base<00:05:04.010> because<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.250> actually<00:05:05.550> have<00:05:06.000> all

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
up my base because I actually have all

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.180 
up my base because I actually have all
that<00:05:06.420> roll<00:05:06.750> color<00:05:07.170> right<00:05:07.470> here<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.010> then<00:05:08.160> I

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
that roll color right here and then I

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.730 
that roll color right here and then I
think<00:05:08.610> my<00:05:08.820> my<00:05:09.450> fake<00:05:09.690> color<00:05:10.020> starts<00:05:10.470> around

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
think my my fake color starts around

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.710 
think my my fake color starts around
here<00:05:10.950> somewhere<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:12.120> I've<00:05:12.270> been<00:05:12.360> trying<00:05:12.600> to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
here somewhere and I've been trying to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.990 
here somewhere and I've been trying to
transition<00:05:13.020> back<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.410> my<00:05:13.710> natural<00:05:13.890> color<00:05:14.340> so

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
transition back to my natural color so

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.790 
transition back to my natural color so
what<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.390> did<00:05:15.690> last<00:05:15.870> time<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.170> got<00:05:16.320> my<00:05:16.590> roots

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
what I did last time I got my roots

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.370 
what I did last time I got my roots
retouched<00:05:17.340> was<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:18.270> um<00:05:18.570> kind<00:05:18.600> of<00:05:19.110> find<00:05:19.320> a

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
retouched was to um kind of find a

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.220 
retouched was to um kind of find a
medium<00:05:19.770> color<00:05:20.130> between<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.720> my<00:05:22.020> natural

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
medium color between this and my natural

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.020 
medium color between this and my natural
color<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:22.980> that<00:05:23.010> when<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.400> grew<00:05:23.610> out<00:05:23.640> it

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
color so that when it grew out it

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.220 
color so that when it grew out it
wouldn't<00:05:24.240> be<00:05:24.330> too<00:05:24.540> obvious

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
wouldn't be too obvious

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.780 
wouldn't be too obvious
and<00:05:25.380> we<00:05:25.890> actually<00:05:26.040> did<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.280> really<00:05:26.430> good<00:05:26.670> job

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
and we actually did a really good job

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.160 
and we actually did a really good job
formulating<00:05:27.420> that<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:27.780> that<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:27.990> really

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
formulating that so that you really

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.560 
formulating that so that you really
can't<00:05:28.530> see<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.890> line<00:05:29.100> which<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.520> perfect<00:05:30.000> but

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
can't see that line which is perfect but

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.120 
can't see that line which is perfect but
my<00:05:30.720> roots<00:05:30.900> were<00:05:31.080> just<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.410> little<00:05:31.830> bit<00:05:31.980> darker

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
my roots were just a little bit darker

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.100 
my roots were just a little bit darker
than<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.460> wanted<00:05:32.730> them<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:33.030> be<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.720> was

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
than I wanted them to be so I was

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.570 
than I wanted them to be so I was
talking<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.560> her<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.890> was<00:05:35.010> just<00:05:35.040> like<00:05:35.220> okay

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
talking to her and I was just like okay

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.030 
talking to her and I was just like okay
I<00:05:35.790> don't<00:05:36.300> really<00:05:36.720> want<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:36.990> do<00:05:37.140> color<00:05:37.320> I'll<00:05:37.800> do

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
I don't really want to do color I'll do

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.620 
I don't really want to do color I'll do
color<00:05:38.280> if<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:38.940> feel<00:05:39.120> like<00:05:39.240> that's<00:05:39.420> really

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
color if you feel like that's really

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.050 
color if you feel like that's really
just<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.050> best<00:05:40.320> option<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:41.010> I<00:05:41.520> and<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:42.000> don't

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
just the best option but I and I don't

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.190 
just the best option but I and I don't
really<00:05:42.330> want<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.600> go<00:05:42.720> with<00:05:42.870> my<00:05:42.990> natural

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
really want to go with my natural

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.440 
really want to go with my natural
because<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.800> feel<00:05:43.950> like<00:05:43.980> my<00:05:44.220> natural<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.970> just<00:05:45.330> a

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
because I feel like my natural is just a

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.790 
because I feel like my natural is just a
little<00:05:45.810> bit<00:05:45.930> darker<00:05:46.200> than<00:05:46.230> I<00:05:46.350> want<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.710> be

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
little bit darker than I want it to be

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.660 
little bit darker than I want it to be
and<00:05:46.980> she<00:05:47.130> was<00:05:47.220> like<00:05:47.310> why<00:05:47.400> don't<00:05:47.550> they<00:05:47.640> just

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
and she was like why don't they just

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.030 
and she was like why don't they just
break<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.150> base<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.690> was<00:05:48.810> like<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.980> course

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
break the base and I was like of course

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.640 
break the base and I was like of course
I'm<00:05:50.850> breaking<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.450> bases<00:05:51.810> basically<00:05:52.350> when

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
I'm breaking the bases basically when

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.850 
I'm breaking the bases basically when
you<00:05:53.160> mix<00:05:53.940> Lightner<00:05:54.630> with<00:05:54.840> shampoo<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.530> you

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
you mix Lightner with shampoo and you

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.590 
you mix Lightner with shampoo and you
shampoo<00:05:56.070> it<00:05:56.340> into<00:05:56.580> your<00:05:56.700> hair<00:05:56.880> until<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.450> hair

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
shampoo it into your hair until the hair

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.720 
shampoo it into your hair until the hair
lightens<00:05:57.960> about<00:05:58.170> half<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.530> level<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.070> it<00:05:59.550> just

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
lightens about half a level and it just

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.460 
lightens about half a level and it just
gives<00:05:59.880> it<00:05:59.970> a<00:06:00.060> more<00:06:00.210> sunkissed<00:06:00.720> look<00:06:00.990> it<00:06:01.230> breaks

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
gives it a more sunkissed look it breaks

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.350 
gives it a more sunkissed look it breaks
it<00:06:01.620> up<00:06:01.710> just<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:02.040> little<00:06:02.070> bit<00:06:02.310> so<00:06:02.850> that<00:06:03.150> it's

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
it up just a little bit so that it's

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.970 
it up just a little bit so that it's
just<00:06:03.450> a<00:06:03.630> little<00:06:03.750> bit<00:06:03.960> sunnier<00:06:04.230> it's<00:06:04.620> not<00:06:04.770> quite

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
just a little bit sunnier it's not quite

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.220 
just a little bit sunnier it's not quite
as<00:06:05.130> dark<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.700> it's<00:06:06.480> really<00:06:06.720> really<00:06:06.960> pretty<00:06:07.050> I

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
as dark and it's really really pretty I

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.480 
as dark and it's really really pretty I
actually<00:06:07.650> it's<00:06:07.770> one<00:06:07.890> of<00:06:07.980> my<00:06:08.040> favorite<00:06:08.340> things

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
actually it's one of my favorite things

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.980 
actually it's one of my favorite things
that<00:06:08.580> we<00:06:08.790> did<00:06:09.000> because<00:06:09.300> it<00:06:09.570> really<00:06:09.780> did<00:06:09.960> just

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
that we did because it really did just

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.410 
that we did because it really did just
kind<00:06:10.380> of<00:06:10.410> brighten<00:06:11.190> this<00:06:11.370> whole<00:06:11.580> area<00:06:11.940> up<00:06:12.180> and

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
kind of brighten this whole area up and

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.850 
kind of brighten this whole area up and
it's<00:06:12.960> not<00:06:13.110> going<00:06:13.230> to<00:06:13.290> give<00:06:13.440> you<00:06:13.530> that<00:06:13.680> really

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
it's not going to give you that really

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.530 
it's not going to give you that really
harsh<00:06:14.220> line<00:06:14.490> whenever<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:15.000> hair<00:06:15.150> grows<00:06:15.360> out

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
harsh line whenever the hair grows out

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.870 
harsh line whenever the hair grows out
as<00:06:15.690> well<00:06:15.870> which<00:06:16.050> is<00:06:16.080> really<00:06:16.440> nice<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:17.010> I<00:06:17.340> was

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
as well which is really nice so I was

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.400 
as well which is really nice so I was
really<00:06:18.060> happy<00:06:18.330> with<00:06:18.450> that<00:06:18.690> that<00:06:19.140> definitely

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
really happy with that that definitely

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.630 
really happy with that that definitely
sounds<00:06:19.860> like<00:06:19.890> something<00:06:20.190> that<00:06:20.250> you<00:06:20.340> could<00:06:20.400> do

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
sounds like something that you could do

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.570 
sounds like something that you could do
at<00:06:20.760> home<00:06:20.790> I<00:06:21.150> don't<00:06:21.570> recommend<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.230> think

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
at home I don't recommend it I think

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.520 
at home I don't recommend it I think
playing<00:06:22.879> with<00:06:23.060> bleach<00:06:23.330> at<00:06:23.810> home<00:06:24.139> on<00:06:24.379> your<00:06:24.409> own
