00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
at speed so it comes in this little

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.070 
at speed so it comes in this little
metal<00:01:02.800> tube<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.970> have<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.270> pierce<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.839> top

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
metal tube you have to pierce the top

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.810 
metal tube you have to pierce the top
and<00:01:05.350> order<00:01:05.590> for<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:06.009> product<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.430> come<00:01:06.640> out

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
and order for the product to come out

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.249 
and order for the product to come out
but<00:01:07.420> what<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.630> does<00:01:08.009> it's<00:01:09.009> very<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:10.330> don't<00:01:11.200> know

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
but what it does it's very I don't know

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.749 
but what it does it's very I don't know
it's<00:01:11.410> kind<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.619> thin<00:01:11.920> it's<00:01:12.190> actually<00:01:12.490> thinner

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
it's kind of thin it's actually thinner

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.359 
it's kind of thin it's actually thinner
than<00:01:13.000> even<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.509> white<00:01:13.750> glue<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:15.130> course

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
than even a white glue and of course

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.040 
than even a white glue and of course
it's<00:01:15.580> white<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.149> opaque<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:18.310> does<00:01:18.640> dry<00:01:19.149> clear

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
it's white and opaque it does dry clear

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.840 
it's white and opaque it does dry clear
though<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:20.590> that's<00:01:21.130> at<00:01:21.280> least<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.520> good<00:01:21.640> thing

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
though so that's at least a good thing

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.910 
though so that's at least a good thing
I'm<00:01:22.750> gonna<00:01:22.930> tell<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.229> you're<00:01:23.380> not<00:01:23.500> here<00:01:23.560> with

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
I'm gonna tell you you're not here with

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.760 
I'm gonna tell you you're not here with
me<00:01:23.979> but<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.790> has<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.000> very<00:01:25.450> strong<00:01:25.990> odor<00:01:26.259> of

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
me but this has a very strong odor of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.120 
me but this has a very strong odor of
ammonia<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.899> don't<00:01:29.350> say<00:01:29.590> thing<00:01:29.800> on<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
ammonia so I don't say thing on the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.419 
ammonia so I don't say thing on the
label<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.520> says<00:01:30.670> it's<00:01:31.119> non-toxic<00:01:32.160> so<00:01:33.160> I

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
label that says it's non-toxic so I

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.040 
label that says it's non-toxic so I
would<00:01:33.640> not<00:01:33.789> necessarily<00:01:33.970> use<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.479> with<00:01:34.660> kids

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
would not necessarily use this with kids

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.900 
would not necessarily use this with kids
and<00:01:35.740> actually<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.399> number<00:01:36.640> one<00:01:36.789> ingredient

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
and actually the number one ingredient

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.419 
and actually the number one ingredient
is<00:01:37.300> latex<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.259> if<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.470> have<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> latex<00:01:39.130> allergy

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
is latex so if you have a latex allergy

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.779 
is latex so if you have a latex allergy
you're<00:01:40.300> on<00:01:40.450> alert<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.110> if<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.800> are<00:01:42.039> sensitive

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
you're on alert and if you are sensitive

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.090 
you're on alert and if you are sensitive
to<00:01:42.850> smells<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.780> would<00:01:43.959> not<00:01:44.080> be<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.590> great

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
to smells this would not be a great

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.889 
to smells this would not be a great
product<00:01:45.340> view<00:01:45.580> it's<00:01:45.729> not<00:01:45.789> solvent<00:01:46.360> based<00:01:46.509> but

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
product view it's not solvent based but

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.529 
product view it's not solvent based but
it<00:01:47.020> does<00:01:47.170> have<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.500> ammonia<00:01:47.890> smell<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:49.240> it's

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
it does have that ammonia smell now it's

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.219 
it does have that ammonia smell now it's
interesting<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:50.649> wasn't<00:01:51.190> sure<00:01:51.310> what<00:01:51.399> to<00:01:51.520> expect

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
interesting I wasn't sure what to expect

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.230 
interesting I wasn't sure what to expect
but<00:01:53.229> because<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:54.039> primary<00:01:54.550> ingredient<00:01:55.149> is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
but because the primary ingredient is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.609 
but because the primary ingredient is
latex<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.869> just<00:01:56.050> wanted<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.289> show<00:01:56.410> you<00:01:56.440> what

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
latex I just wanted to show you what

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.650 
latex I just wanted to show you what
happens<00:01:56.979> when<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.220> get<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:57.970> on<00:01:58.060> your<00:01:58.270> hand<00:01:58.539> it

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
happens when you get it on your hand it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.050 
happens when you get it on your hand it
doesn't<00:01:58.899> even<00:01:58.959> really<00:01:59.170> it<00:02:00.130> dries<00:02:00.459> but<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.849> just

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
doesn't even really it dries but it just

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.330 
doesn't even really it dries but it just
kind<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.330> crumbles<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.289> rolls<00:02:03.069> right<00:02:03.280> off

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
kind of crumbles up and rolls right off

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.339 
kind of crumbles up and rolls right off
which<00:02:03.700> makes<00:02:03.940> cleanup<00:02:04.420> really<00:02:04.840> nice<00:02:05.020> because

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
which makes cleanup really nice because

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.309 
which makes cleanup really nice because
it<00:02:06.310> doesn't<00:02:06.490> leave<00:02:06.700> any<00:02:06.729> residue<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:08.020> as

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
it doesn't leave any residue on you as

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.230 
it doesn't leave any residue on you as
you<00:02:08.740> can<00:02:08.890> see<00:02:09.069> here<00:02:09.369> I'm<00:02:09.490> actually<00:02:09.670> using<00:02:10.000> a

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
you can see here I'm actually using a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.530 
you can see here I'm actually using a
craft<00:02:10.539> mat<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:12.310> stays<00:02:12.610> sticky<00:02:13.270> for<00:02:13.450> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
craft mat and it stays sticky for a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.300 
craft mat and it stays sticky for a
while<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.319> know<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.680> put<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> puddle

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
while so you know you can put a puddle

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.670 
while so you know you can put a puddle
here<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:16.450> work<00:02:16.780> with<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.170> after<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:19.680> so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
here and then work with it after that so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.170 
here and then work with it after that so
for<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:20.920> demo<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.610> we're<00:02:21.819> going<00:02:22.000> about

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
for this demo and we're going about

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.089 
for this demo and we're going about
twice<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.510> normal<00:02:23.020> speed<00:02:23.319> I'm<00:02:23.739> actually

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
twice the normal speed I'm actually

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.309 
twice the normal speed I'm actually
using<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.730> repair<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.270> husband's<00:02:25.810> jeans

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
using it to repair my husband's jeans

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.770 
using it to repair my husband's jeans
the<00:02:27.280> belt<00:02:27.520> loop<00:02:27.700> had<00:02:27.880> pulled<00:02:28.150> all<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.660> way

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the belt loop had pulled all the way

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.690 
the belt loop had pulled all the way
through<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.890> thought<00:02:30.160> it'd<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.310> fun<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
through and so I thought it'd be fun to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.910 
through and so I thought it'd be fun to
see<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.180> could<00:02:31.420> actually<00:02:31.630> get<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.230> speed<00:02:32.590> so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
see if I could actually get the speed so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.350 
see if I could actually get the speed so
to<00:02:33.670> fix<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.540> belt<00:02:34.840> loops<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:36.060> we'll<00:02:37.060> see<00:02:37.240> what

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
to fix the belt loops and we'll see what

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.330 
to fix the belt loops and we'll see what
happens

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.940 

okay<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.400> um<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.590> speed-sew<00:02:47.160> has<00:02:47.430> dried<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.950> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
okay so um the speed-sew has dried and I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.890 
okay so um the speed-sew has dried and I
just<00:02:50.490> want<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> show<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.880> put<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.570> maybe<00:02:51.780> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
just want to show you put on maybe a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.200 
just want to show you put on maybe a
little<00:02:52.020> too<00:02:52.260> much<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> kind<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.860> went<00:02:53.070> through

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
little too much it kind of went through

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.900 
little too much it kind of went through
the<00:02:54.210> hole<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:58.250> mean<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.490> looks<00:02:59.670> really

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
the hole here but I mean it looks really

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.180 
the hole here but I mean it looks really
sturdy<00:03:03.290> we'll<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:04.980> actually

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
sturdy we'll just have to like actually

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.750 
sturdy we'll just have to like actually
try<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:07.110> how<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.320> does

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
try it out and see how it does

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.470 
try it out and see how it does
as<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> little<00:03:09.800> fox<00:03:11.360> everything<00:03:12.360> is

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
as for the little fox everything is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.940 
as for the little fox everything is
dried<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.990> it's<00:03:13.110> gone<00:03:13.320> clear<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:15.890> I'm<00:03:16.890> not

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
dried and it's gone clear and I'm not

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.980 
dried and it's gone clear and I'm not
sure<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> holds<00:03:17.640> together<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.390> ollie<00:03:18.660> fin

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
sure it holds together the ollie fin

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.800 
sure it holds together the ollie fin
real<00:03:19.200> well<00:03:20.000> as<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.240> just<00:03:21.480> pull<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> right

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
real well as I can just pull it right

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:30.980 
real well as I can just pull it right
apart<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> next<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.980> sample<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.990> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
apart so next I have the sample of the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.740 
apart so next I have the sample of the
t-con<00:03:31.470> t-shirt<00:03:31.860> fabric<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:33.030> knit

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
t-con t-shirt fabric so this is a knit

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.120 
t-con t-shirt fabric so this is a knit
with<00:03:34.230> cotton<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:36.650> I'm<00:03:37.650> pulling<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.950> as

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
with cotton and I'm pulling it and as

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.860 
with cotton and I'm pulling it and as
you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:41.850> pulling<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.570> little<00:03:42.750> bit

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
you can see it's pulling a little bit

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.800 
you can see it's pulling a little bit
but<00:03:43.320> um<00:03:44.660> it's<00:03:45.660> definitely<00:03:45.810> not<00:03:46.170> coming<00:03:46.440> up

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.470 

and<00:03:52.730> as<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.209> t-shirt<00:03:54.900> bag<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.240> see

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and as for the t-shirt bag you can see

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.330 
and as for the t-shirt bag you can see
here<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.140> where<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.500> seeped<00:03:58.830> through<00:03:58.980> it

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
here that it where it seeped through it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.630 
here that it where it seeped through it
did<00:03:59.580> change<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.120> color<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.480> little<00:04:00.630> bit<00:04:01.640> it

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
did change the color a little bit it

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.460 
did change the color a little bit it
kind<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.240> a<00:04:03.270> darker<00:04:03.750> pink<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.290> can

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
kind of is a darker pink so you can

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.240 
kind of is a darker pink so you can
definitely<00:04:04.620> see<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.709> I'm<00:04:10.800> pulling<00:04:11.130> on

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
definitely see it but I'm pulling on

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.909 
definitely see it but I'm pulling on
this<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.819> hard<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:12.959> not<00:04:14.330> budging

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
this really hard and it is not budging

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.650 
this really hard and it is not budging
so<00:04:16.919> I'll<00:04:17.310> wash<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.549> few<00:04:17.880> samples<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.450> see<00:04:18.540> what

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
so I'll wash a few samples and see what

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:29.290 
so I'll wash a few samples and see what
happens<00:04:18.930> next

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.920 

okay<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:30.750> two<00:04:31.139> days<00:04:31.380> later<00:04:31.770> now<00:04:32.130> and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
okay so this is two days later now and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.629 
okay so this is two days later now and
while<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.110> belt<00:04:34.290> loop<00:04:34.470> seemed<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.919> hold<00:04:35.130> very

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
while the belt loop seemed to hold very

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.700 
while the belt loop seemed to hold very
well<00:04:35.669> initially<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.570> just<00:04:36.930> gave<00:04:37.350> him<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.560> good

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
well initially I just gave him a good

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.159 
well initially I just gave him a good
hearty<00:04:37.980> tug<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.580> they've<00:04:39.540> pulled<00:04:39.930> right<00:04:40.110> back

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
hearty tug and they've pulled right back

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.770 
hearty tug and they've pulled right back
out<00:04:40.470> again<00:04:40.639> so<00:04:41.639> this<00:04:42.030> might<00:04:42.180> be<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.360> short-term

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
out again so this might be a short-term

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.780 
out again so this might be a short-term
repair<00:04:43.350> for<00:04:43.590> denim<00:04:43.889> but<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.130> certainly<00:04:44.520> isn't

going to showed you I glued it on a day
or<00:04:52.020> two<00:04:52.200> ago<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:52.800> now<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.639> gave<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.240> good

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
or two ago and just now I gave it a good

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.050 
or two ago and just now I gave it a good
hearty<00:04:54.690> tug<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.260> you<00:04:55.770> can<00:04:55.889> see<00:04:56.100> all<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.820> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
hearty tug and you can see all of the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.050 
hearty tug and you can see all of the
latex<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:59.550> did<00:04:59.730> not<00:04:59.850> hold

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
latex is here and it did not hold

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.230 
latex is here and it did not hold
permanently<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.110> now<00:05:01.500> we<00:05:01.560> know<00:05:02.000> here's<00:05:03.000> my

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
permanently so now we know here's my

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.290 
permanently so now we know here's my
sample<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.290> cotton<00:05:05.100> fabric<00:05:05.280> on<00:05:05.669> top<00:05:06.000> of

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
sample of the cotton fabric on top of

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300 
sample of the cotton fabric on top of
the<00:05:06.479> knit<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.050> it's<00:05:07.740> been<00:05:07.889> run<00:05:08.070> through<00:05:08.100> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
the knit and it's been run through the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.670 
the knit and it's been run through the
washer<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:08.790> the<00:05:09.060> dryer<00:05:09.150> on<00:05:09.600> medium<00:05:10.050> heat<00:05:10.470> now

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
washer and the dryer on medium heat now

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.590 
washer and the dryer on medium heat now
I<00:05:11.010> just<00:05:11.610> want<00:05:11.790> you<00:05:11.880> know<00:05:11.970> that<00:05:12.090> when<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.240> got<00:05:12.479> it

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
I just want you know that when I got it

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.000 
I just want you know that when I got it
out<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.870> dryer<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.320> actually<00:05:13.770> kind<00:05:13.950> of

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
out of the dryer is actually kind of

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.520 
out of the dryer is actually kind of
stuck<00:05:14.370> together<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:15.090> now<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.960> I'm<00:05:16.080> feeling

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
stuck together and now that I'm feeling

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.310 
stuck together and now that I'm feeling
it<00:05:16.650> what<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.800> realize<00:05:17.310> is<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.850> some<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.630> the

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
it what I realize is that some of the

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.950 
it what I realize is that some of the
speed<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:19.979> seeped<00:05:20.940> up<00:05:21.210> through<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.690> cotton

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
speed so seeped up through the cotton

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.180 
speed so seeped up through the cotton
and<00:05:23.479> so<00:05:24.479> now<00:05:24.630> it's<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.930> little<00:05:25.169> rubbery<00:05:25.620> on<00:05:25.860> top

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
and so now it's a little rubbery on top

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.110 
and so now it's a little rubbery on top
it<00:05:26.550> actually<00:05:27.180> feels<00:05:27.360> like<00:05:27.479> a<00:05:27.600> little<00:05:27.960> sticky

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
it actually feels like a little sticky

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.050 
it actually feels like a little sticky
which<00:05:30.120> just<00:05:30.419> is<00:05:30.660> not<00:05:31.520> completely<00:05:32.520> good<00:05:32.789> I

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
which just is not completely good I

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.490 
which just is not completely good I
probably<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.630> don't<00:05:33.750> know<00:05:33.870> if<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.080> was<00:05:34.229> just<00:05:34.350> not

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
probably I don't know if I was just not

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.620 
probably I don't know if I was just not
careful<00:05:35.010> in<00:05:35.070> my<00:05:35.160> application<00:05:35.340> or<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.180> put<00:05:36.450> too

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
careful in my application or I put too

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.080 
careful in my application or I put too
much<00:05:36.660> on<00:05:36.930> but<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:37.979> can<00:05:38.130> actually<00:05:38.280> even<00:05:38.550> see

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
much on but you can actually even see

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.320 
much on but you can actually even see
that<00:05:39.390> little<00:05:39.600> shadow<00:05:39.960> of<00:05:40.200> it<00:05:40.320> right<00:05:40.590> here<00:05:41.330> in

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
that little shadow of it right here in

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.940 
that little shadow of it right here in
any<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:43.020> it<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.140> just<00:05:43.380> wanted<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.650> let<00:05:43.740> you<00:05:43.800> know

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
any of it I just wanted to let you know

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.890 
any of it I just wanted to let you know
that<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:44.640> be<00:05:44.910> careful<00:05:45.390> not<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.690> apply<00:05:45.750> too

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
that you be careful not to apply too

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.680 
that you be careful not to apply too
much<00:05:46.080> material<00:05:46.650> otherwise<00:05:46.890> it<00:05:47.760> will<00:05:48.000> seep<00:05:48.450> up

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
much material otherwise it will seep up

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.770 
much material otherwise it will seep up
through<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.560> fibers<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:50.539> leave<00:05:51.539> you<00:05:51.630> with<00:05:51.660> a

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
through the fibers and leave you with a

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.930 
through the fibers and leave you with a
slightly<00:05:52.080> rubberized<00:05:52.710> sticky<00:05:53.430> surface<00:05:53.760> which

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
slightly rubberized sticky surface which

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.850 
slightly rubberized sticky surface which
would<00:05:54.120> be<00:05:54.270> great<00:05:54.390> on<00:05:54.630> socks<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.289> maybe<00:05:55.470> not<00:05:55.650> so

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
would be great on socks but maybe not so

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.820 
would be great on socks but maybe not so
good<00:05:56.039> on<00:05:56.070> an<00:05:56.280> applique<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.810> now<00:05:58.139> here's<00:05:58.620> the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
good on an applique and now here's the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.450 
good on an applique and now here's the
bottom<00:05:59.250> of<00:05:59.550> the<00:06:00.330> t-shirt<00:06:00.960> bag<00:06:01.260> that<00:06:01.470> I<00:06:01.530> made<00:06:01.740> it

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
bottom of the t-shirt bag that I made it

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.340 
bottom of the t-shirt bag that I made it
has<00:06:02.639> also<00:06:02.850> been<00:06:03.090> washed<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.539> dried<00:06:03.600> on<00:06:03.900> medium

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
has also been washed and dried on medium

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.860 
has also been washed and dried on medium
and<00:06:04.970> again<00:06:05.970> you<00:06:06.120> can<00:06:06.240> kind<00:06:06.360> of<00:06:06.479> see<00:06:06.660> that

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
and again you can kind of see that

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.140 
and again you can kind of see that
little<00:06:07.080> area<00:06:07.410> where<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:08.160> speedos<00:06:08.760> soaked

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
little area where the speedos soaked

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.480 
little area where the speedos soaked
through<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.690> knit<00:06:09.979> because<00:06:10.979> I<00:06:11.070> wasn't

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
through the knit because I wasn't

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.800 
through the knit because I wasn't
careful<00:06:11.669> in<00:06:11.910> applying<00:06:12.180> that<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.360> just<00:06:12.630> kind<00:06:12.780> of

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
careful in applying that I just kind of

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.770 
careful in applying that I just kind of
blocked<00:06:13.139> it<00:06:13.320> on<00:06:14.120> but<00:06:15.120> I<00:06:15.150> just<00:06:15.389> wanted<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:15.660> show

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
blocked it on but I just wanted to show

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.180 
blocked it on but I just wanted to show
you<00:06:15.870> that<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:16.110> hold<00:06:16.380> still<00:06:16.800> seems<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.130> be

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
you that the hold still seems to be

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.080 
you that the hold still seems to be
pretty<00:06:17.460> good

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
pretty good

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.390 
pretty good
then<00:06:18.990> even<00:06:19.260> through<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.800> washing<00:06:20.220> and<00:06:20.340> the

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
then even through the washing and the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.279 
then even through the washing and the
drying<00:06:20.610> process<00:06:23.600> heard<00:06:24.600> a<00:06:24.660> little<00:06:24.780> cracking

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
drying process heard a little cracking

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:30.320 
drying process heard a little cracking
there<00:06:25.470> about<00:06:25.950> letting<00:06:26.250> go<00:06:28.700> and<00:06:29.700> I<00:06:29.970> feel<00:06:30.180> like

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
there about letting go and I feel like

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.110 
there about letting go and I feel like
if<00:06:30.450> I<00:06:30.539> wanted<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.169> make<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:31.919> if<00:06:32.669> I<00:06:32.760> wanted<00:06:33.060> to

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
if I wanted to make it if I wanted to

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.520 
if I wanted to make it if I wanted to
rip<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.360> apart<00:06:33.450> I<00:06:33.840> probably<00:06:34.110> would<00:06:34.289> just<00:06:34.410> have

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
rip it apart I probably would just have

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.610 
rip it apart I probably would just have
to<00:06:34.620> like<00:06:34.770> kind<00:06:35.490> of<00:06:35.550> systemically<00:06:36.419> just<00:06:37.409> keep

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
to like kind of systemically just keep

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.060 
to like kind of systemically just keep
pulling<00:06:38.039> at<00:06:38.190> it<00:06:39.200> right<00:06:40.200> here<00:06:40.260> you<00:06:40.440> can<00:06:40.680> see<00:06:40.860> how

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
pulling at it right here you can see how

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.980 
pulling at it right here you can see how
when<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.550> pull

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
when I pull

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.780 
when I pull
you<00:06:43.380> can<00:06:43.530> see<00:06:43.740> the<00:06:43.860> latex<00:06:44.250> start<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.550> stretch

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
you can see the latex start to stretch

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.310 
you can see the latex start to stretch
and<00:06:45.000> then<00:06:45.090> let<00:06:45.240> go<00:06:45.449> so<00:06:45.660> it's<00:06:45.780> kind<00:06:45.990> of<00:06:46.020> like<00:06:46.199> a

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
and then let go so it's kind of like a

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.189 
and then let go so it's kind of like a
rubber<00:06:46.590> band<00:06:47.210> in<00:06:48.210> that<00:06:48.449> it'll<00:06:48.720> stretch<00:06:48.990> it'll

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
rubber band in that it'll stretch it'll

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.719 
rubber band in that it'll stretch it'll
stretch<00:06:49.410> will<00:06:49.530> stretch<00:06:49.770> and<00:06:49.979> then<00:06:50.070> finally<00:06:50.460> it

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
stretch will stretch and then finally it

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.080 
stretch will stretch and then finally it
just<00:06:51.090> will<00:06:51.660> let<00:06:52.650> go<00:06:52.889> so<00:06:53.550> these<00:06:53.790> are<00:06:53.970> all

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
just will let go so these are all

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.790 
just will let go so these are all
important<00:06:54.449> things<00:06:54.630> to<00:06:54.840> note<00:06:54.990> before<00:06:55.260> you<00:06:55.620> try

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
important things to note before you try

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.530 
important things to note before you try
and<00:06:55.919> do<00:06:55.979> a<00:06:56.010> project<00:06:56.280> it<00:06:56.669> speeds<00:06:56.910> up

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.450 

all<00:07:01.540> right<00:07:02.200> so<00:07:02.470> at<00:07:02.560> the<00:07:02.680> end<00:07:02.860> of<00:07:03.010> the<00:07:03.070> day<00:07:03.220> I'm

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
all right so at the end of the day I'm

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.000 
all right so at the end of the day I'm
kind<00:07:03.790> of<00:07:03.880> torn<00:07:04.180> about<00:07:04.330> speed<00:07:04.750> so<00:07:04.990> I<00:07:05.260> think<00:07:05.890> it's

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
kind of torn about speed so I think it's

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.130 
kind of torn about speed so I think it's
really<00:07:06.190> good<00:07:06.490> for<00:07:06.520> short-term<00:07:07.270> quick<00:07:07.900> grab

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.140 
really good for short-term quick grab

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.830 
really good for short-term quick grab
things<00:07:08.550> but<00:07:09.550> I'm<00:07:09.820> really<00:07:10.060> not<00:07:10.300> convinced<00:07:10.780> that

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
things but I'm really not convinced that

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.960 
things but I'm really not convinced that
in<00:07:11.020> the<00:07:11.140> long<00:07:11.410> run<00:07:11.770> it's<00:07:12.040> going<00:07:12.430> to<00:07:12.550> have<00:07:12.730> much

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
in the long run it's going to have much

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.660 
in the long run it's going to have much
staying<00:07:13.390> power<00:07:13.890> now<00:07:14.890> I<00:07:14.920> know<00:07:15.070> that<00:07:15.370> this<00:07:15.460> is<00:07:15.640> a

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
staying power now I know that this is a

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.160

product that has been used a lot for

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.460 
product that has been used a lot for
