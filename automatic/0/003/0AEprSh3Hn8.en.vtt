00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.679
 Ducati engineers have been able to expand the boundaries of sports 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.360
 motorcycle with a two-cylinder engine, creating a model 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:36.280
 Panigale R. 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.280
 The main feature of the engine - titanium connecting rods and lightweight 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.329
 flywheel, thanks to which the weight of the engine was successful 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.020
 reduce by one and a half kilograms. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.329
 And in the valve control system, designers first applied 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.379
 ultra slippery DLC coating. 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.720
 All this positively influenced the characteristics of one 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.930
 of the most powerful engines in the world - Superquadro. 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.219
 After upgrading, he began to produce 195 horsepower, 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.210
 and the upper threshold of speed reached 12 thousand per minute. 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.770
 The motor without the slightest delay responds to pressing a button 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 launch. 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890
 Coupling in an oil bath according to its characteristics 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.450
 surpasses the previous generation, although it does not publish 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.710
 characteristic clatter sound. 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.460
 If necessary, you can shift gears without clutch, 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.500
 This allows you to make an electronic quickshift. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.110
 Ohlins adjustable suspension has previously been applied and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 on other Ducati models. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.130
 But on the Panigale R model, it is modified, and allows you to deflect the angle 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.659
 tilt pendulum depending on road conditions. 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.530
 Driving a motorcycle on a winding road or, 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.000
 passing a series of turns, one of the difficult tests 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.250
 for the rider, but not on the Panigale R. 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 Possessing a curb weight of just over 200 kilograms 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.560
 and the rigid aluminum monocoque frame, is one of the most 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.649
 light motorcycles in its class. 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.180
 In addition, forged models are installed on this Ducati model. 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.759
 rims Marquezini - they allowed for one kilogram 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.710
 reduce unsprung masses and raise even higher 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.820
 manageability indicators. 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 According to the reviews of professional racers Ducati Panigale R - excellent 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 motorcycle. 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.189
 It is faster and more dynamic than its predecessors, 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.690
 and installed on it a new electronic filling 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.480
 instantly responds to changing road conditions 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.730
 and sets the appropriate algorithm for all systems. 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.349
 However, despite the abundance of gadgets cope 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.870
 with a powerful and aggressive sportbike only 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.200
 experienced athletes. 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.890
 If you are one of them, you have the opportunity to experience 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.200
 the sensations that only Ducati Panigale R. can give
