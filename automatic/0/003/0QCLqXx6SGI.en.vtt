okay<00:00:02.159> what<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.520> have<00:00:02.700> here<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.060> Chrysler<00:00:03.540> in

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
okay what we have here is a Chrysler in

and<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> did<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.750> basically<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.290> just

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and what I did is I basically I just

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.720 
and what I did is I basically I just
took<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.070> top<00:00:11.519> off<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
took the top off of it here we have the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.039 
took the top off of it here we have the
three<00:00:14.730> wire<00:00:14.910> where<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> three<00:00:15.540> wire<00:00:15.690> plug

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
three wire where the three wire plug

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.710 
three wire where the three wire plug
goes<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> common<00:00:17.970> ground<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.420> both

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
goes in one is a common ground for both

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
goes in one is a common ground for both
the<00:00:18.960> switch<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> solenoid<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.609> other<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the switch and solenoid the other is a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
the switch and solenoid the other is a
wire<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.660> powers<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.529> solenoid<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
wire that powers up the solenoid and the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
wire that powers up the solenoid and the
other<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> sense<00:00:24.390> wire<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.140> PCM

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
other is a sense wire that the PCM

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.790 
other is a sense wire that the PCM
supply<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.039> either<00:00:26.250> 12<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:26.880> 5<00:00:27.689> volts<00:00:28.230> too<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
supply is either 12 or 5 volts too and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.550 
supply is either 12 or 5 volts too and
when<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> switch<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> top<00:00:31.080> part<00:00:31.410> here

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
when the switch and the top part here

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.979 
when the switch and the top part here
closes<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.759> five<00:00:33.030> volts<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.570> drop<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> zero

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
closes that five volts will drop to zero

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
closes that five volts will drop to zero
and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.010> PCM<00:00:35.520> will<00:00:35.760> read<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:38.149> zero<00:00:39.149> as

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and the PCM will read that as zero as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
and the PCM will read that as zero as
zero<00:00:39.750> volts<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.649> sense<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
zero volts and will sense then that the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060 
zero volts and will sense then that the
switch<00:00:41.760> has<00:00:42.000> closed<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.829> little

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
switch has closed and just a little

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.090 
switch has closed and just a little
explanation<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.360> works<00:00:46.100> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
explanation here of how this works this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760 
explanation here of how this works this
year<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:48.030> ports<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.379> port

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
year we have two ports on here this port

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.380 
year we have two ports on here this port
here<00:00:50.300> goes<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.980> goes<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> vent<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
here goes to the goes to the vent is the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.209 
here goes to the goes to the vent is the
vent<00:00:54.600> port<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.110> goes<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> filter<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
vent port and goes up to the filter to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
vent port and goes up to the filter to
keep<00:00:56.399> dirt<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.850> till<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> year<00:00:57.750> we're

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
keep dirt out till the year we're

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
keep dirt out till the year we're
normally<00:00:58.920> during<00:00:59.100> purge<00:00:59.430> cycle<00:00:59.699> what<00:01:00.059> enters

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
normally during purge cycle what enters

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
normally during purge cycle what enters
through<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.829> our<00:01:01.980> other<00:01:02.070> vent

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
through there and then our other vent

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.780 
through there and then our other vent
our<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:03.059> port<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.539> goes<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> canister

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
our other port here goes to the canister

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
our other port here goes to the canister
which<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> air<00:01:06.090> flows<00:01:06.390> through<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
which the air flows through here and to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
which the air flows through here and to
the<00:01:07.770> canister<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.549> during<00:01:08.880> purge<00:01:09.150> fresh<00:01:09.930> air

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the canister so during purge fresh air

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
the canister so during purge fresh air
can<00:01:10.350> enter<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> canister<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> air<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
can enter the canister as the air in the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.830 
can enter the canister as the air in the
canister<00:01:13.049> gets<00:01:13.229> purged<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.689> into<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
canister gets purged into the into the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
canister gets purged into the into the
engine<00:01:16.460> okay<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.240> brief

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
engine okay and then just a brief

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
engine okay and then just a brief
explanation<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> selenite

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
explanation here of the selenite

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.780 
explanation here of the selenite
assemblies<00:01:20.580> normally<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.790> as

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
assemblies normally when this as is as

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.499 
assemblies normally when this as is as
the<00:01:24.240> env<00:01:24.540> LD<00:01:24.840> sits<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.040> system<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> closed<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the env LD sits the system is closed to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.100 
the env LD sits the system is closed to
the<00:01:27.630> atmosphere<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:29.310> happens<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
the atmosphere so what happens when the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.490 
the atmosphere so what happens when the
after<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> shut<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.530> car<00:01:31.740> off<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:33.290> fuel<00:01:34.290> in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
after you shut your car off the fuel in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.149 
after you shut your car off the fuel in
the<00:01:34.530> tank<00:01:35.659> supposedly<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.990> cool<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the tank supposedly will cool and as it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.880 
the tank supposedly will cool and as it
cools<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> contracts<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:40.200> contraction

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
cools it contracts and that contraction

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.780 
cools it contracts and that contraction
will<00:01:41.820> draw<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> diaphragm<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
will draw this diaphragm here and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.719 
will draw this diaphragm here and
underneath<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.060> dry<00:01:45.329> diaphragm<00:01:46.520> there<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
underneath is dry diaphragm there is a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.690 
underneath is dry diaphragm there is a
micro<00:01:48.509> switch<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.740> has<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> vacuum

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
micro switch and as it has the vacuum

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.950 
micro switch and as it has the vacuum
and<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.600> tank<00:01:51.869> increases<00:01:52.790> this<00:01:53.960> diaphragm

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and the tank increases this diaphragm

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
and the tank increases this diaphragm
here<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.500> push<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> switch<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
here will push on the switch and that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
here will push on the switch and that
closes<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.360> contacts<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
closes the contacts in there and that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
closes the contacts in there and that
will<00:01:59.100> drop<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.549> voltage<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.299> zero<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> PCM

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
will drop the voltage to zero so the PCM

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.770 
will drop the voltage to zero so the PCM
can<00:02:01.560> read<00:02:01.740> zero<00:02:02.549> voltage<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> switch

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
can read zero voltage that the switch

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.910 
can read zero voltage that the switch
has<00:02:04.020> closed<00:02:04.610> okay<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.619> part

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
has closed okay and then the other part

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.389 
has closed okay and then the other part
is<00:02:08.129> the

is closed so that there is vacuum in the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.339 
is closed so that there is vacuum in the
in<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.640> system<00:02:22.090> when<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> solenoid<00:02:23.049> is

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
in the system when a solenoid is

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.440 
in the system when a solenoid is
activated<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.340> pushes<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.030> plunger<00:02:25.420> down

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450

here and the purpose for that is to for

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.839 
here and the purpose for that is to for
a<00:02:34.510> check<00:02:34.930> system<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:36.069> if<00:02:36.220> once<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.519> start

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
a check system because if once you start

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.509 
a check system because if once you start
your<00:02:36.939> vehicle<00:02:37.150> up<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:38.650> there<00:02:39.310> will<00:02:39.489> be

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
your vehicle up your there will be

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.819 
your vehicle up your there will be
vacuum<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.299> tank<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.810> often<00:02:41.409> notice<00:02:41.590> this

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
vacuum in the tank you often notice this

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.530 
vacuum in the tank you often notice this
when<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.099> take<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> gas<00:02:42.579> cap<00:02:42.819> off<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.239> can<00:02:43.389> hear

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
when you take a gas cap off you can hear

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.780 
when you take a gas cap off you can hear
it<00:02:43.659> sucking<00:02:44.019> you'll<00:02:44.739> hear<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> sucking<00:02:45.489> sound

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
it sucking you'll hear a sucking sound

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.280 
it sucking you'll hear a sucking sound
or<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.200> purge<00:02:47.200> sound<00:02:47.620> one<00:02:47.889> of<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> other

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
or a purge sound one of one or the other

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.920 
or a purge sound one of one or the other
so<00:02:50.290> when<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.500> start<00:02:51.010> your<00:02:51.099> car<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.849> PCM<00:02:52.780> will

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
so when you start your car the PCM will

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.050 
so when you start your car the PCM will
open<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.319> solenoid<00:02:53.620> which<00:02:54.430> will<00:02:54.609> release<00:02:54.879> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
open a solenoid which will release the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.849 
open a solenoid which will release the
vacuum<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.689> then<00:02:56.019> it<00:02:56.170> knows<00:02:56.349> from<00:02:56.650> there

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
vacuum and then it knows from there

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.890 
vacuum and then it knows from there
because<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.819> vacuum<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.329> released<00:02:58.689> this

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
because the vacuum is released this

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.140 
because the vacuum is released this
micro<00:02:59.349> switch<00:02:59.620> will<00:02:59.889> switch<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.909> off

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
micro switch will switch to the off

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.059 
micro switch will switch to the off
position<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.170> diaphragm<00:03:02.470> as<00:03:02.859> the

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
position in the diaphragm as the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.740 
position in the diaphragm as the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
pressure from behind there is released

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.660 
pressure from behind there is released
okay<00:03:05.409> and<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.739> always<00:03:05.920> thought<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.400> there<00:03:06.579> is

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
okay and I always thought that there is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.059 
okay and I always thought that there is
a<00:03:06.700> relationship<00:03:07.239> between<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.989> switch<00:03:08.319> and

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
a relationship between the switch and

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.129 
a relationship between the switch and
when<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.340> activate<00:03:09.879> the<00:03:10.120> solenoid<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:10.870> there

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
when you activate the solenoid but there

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.020 
when you activate the solenoid but there
really<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.530> no<00:03:11.709> relationship<00:03:12.519> when<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.760> do<00:03:12.879> to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
really is no relationship when you do to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.210 
really is no relationship when you do to

you<00:04:12.010> get<00:04:12.190> for<00:04:12.400> if<00:04:12.519> you<00:04:12.699> have<00:04:12.819> pressure<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.389> your

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
you get for if you have pressure in your

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.249 
you get for if you have pressure in your
tank<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.799> opposite<00:04:15.280> will<00:04:15.430> happen

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
tank just the opposite will happen

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.289 
tank just the opposite will happen
normally<00:04:17.259> this<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.799> closed<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.759> pressure<00:04:19.060> in

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
normally this is closed so pressure in

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.080 
normally this is closed so pressure in
here<00:04:19.509> would<00:04:19.840> be<00:04:19.989> pushing<00:04:20.259> up<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.789> relief

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
here would be pushing up on the relief

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.210 
here would be pushing up on the relief
valve<00:04:22.120> which<00:04:22.960> would<00:04:23.259> then<00:04:23.440> pressurize<00:04:24.039> your

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
valve which would then pressurize your

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.740 
valve which would then pressurize your
tank<00:04:24.460> well<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.789> don't<00:04:24.940> want<00:04:25.090> too<00:04:25.630> much

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
tank well you don't want too much

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.110 
tank well you don't want too much
pressure<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.289> your<00:04:26.319> tank<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.949> you<00:04:27.849> don't<00:04:28.000> want

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
pressure in your tank and you don't want

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.570 
pressure in your tank and you don't want
to<00:04:28.210> blow<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.479> gas<00:04:28.660> cap<00:04:28.960> off<00:04:29.199> obviously<00:04:29.580> so

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
to blow the gas cap off obviously so

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.210 
to blow the gas cap off obviously so
what<00:04:30.699> happens<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.599> pressure<00:04:31.979> also<00:04:32.979> goes

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
what happens is that pressure also goes

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.580 
what happens is that pressure also goes
up<00:04:33.490> through<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.000> where<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.080> electrical

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
up through the where the electrical

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.860 
up through the where the electrical
connections<00:04:36.310> is<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.669> because<00:04:37.270> this<00:04:37.449> here's<00:04:37.720> a

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
connections is and because this here's a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.040 
connections is and because this here's a
larger<00:04:38.319> surface<00:04:38.770> area<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.970> this<00:04:40.210> here<00:04:40.479> even

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
larger surface area and this here even

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.390 
larger surface area and this here even
though<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.199> have<00:04:41.470> equal<00:04:41.770> pressure<00:04:41.979> on<00:04:42.250> both

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
though you have equal pressure on both

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.180 
though you have equal pressure on both
sides<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:42.970> larger<00:04:43.300> surface<00:04:43.509> area<00:04:44.050> will<00:04:44.979> push

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
sides the larger surface area will push

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.370 
sides the larger surface area will push
down<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.759> this<00:04:46.240> here<00:04:46.509> will<00:04:46.660> then<00:04:46.840> act<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.349> a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
down and this here will then act as a

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.860 
down and this here will then act as a
relief<00:04:47.740> valve<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.970> relieve<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.419> pressure<00:04:49.570> in

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
relief valve to relieve the pressure in

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.689 
relief valve to relieve the pressure in
the<00:04:49.960> tank<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.410> you're<00:04:50.500> just<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.310> because

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
the tank and you're just and because

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.219 
the tank and you're just and because
this<00:04:51.880> here<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.180> hooked<00:04:52.330> up<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.720> canister

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
this here is hooked up to the canister

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.800 
this here is hooked up to the canister
the<00:04:53.410> pressure<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.919> tank<00:04:54.270> air<00:04:55.270> that's<00:04:55.599> in

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
the pressure in the tank air that's in

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.510 
the pressure in the tank air that's in
the<00:04:55.840> tank<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.440> being<00:04:56.710> filtered<00:04:56.979> through<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
the tank is being filtered through the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.960 
the tank is being filtered through the
canister<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:59.349> air<00:04:59.530> that<00:05:00.099> exits<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
canister so that the air that exits the

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.960 
canister so that the air that exits the
on<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.930> vent<00:05:02.139> side<00:05:02.440> here<00:05:02.830> is<00:05:03.430> actually

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
on the vent side here is actually

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.790 
on the vent side here is actually
filtered<00:05:04.419> air<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.870> should<00:05:05.289> not<00:05:05.440> have<00:05:05.650> that

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
filtered air and should not have that

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.279 
filtered air and should not have that
many<00:05:05.979> hard<00:05:06.250> hydrocarbons<00:05:07.120> in<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.419> that<00:05:08.110> should

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
many hard hydrocarbons in it that should

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.899 
many hard hydrocarbons in it that should
all<00:05:08.470> been<00:05:08.650> captured<00:05:08.860> in<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.370> canister

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
all been captured in the canister

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.570 
all been captured in the canister
hopefully<00:05:10.690> this<00:05:10.840> will<00:05:10.990> help<00:05:11.349> explain<00:05:12.250> here<00:05:12.550> a

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
hopefully this will help explain here a

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.640 
hopefully this will help explain here a
little<00:05:12.759> bit<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.120> how<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.449> work<00:05:13.659> the<00:05:14.349> largely

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
little bit of how this work the largely

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.529 
little bit of how this work the largely
test<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.460> little<00:05:15.550> different<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.300> largely

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
test is a little different the largely

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.670 
test is a little different the largely
weak<00:05:17.199> test<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:18.819> PCM<00:05:19.419> just<00:05:19.780> activates<00:05:20.470> the

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
weak test the PCM just activates the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.110 
weak test the PCM just activates the
purge<00:05:20.889> solenoid<00:05:21.159> and<00:05:21.759> in<00:05:22.360> watches<00:05:22.840> for<00:05:23.110> the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
purge solenoid and in watches for the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.149 
purge solenoid and in watches for the
watches<00:05:25.120> for<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.360> vacuum<00:05:25.599> increase<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.530> then

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
watches for a vacuum increase and then

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.490 
watches for a vacuum increase and then
sees<00:05:27.460> how<00:05:27.729> long<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.449> vacuum<00:05:28.990> will<00:05:29.259> last

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
sees how long that vacuum will last

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.100 
sees how long that vacuum will last
until<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:30.550> diaphragm<00:05:31.090> is<00:05:31.300> released<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:31.990> it's

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
until the diaphragm is released so it's

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.290 
until the diaphragm is released so it's
just<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.469> bleed<00:05:32.710> off<00:05:32.889> a<00:05:33.190> matter<00:05:33.849> of<00:05:33.969> how<00:05:34.120> much

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
just a bleed off a matter of how much

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.010 
just a bleed off a matter of how much
time<00:05:34.509> it<00:05:34.570> takes<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.080> bleed<00:05:35.289> off<00:05:35.500> to<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:37.780> allow

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
time it takes to bleed off to to allow

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.089 
time it takes to bleed off to to allow
the<00:05:38.699> to<00:05:39.699> allow<00:05:39.969> the<00:05:40.830> diaphragm<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:41.860> be

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
the to allow the diaphragm to be

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.270 
the to allow the diaphragm to be
released<00:05:42.460> here<00:05:42.789> so<00:05:43.680> that's<00:05:44.680> about<00:05:44.949> it<00:05:45.099> for

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
released here so that's about it for

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.730 
released here so that's about it for
this<00:05:45.550> video<00:05:45.729> I<00:05:45.940> guess<00:05:46.259> really<00:05:47.259> not<00:05:47.409> much<00:05:47.530> else

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
this video I guess really not much else

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.529
