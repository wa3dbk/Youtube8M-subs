00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.049
 There girls come with you. 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.020
 Good as I promised you in our 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 facebook page facebook.com neighborhood 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.450
 fleck 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 today I'm going to teach you a technique 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 you to transform your 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.630
 dress or long skirt in invested or 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 a skirt a letti that moves my 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.560
 he was long and I was body and he in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 formula 1 in a format to transform 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.469
 though here it's good for you to do is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:42.359
 It is very easy to join the two 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 things on the side you put the seams together 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:50.280
 you'll cut it out in a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 v or u format was in format 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 of u is this format that is a championship 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.780
 and down here I left a little 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.299
 but it 's daylight I gave a light 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 rounded up so you can see how 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.189
 remained open 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.700
 It's so easy so easy that you 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.520
 he cut a v format or or 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 ready you 're wearing your cap and so 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.490
 simple so easy 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.430
 Look just to see how he stayed. 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.579
 underneath and was straight I made a rounded 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.369
 Let's get the tape right with the tape. 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:33.299
 average metric on body to see size 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.630
 What do you want your dress to look like? 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.939
 he counts any one said Sergio or not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.179
 my case I did in prison and silver for 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.969
 that reason emphasis on the market 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.090
 after you cut him informed of 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.420
 rivers and round here in bar 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.720
 dress 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 and he stays a very pretty night very 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 It's pretty even this technique you can 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.740
 wear on invested skirts and also 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.420
 some good sweaters and my dress 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 in a very good way he left it 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.180
 very fabric is as you can see 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.970
 a lot has really been 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.790
 and for you to do this technique save the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.170
 fabric that I have left in the next 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.970
 tutorial I'll show you how 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.489
 reuse in kind 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.530
 Good, I hope you liked it. 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.049
 has a lot of tips and lots of technique to 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.799
 To do this is only you to ask and cut 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.850
 in v-format v is thus 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.310
 the format of u 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.350
 so I hope you have 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.810
