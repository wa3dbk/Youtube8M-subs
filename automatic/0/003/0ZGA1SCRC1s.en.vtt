so might not have quite the sound like
that<00:01:17.370> one<00:01:17.520> had<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.030> volume<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.540> the

that one had a little more volume in the
high<00:01:18.780> end<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.150> tends<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.229> some

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
high end this one tends to have some

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.050 
high end this one tends to have some
versatility<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> top<00:01:23.490> end<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.880> me<00:01:23.940> though

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
versatility on the top end for me though

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.640 
versatility on the top end for me though
there's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:25.050> smoothness<00:01:25.350> if

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
there's a little bit more smoothness if

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:37.790 
there's a little bit more smoothness if
i<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.160> i<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:27.300> get<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:30.229> or<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:36.770> get<00:01:37.770> a

little bit more versatility on the top
of<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.780> where<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.250> head<00:01:41.610> with

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
of it where this one I think head with

volume be up there canardo and on the
toe<00:01:59.340> I<00:02:01.220> feel<00:02:02.220> like<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.670> around<00:02:03.000> back<00:02:03.270> its

toe I feel like that around back its
kind<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.810> electric<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.990> high<00:02:06.990> notes

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
kind of electric like the high notes

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.699 
kind of electric like the high notes
just<00:02:07.670> pulsing<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.910> energy<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
just pulsing at this energy the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.699 
just pulsing at this energy the
mutts<00:02:11.519> top<00:02:12.090> those<00:02:12.390> high<00:02:12.600> notes<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:13.470> sound

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
mutts top those high notes they sound

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.220 
mutts top those high notes they sound
sweet<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.900> they're<00:02:16.049> not

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
sweet in there there but they're not

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.340 
sweet in there there but they're not
like<00:02:16.560> oh<00:02:17.299> I'm<00:02:18.299> gonna<00:02:18.450> electrically<00:02:19.019> charged

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
like oh I'm gonna electrically charged

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.069 
like oh I'm gonna electrically charged
down<00:02:20.010> there<00:02:20.850> will<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.360> talk<00:02:21.630> about<00:02:21.690> some

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
down there will we talk about some

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.289 
down there will we talk about some
separation<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.280> one<00:02:23.489> where<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.090> one

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
separation on this one where this one

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.750 
separation on this one where this one
has<00:02:24.420> such<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> big<00:02:25.019> lush<00:02:25.410> low<00:02:25.769> in<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> much

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
has such a big lush low in like a much

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.080 
has such a big lush low in like a much
larger<00:02:27.120> size<00:02:27.299> guitar<00:02:27.829> and<00:02:28.829> this<00:02:29.130> one<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.459> low

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
larger size guitar and this one the low

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.390 
larger size guitar and this one the low
end<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.390> more<00:02:30.600> focused<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> top

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
end is more focused on this one the top

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.860 
end is more focused on this one the top
end<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.030> were<00:02:33.180> doing<00:02:33.390> some<00:02:33.630> stuff

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
end and then we were doing some stuff

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.650 
end and then we were doing some stuff
earlier<00:02:34.280> where<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.400> notice<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.940> even<00:02:36.150> barely

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
earlier where we notice that even barely

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.390 
earlier where we notice that even barely
touching<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.970 

we<00:02:43.400> just<00:02:43.579> get<00:02:43.730> all<00:02:43.969> the<00:02:44.359> note<00:02:44.540> quality<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.799> we

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
we just get all the note quality that we

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.250 
we just get all the note quality that we
had<00:02:46.189> at<00:02:46.340> those<00:02:46.489> higher<00:02:46.700> volumes<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:48.049> takes

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
had at those higher volumes and it takes

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.220 
had at those higher volumes and it takes
seems<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:48.739> some<00:02:49.450> some<00:02:50.450> real<00:02:50.569> Sparkle<00:02:50.930> on

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
seems to have some some real Sparkle on

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.420 
seems to have some some real Sparkle on
those<00:02:51.409> notes<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:53.950> definitely<00:02:54.950> both<00:02:55.129> each<00:02:55.250> have

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
those notes so definitely both each have

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.080 
those notes so definitely both each have
their<00:02:55.549> strengths<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:57.400> that's<00:02:58.400> why<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:58.670> chose

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
their strengths and that's why you chose

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.000 
their strengths and that's why you chose
that<00:02:59.150> guitar<00:02:59.750> right<00:02:59.989> because<00:03:00.319> that's<00:03:00.560> that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
that guitar right because that's that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.679 
that guitar right because that's that
quality<00:03:01.609> that<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.819> don't<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.329> in<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
quality that you don't have in the

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.569 
quality that you don't have in the
current<00:03:03.019> guitar<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.500> you're<00:03:03.590> playing<00:03:03.829> well

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
current guitar that you're playing well

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.920 
current guitar that you're playing well
it's<00:03:05.090> know<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:06.849> this<00:03:07.849> guitar<00:03:08.299> with<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.719> big

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
it's know that this guitar with that big

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.599 
it's know that this guitar with that big
lush<00:03:09.200> bottom<00:03:09.620> I'm<00:03:09.709> playing<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> larger<00:03:10.310> guitar
