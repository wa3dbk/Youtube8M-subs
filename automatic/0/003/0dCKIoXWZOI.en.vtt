instinctively<00:00:20.039> oh<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.949> obviously

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
instinctively oh now I think obviously

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.830 
instinctively oh now I think obviously
the<00:00:23.160> West<00:00:23.400> compared<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> east<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the West compared to the east is the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.830 
the West compared to the east is the
West<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> little<00:00:25.619> more<00:00:25.680> defensively<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
West is a little more defensively and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.970 
West is a little more defensively and
yes<00:00:27.840> funny<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.410> everybody<00:00:28.740> thinks

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
yes funny because not everybody thinks

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
yes funny because not everybody thinks
of<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.449> everybody

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
of it that way but it is like everybody

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
of it that way but it is like everybody
it's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> little<00:00:31.380> more<00:00:31.560> detailed<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.309> around

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it's a little more detailed like around

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's a little more detailed like around
the<00:00:33.059> lines<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.260> it's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the lines and all that so I think it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.110 
the lines and all that so I think it's
just<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> back<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.520> mind<00:00:35.730> every<00:00:36.090> time

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
just in the back of my mind every time

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.799 
just in the back of my mind every time
like<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> bell<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:38.360> in<00:00:39.360> our<00:00:39.570> end

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
like if there's a bell down in our end

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
like if there's a bell down in our end
like<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> make<00:00:40.800> sure<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> puck<00:00:41.250> goes

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
like I have to make sure the puck goes

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
like I have to make sure the puck goes
out<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.000> maybe<00:00:42.239> they<00:00:42.450> try<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> find<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
out but here maybe they try to find the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.040 
out but here maybe they try to find the
middle<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> venerable<00:00:44.360> we<00:00:45.360> work<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> but

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
middle and venerable we work on that but

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
middle and venerable we work on that but
that<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.010> happened<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that I think that happened more so you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
that I think that happened more so you
have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.410> used<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.100> bit

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
have to get used to that a little bit

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
have to get used to that a little bit
and<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.300> maybe<00:00:51.780> sometimes<00:00:52.260> don't<00:00:52.410> pinch<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and and maybe sometimes don't pinch that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
and and maybe sometimes don't pinch that
hard<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> East<00:00:53.460> too<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> little

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
hard in the East too so it's a little

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.799 
hard in the East too so it's a little
bit<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> change<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.360> play

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bit of a change but you know what I play

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
bit of a change but you know what I play
against<00:00:58.020> these<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> times<00:00:58.890> too<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.160> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
against these a lot of times too so it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
against these a lot of times too so it's
just<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:01:00.079> thing<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> need<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> change

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
