they're<00:00:12.090> working<00:00:12.389> better<00:00:12.570> than<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:13.170> you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
they're working better than how you

expected how within ambev did you build

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980 
expected how within ambev did you build
at<00:00:17.340> what<00:00:17.520> processes<00:00:18.180> did<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.539> use<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.960> make

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
at what processes did you use to make

mid-course<00:00:19.410> Corrections<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.520> adjust

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
mid-course Corrections to adjust

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.000 
mid-course Corrections to adjust
especially<00:00:21.869> given<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.170> had<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.439> very<00:00:22.650> tight

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
especially given you had this very tight

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.400 
especially given you had this very tight
focus<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> overall<00:00:23.960> objectives<00:00:24.960> over<00:00:25.080> any

given<00:00:25.769> year<00:00:26.810> as<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.990> said<00:00:28.170> well<00:00:28.320> first<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.830> I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
given year as I said well first of all I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.150 
given year as I said well first of all I
think<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.310> gives<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.910> problem<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> main

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
think this gives this problem the main

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.780 
think this gives this problem the main
responsibility<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> chief<00:00:32.640> executive

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
officer so he put she basically put the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170 
officer so he put she basically put the
ship<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> course<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.430> here's<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.910> mean

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
ship on a course but now here's I mean

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.850 
ship on a course but now here's I mean
if<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:39.899> ice<00:00:40.050> bag<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> do

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
if there is an ice bag it has to do

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.840 
if there is an ice bag it has to do
something<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:43.070> how<00:00:44.070> fast<00:00:44.520> or

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
something about it and know how fast or

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.630 
something about it and know how fast or
how<00:00:44.930> watch<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> delay<00:00:46.469> he<00:00:46.739> has<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.219> terms<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
how watch the delay he has in terms of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
how watch the delay he has in terms of
steering<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> side<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:50.129> another<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:52.050> works

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
steering to a side or another it works

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880 
steering to a side or another it works
when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.520> works<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.739> first<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
when you it works when you have first of

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.860 
when you it works when you have first of
all<00:00:56.010> fast<00:00:56.579> information<00:00:57.180> about<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> market

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
all fast information about the market

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
all fast information about the market
the<00:00:57.930> company<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.770> outside<00:00:59.070> world<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.820> also

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the company the outside world but also

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
the company the outside world but also
when<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> pretty<00:01:00.840> much<00:01:01.020> close<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
when you pretty much close to the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.750 
when you pretty much close to the
operation<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.449> said<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> mean<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.110> were

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
operation as I said I mean we were

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
operation as I said I mean we were
monthly<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> operators<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
monthly with all the operators in the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000 
monthly with all the operators in the
field<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.290> learn<00:01:10.380> anything<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
field and you don't learn anything a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
field and you don't learn anything a
headquarters<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.700> mean<00:01:11.850> numbers<00:01:12.810> paper<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
headquarters I mean numbers paper as a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
headquarters I mean numbers paper as a
that's<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.430> mean<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that's I mean you really got to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.780 
that's I mean you really got to
go<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.409> what's<00:01:16.619> what's<00:01:17.280> happened

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
go there to see what's what's happened

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.969 
go there to see what's what's happened
so<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.299> works<00:01:18.689> both<00:01:18.869> ways<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.770> then

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
so it works both ways so because then

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
so it works both ways so because then
people<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> chance<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> tell<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
people have the chance to tell you you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.740 
people have the chance to tell you you
look<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.740> course<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.340> said<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.390> okay

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
look this course we said it was all okay

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
look this course we said it was all okay
but<00:01:25.250> something's<00:01:26.250> happened<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.759> we've<00:01:26.880> gotta

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but something's happened it we've gotta

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.380 
but something's happened it we've gotta
add<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.970> you've<00:01:30.119> seen

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
add that or you see because you've seen

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990 
add that or you see because you've seen
several<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> same<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.520> it's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
several things at the same time you it's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.069 
several things at the same time you it's
easier<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> disc<00:01:34.460> discrepancy

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
easier for you to see a disc discrepancy

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.469 
easier for you to see a disc discrepancy
appearing<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.610> again<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
appearing and so on but again it's a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
appearing and so on but again it's a
it's<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.610> it's<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.299> process<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:43.110> being<00:01:43.829> very

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's a it's the process of being very

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's a it's the process of being very
close<00:01:44.759> monitoring<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.320> organized<00:01:46.799> way<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
close monitoring in an organized way and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270 
close monitoring in an organized way and
I<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.240> best<00:01:48.390> organized<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.710> going

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I think the best organized way is going

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
I think the best organized way is going
to<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> few<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> revise<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.200> budget<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to the few to revise the budget and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.209 
to the few to revise the budget and
execution<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> yet<00:01:53.960> monthly<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> also<00:01:55.829> having

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
execution of yet monthly and also having

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.870 
execution of yet monthly and also having
the<00:01:56.340> mind<00:01:56.579> set<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.640> you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
I mean how did you avoid that temptation

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
I mean how did you avoid that temptation
of<00:02:24.840> people<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.290> wanting<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.709> give<00:02:25.859> bad<00:02:26.250> news

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
of people not wanting to give bad news

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.130 
of people not wanting to give bad news
or<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:26.879> wanting<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.239> discuss<00:02:27.510> what's<00:02:27.900> working

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
or not wanting to discuss what's working

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.750 
or not wanting to discuss what's working
not<00:02:28.920> according<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.459> plan

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
not according to plan

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240 
not according to plan
I<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.840> starts<00:02:31.290> with<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:32.099> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
I think it starts with the with the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.860 
I think it starts with the with the
right<00:02:32.459> people<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.689> right

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
right people in the and the right

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.470 
right people in the and the right
incentives<00:02:34.530> don't<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.250> don't<00:02:35.760> expect<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
incentives don't so I I don't expect a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.559 
incentives don't so I I don't expect a

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.189 
much as you can and I think that to have
a<00:03:40.919> process<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.729> death<00:03:41.909> is<00:03:42.659> good<00:03:42.959> because

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
a process to death is good because

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.990 
a process to death is good because
otherwise<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.889> plan<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> fuse<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.609> then<00:03:44.879> you

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
otherwise you plan a fuse and then you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.899 
otherwise you plan a fuse and then you
don't<00:03:45.239> go<00:03:45.359> if<00:03:46.199> you<00:03:46.349> have<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:47.280> go<00:03:47.459> there<00:03:47.699> it's

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
don't go if you have to to go there it's

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.020 
don't go if you have to to go there it's
a<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.479> a<00:03:48.629> routine<00:03:49.079> it's<00:03:49.560> much<00:03:49.799> easier<00:03:50.310> to

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
a it's a routine it's much easier to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.210 
a it's a routine it's much easier to
keep<00:03:51.479> track<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.810> things<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.709> how<00:03:52.859> much<00:03:53.069> of

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
keep track of things and how much of

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.039 
keep track of things and how much of
your<00:03:53.310> time<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.609> in<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.269> typical<00:03:54.690> month<00:03:54.840> would

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
your time and in a typical month would

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.710 
your time and in a typical month would
you<00:03:55.199> spend<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.680> these<00:03:55.859> trips<00:03:56.849> out<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.389> out

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
you spend in these trips out to the out

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.500 
you spend in these trips out to the out
of<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.049> field<00:03:58.370> say<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.579> at<00:03:59.639> least<00:03:59.909> one<00:04:00.239> week

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
of the field say that at least one week

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.439 
of the field say that at least one week
the<00:04:00.840> beginning<00:04:01.260> too
