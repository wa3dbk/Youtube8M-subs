00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 demonstrate how easy it is 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 using the printer for example here 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.790
 a printer simply plus press printer 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.390

 Secure on an external medium from the pc 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.890
 then set up in meck put down a 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 make the pass guide, so to speak 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.700
 follow the data you fully 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.620

 or anything else looks best 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.440
 my ex on the channel many many 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.300
 videos that help you to switch to 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.980

 videos that you switch from the pc to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.600
