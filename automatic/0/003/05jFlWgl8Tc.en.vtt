00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.530
 I'm glad to explain to you today my 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.990
 view game khat system account 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.580
 fact theories of it all right then 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.800
 come on 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.590
 everyone knows that every one because it keeps 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.640
 a percentage a unique khat network 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.230
 right and the few balls in the net for x 1 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.440
 for you to understand better I'll leave 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.140
 in the coke screen is the x network of each because 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.350
 good ball because the ball has a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.079
 Network is a Soccer Eagle x has 2 xa 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 super 3x and another 4 x 1 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.180
 for you to better understand how each 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.180
 Pokémon has its percentage and let's 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 assume that the sea cap has 20% of 100% 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.770
 of saints of kout then if you use 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.020
 because it 's good you'll get a x 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.660
 of this percentage today you will have a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.300
 instead of 20% of 100% 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 if you use great balls of fire 2 x 1 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.280
 that is you will have 40% of always 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.760
 always use the super bowl to hurt 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.810
 you will have 60% and 100% you use the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.909
 time you will get 80% and 100% 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 another example the shine pokémons when 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 rains not only have 0.1 percent of 100% 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.659
 of calde if you use because good or even 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 zero percent and 5 percent or 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.729
 whether to use epi 0.2 percent of 100% 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.220
 the super 0.3 of 100% and the other 0 4% and 100% 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.900
 understand 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.140
 Another thing is that the research has a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 caudwell kath system we all know 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.400
 that mpc réver bought pokémons for 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.110
 fixed price, this system says that if 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.100
 you exceed the price of the pokémon of the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.570
 snpc 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.299
 You have the chance to catch him. 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 increased as after explaining this by 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.979
 example google buzz auro an assault 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.150
 he is three cars on the pc ie he is 3 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.820
 one thousand dollars 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.840
 if you spend $ 3,000 in a few 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.430
 balls on it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320
 after you've passed those three 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 thousand dollars in a few balls you will get 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.070
 the chance of credit and increased or 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.960
 Let's give an example. 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 now let's assume you spend 600 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.450
 because normal balls and does not catch the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.810
 past 60 because balls are three Carlos 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.200
 martins shop for you to buy right 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.640
 or is it the price of bauru so if you 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.739
 spend 61 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.569
 you will have passed the price of it yourself 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.730
 that it is only for five of him then when 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.099
 you pass you will have aa network of 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.560
 increased but this only applies to the 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.959
 khat system when it passes the price 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.790
 him and he realizes the other thing is not 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.160
 all the Pokémon that enters this 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.830
 system has a price limit for this 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 system as an example if a Pokémon 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.790
 it costs 50k 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.620
 mp if it does not enter the system 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.569
 credit on account of injury because it is 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 very expensive and I am an example the guys 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.060
 I do not know if it is I do not know if it is this price 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.069
 fixed good this was the video more for 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.530
 explain - there for those who are beginning to 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.900
 play here still did not send how 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.060
 It works khat system of the game and to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.130
 Who did not even know how to try to help? 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.540
 And the crew is good, I hope I have helped 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.540
 next video spoke the
