character<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> course<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
character and over the course of the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130 
character and over the course of the
story<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.560> grew<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.820> her<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> lot<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.810> as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
story I grew to like her a lot more as

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800 
story I grew to like her a lot more as
she<00:02:04.530> became<00:02:04.920> stronger<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> started<00:02:06.119> standing

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
she became stronger and started standing

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
she became stronger and started standing
up<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.110> herself<00:02:07.259> more<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.610> really

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
up for herself more and I really really

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
up for herself more and I really really
liked<00:02:09.420> her<00:02:09.690> transformation<00:02:10.200> by<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> end<00:02:11.129> of

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
liked her transformation by the end of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.930 
liked her transformation by the end of
the<00:02:11.489> novel

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the novel

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
the novel
I<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.390> wish

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
I do wish

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
I do wish
she<00:02:13.290> would<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.530> taken<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.220> step<00:02:14.550> further

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
she would have taken it a step further

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.540 
she would have taken it a step further
she<00:02:15.599> doesn't<00:02:15.810> really<00:02:16.080> make<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.650> lot<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.040> efforts

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
she doesn't really make a lot of efforts

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.780 
she doesn't really make a lot of efforts
to<00:02:18.000> control<00:02:18.810> her<00:02:19.110> power<00:02:19.319> or<00:02:19.739> learn<00:02:20.190> about<00:02:20.550> her

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
to control her power or learn about her

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
to control her power or learn about her
abilities<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.810> extent<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> her

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
abilities and the extent of her

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.309 
abilities and the extent of her
abilities<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.239> feel<00:02:24.690> like<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
abilities but I feel like that's the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.229 
abilities but I feel like that's the
kind<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.770> stuff<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.280> we're<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
kind of stuff that we're really going to

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.600 
kind of stuff that we're really going to
get<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> lot<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.170> book<00:02:28.470> 2<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.040> later<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
get a lot of in book 2 and later in the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.820 
get a lot of in book 2 and later in the
series<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.569> have<00:02:31.050> high<00:02:31.260> hopes<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.650> that

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
series so I do have high hopes for that

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.699 
series so I do have high hopes for that
another<00:02:32.459> aspect<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.270> really<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:34.050> liked<00:02:34.319> was

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
another aspect I really really liked was

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.270 
another aspect I really really liked was
the<00:02:34.819> romance<00:02:35.819> with<00:02:36.180> Adam<00:02:36.690> Adam<00:02:37.080> was<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:38.069> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the romance with Adam Adam was just a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.729 
the romance with Adam Adam was just a
great<00:02:38.520> character<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.269> romance<00:02:39.810> between<00:02:40.080> him

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
great character the romance between him

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.180 
great character the romance between him
and<00:02:41.010> Juliet<00:02:41.489> was<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:41.940> sweet<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:43.190> passionate

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
and Juliet was so sweet and passionate

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.830 
and Juliet was so sweet and passionate
and<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.489> feel<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.090> writing<00:02:45.360> really

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and I feel like the writing really

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.380 
and I feel like the writing really
enhanced<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.100> romance<00:02:47.730> between<00:02:48.000> them

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
enhanced the romance between them

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.170 
enhanced the romance between them
because<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.290> powerful<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.489> vivid<00:02:50.970> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
because it's so powerful and vivid it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.479 
because it's so powerful and vivid it
really<00:02:51.569> made<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.530> scenes<00:02:52.830> between<00:02:53.100> them

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
really made the scenes between them

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.090 
really made the scenes between them
electric<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.450> lots<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.380> chemistry<00:02:55.980> between

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
electric and lots of chemistry between

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.650

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
far as those three go I feel like Adam

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.150 
far as those three go I feel like Adam
is<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.959> know<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.650> least<00:03:04.920> I

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.300 
in the series so far he's just so
interesting<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.880> complex<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.290> kind<00:03:29.100> of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
excited to see how this dynamic plays

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.270 
excited to see how this dynamic plays
out<00:04:33.599> in<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.960> future<00:04:34.110> books<00:04:34.500> there<00:04:34.740> were<00:04:34.770> a

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
out in the future books there were a

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.460 
out in the future books there were a
couple<00:04:35.610> aspects<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.659> this<00:04:36.810> book<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
couple aspects of this book that I

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.920 
couple aspects of this book that I
thought<00:04:37.800> were<00:04:38.130> lacking<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.970> little<00:04:39.120> bit<00:04:39.240> namely

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
thought were lacking a little bit namely

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.529 
thought were lacking a little bit namely
that<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.740> pacing<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.700> first<00:04:41.909> half<00:04:42.210> was<00:04:42.510> a

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
that the pacing of the first half was a

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.330 
that the pacing of the first half was a
little<00:04:42.990> bit<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.349> slow<00:04:43.500> side<00:04:43.860> things

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
little bit on the slow side things

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.909 
little bit on the slow side things
really<00:04:44.729> get<00:04:45.030> interesting<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:46.020> awesome<00:04:46.650> about

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
really get interesting and awesome about

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.040 
really get interesting and awesome about
halfway<00:04:47.250> through<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.820> book<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.930> other

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
halfway through the book and the other

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.260 
halfway through the book and the other
thing<00:04:49.409> was<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:50.070> world-building<00:04:50.490> was

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
thing was that the world-building was

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.290 
thing was that the world-building was
kind<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.169> vague<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:53.010> sketchy<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:53.849> wish<00:04:54.090> it

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
kind of vague and sketchy and I wish it

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.640 
kind of vague and sketchy and I wish it
would<00:04:54.450> have<00:04:54.539> been<00:04:54.750> developed<00:04:55.289> more

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
would have been developed more

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.680 
would have been developed more
especially<00:04:56.130> from<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.789> ending<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.270> this<00:04:57.450> book

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
especially from the ending of this book

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.210 
especially from the ending of this book
it<00:04:57.840> seems<00:04:58.050> like<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.470> dystopian

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
it seems like the dystopian

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.880 
it seems like the dystopian
reestablishment<00:05:00.000> plot<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.690> going<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.169> be<00:05:01.320> kind

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
reestablishment plot is going to be kind

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.430 
reestablishment plot is going to be kind
of<00:05:02.039> a<00:05:02.220> big<00:05:02.490> deal<00:05:02.729> for<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:03.330> overall<00:05:03.750> arc<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.229> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
of a big deal for the overall arc of the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.290 
of a big deal for the overall arc of the
series<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.130> felt<00:05:05.370> like<00:05:05.520> we<00:05:05.760> just<00:05:05.789> didn't

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
series and I felt like we just didn't

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.050 
series and I felt like we just didn't
get<00:05:06.419> enough<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.530> plot<00:05:08.010> established<00:05:08.849> in

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
get enough of that plot established in

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.330 
get enough of that plot established in
the<00:05:09.240> first<00:05:09.479> book<00:05:09.840> overall<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.650> loved<00:05:11.070> the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
the first book overall I loved the

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.100 
the first book overall I loved the
characters<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.210> really<00:05:12.690> loved<00:05:12.960> the

characters and I really loved the

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.290 
characters and I really loved the
writing<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.740> even<00:05:14.400> though<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.580> thought<00:05:15.030> the

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
writing and even though I thought the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.000 
writing and even though I thought the
world-building<00:05:15.630> confused<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.590> little<00:05:16.830> more

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
world-building confused a little more

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.790 
world-building confused a little more
development<00:05:17.610> I'm<00:05:17.820> still<00:05:18.270> really<00:05:19.140> into<00:05:19.440> the
