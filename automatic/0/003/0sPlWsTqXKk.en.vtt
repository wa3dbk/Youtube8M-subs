00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.459
 here's the idea of this i'm flying to china is cool 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.869
 but in general this is a great opportunity 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.910
 perform show yourself to any country 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.400
 to speak for Belarus that is how would it 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.740
 very important and we will try to play 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.920
 worthy and I was ashamed to come back 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 backwards 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.910
 first of all this is a tournament a chance to see 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.789
 a bunch of different teams from other countries 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.010
 play live with them directly 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:45.370
 panic command this is a mix based 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.260
 teams mayn't and players taken from 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.179
 randomness just before the third season 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.980
 the corner of the book so the guys get 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.140
 precious experience i talked to 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.109
 captains of other teams suggested how 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.289
 were very valuable frames so that they too 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.229
 got the experience recruited from the gel game not 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.330
 can format 7-42 and so we have 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.030
 such a strong composition 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 Overall, when we reached the final of some 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.500
 there were no special emotions because we 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.540
 Were ready initially because we 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.770
 We get to the finals and that is, the teams were 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.690
 not quite strong and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.820
 our main rival viruses were 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.890
 other opposite grids and that is 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.840
 we kind of took it for granted and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.590
 immediately prepare that our channel we 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.990
 should get one hundred percent overall 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.560
 there was no one to lose so the final 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.500
 took you when we thought that the final 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.050
 will be easy enough for us we already 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.080
 To defeat the virus, it was 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.690
 the finale of the Belarusian and just to the same 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.210
 we could beat our urine dignitas this 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.620
 He betrayed us some strength is that it is well 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.750
 there we were generally sure for a hundred 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.750
 percent that favorite important win 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.540
 the match started successfully we appeared these 10 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.520
 then there was an incomprehensible draw at ruinberg 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.770
 further went on a series of incredible 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.319
 unpleasant events on ensk lolchto 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.140
 do something better just lend 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.970
 me at the monastery crayfish trainer 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.610
 somehow managed to get stuck already twice 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.709
 how can I do that? 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.019
 present on himmedsdorf 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.930
 Angel did not read the situation did not have time 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.239
 time to leave him too 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.640
 but didn't take it all went wrong since we 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.349
 planned and second third fourth 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.349
 we just gave the game 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.420
 emotions were shocked of course we 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.670
 overwhelmed we needed some 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.109
 emotional discharge in general and not already 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.239
 started out as a joke Vat even one 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.920
 friend supposedly if they were able to three rounds 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.989
 take us then why can't we three 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.719
 times in a row to take and somehow able 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.329
 get together mindset bring the matter to 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.599
 the end of all rand played with a score of 3 3 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.849
 and on the extra rounds played 43 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.629
 just hopped around the scene like crazy 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.150
 I just clenched my fists in my arms shouting yes 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.889
 very long and very loud right all 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.650
 the audience watched us at that moment 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.989
 emotions were going through the roof just we became 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.669
 the circle began to jump for joy even 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.840
 soak showed that they soon hours 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:16.919
 will go down to the viewers and in general this 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:24.900
 It was very cool happy for a very long time 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:26.879
 almost almost then answer often our case 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.889
 band on lan-finals and so it is very 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.040
 strange story how could such a thing 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:35.970
 happen there is just incomprehensible but it 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.819
 in general, hammer in those just don't know that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.979
 it would be impossible but it happened 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.949
 that all cis countries in one group will 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.479
 haul on we only come for 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.810
 victory we go nothing more 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.810
 remains
