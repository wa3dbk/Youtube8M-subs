 really frightened from us very 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.550
 early or in the evening when it got dark 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.100
 you could see them come out all three of 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.680
 black rebozos covering the ugly 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.439
 never plagued wrinkle face 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.230

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.840
 strict business issues 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.030

 that the red app was much more 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.840
 when they opened their mouths as if they had 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 a dead cat in the belly right there 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.110
 I could see what was left of the teeth 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.960
 like flies standing on the black gums 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.360
 they did not take too soon they would come back 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.840
 with the errand looking distrustful to 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.570

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.710
 smiling with the magic bottles that 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.620
 would cure them the red ones soon 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.460

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.800
 they sounded miraculously of diseases 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.620
 of death 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.700
 an old man regained his sight an invalid 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.860
 he got up from his bed to the last 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.930
 they told of a resurrected man who 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.040
 I was two days dead and that 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.700
 rose to follow 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.129
 drinking to die for later I had the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.310
 opportunity to see them work my aunt 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.430
 he requested his services to say of my aunt 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.159
 bad luck harassed her without rest 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.040
 and a little pain that brought embedded in a 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.500
 cost on the other hand the cats are 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 swirled in his house and the dogs 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.379
 they barked as the witches passed by 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.870
 his work with my aunt dancing to his 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.200
 around it they soaked it with mezcal 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.269
 they snorted loudly 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.060
 happened to give him a good spanking with 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.459
 a bundle of weeds while they started 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.250
 to mutter things that I did not understand and to 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.349
 turn your eyes so much that I 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.500
 it was very scary 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.260
 my aunt shuddered became stiff and 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.019
 threw his head back starting to 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.750
 Bid as if you made a great effort 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.599
 the witches became threatening 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.540
 they shouted as if they were fighting with someone 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.819
 until my aunt calmed down and stayed with the 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.000
 mouth wide open where it started to 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.430
 get out a black one like when 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.130
 the grandfather founds pure then they left 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.040
 toads by dozens and black snakes 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.980
 who were just jumping were caught by 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.760
 some of the witches in jars of 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.640
 glass was in fifth grade I knew 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.860
 letters and numbers at school nobody 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.980
 won with the square root and the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.770
 natural sciences why I keep thinking 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.310
