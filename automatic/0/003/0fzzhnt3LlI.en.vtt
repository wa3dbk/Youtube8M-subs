there's<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> SLT<00:00:52.440> architecture<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.879> mirror

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
there's the SLT architecture the mirror

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
there's the SLT architecture the mirror
here<00:00:54.390> doesn't<00:00:54.750> flip<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
here doesn't flip up and down so you can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
here doesn't flip up and down so you can
shoot<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.309> 8<00:00:56.430> frames<00:00:56.640> per<00:00:56.940> second<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.449> you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
shoot at 8 frames per second and you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
shoot at 8 frames per second and you
have<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> world's<00:00:58.859> best<00:00:59.070> focusing<00:00:59.940> during

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
have the world's best focusing during

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.500 
have the world's best focusing during
video<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:01.710> doesn't<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> hunt<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.359> there's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
video it doesn't have to hunt so there's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.640 
video it doesn't have to hunt so there's
a<00:01:03.539> lot<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> good<00:01:03.930> things<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.439> this
