00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
though you got stuck to figure out what

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.740 
though you got stuck to figure out what
I<00:01:01.030> got<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.930> thing<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.680> got<00:01:05.890> was

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
obviously since I have the 80 Pro now I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.870 
obviously since I have the 80 Pro now I
didn't<00:01:09.700> get<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.060> coil<00:01:10.570> cover<00:01:10.690> until<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.560> now

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
didn't get the coil cover until just now

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.510 
didn't get the coil cover until just now
and<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.030> don't<00:01:13.210> like<00:01:13.480> using<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:15.280> mantle

attackers<00:01:15.880> without<00:01:16.150> them<00:01:16.360> it's<00:01:17.290> not<00:01:17.410> fine

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
attackers without them it's not fine

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.410 
attackers without them it's not fine
that<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:17.890> ended<00:01:18.160> up<00:01:18.190> damaging<00:01:18.400> them<00:01:19.030> within<00:01:19.240> a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
that I ended up damaging them within a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.470 
that I ended up damaging them within a
year<00:01:19.660> so<00:01:20.290> I<00:01:20.350> decided<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:21.150> invest<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.270> little<00:01:22.360> bit

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
year so I decided to invest a little bit

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.920 
year so I decided to invest a little bit
of<00:01:22.600> money<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:24.300> survival<00:01:25.300> I<00:01:25.570> guess<00:01:25.720> what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
of money in the survival I guess what

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.630 
of money in the survival I guess what
you<00:01:26.020> would<00:01:26.110> call<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:26.950> eighty<00:01:27.220> part

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
you would call it of the eighty part

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
you would call it of the eighty part
when<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:27.820> am<00:01:27.970> invested<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.720> coil<00:01:28.900> cover

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
when I am invested in a coil cover

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.860 
when I am invested in a coil cover

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
interesting image just have to look at

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.290 
interesting image just have to look at
it<00:03:48.760> more<00:03:48.820> closely<00:03:48.970> later<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.970> can<00:03:55.090> see

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
it more closely later you can see

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.500 
it more closely later you can see
finally<00:03:55.630> there's<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.740> classifier<00:03:57.340> which<00:03:58.330> is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
finally there's the classifier which is

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.440 
finally there's the classifier which is
a<00:03:59.130> basically<00:04:00.130> they're<00:04:00.370> all<00:04:00.459> 5<00:04:00.670> gallon<00:04:01.090> bucket

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
a basically they're all 5 gallon bucket

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.220 
a basically they're all 5 gallon bucket
it's<00:04:02.110> supposed<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.530> fit<00:04:02.910> perfectly<00:04:03.910> um<00:04:04.180> on<00:04:04.810> the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
it's supposed to fit perfectly um on the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.660 
it's supposed to fit perfectly um on the
five<00:04:05.410> gallon<00:04:05.590> bucket<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.100> just<00:04:06.250> shake<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.459> to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
five gallon bucket you just shake it to

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.120 
five gallon bucket you just shake it to
get<00:04:06.820> number<00:04:07.410> smaller<00:04:08.410> pieces<00:04:08.740> into<00:04:09.100> the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
get number smaller pieces into the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.730 
get number smaller pieces into the
bucket<00:04:09.520> it's<00:04:10.420> something<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.870> I'm<00:04:11.020> always<00:04:11.410> I

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
bucket it's something that I'm always I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.110 
bucket it's something that I'm always I
saw<00:04:12.040> they<00:04:12.310> don't<00:04:12.490> know<00:04:12.550> though<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:12.910> these

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
saw they don't know though is that these

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.850 
saw they don't know though is that these
teeth<00:04:13.390> fit<00:04:13.600> perfectly<00:04:14.020> on<00:04:14.320> each<00:04:14.620> other<00:04:14.800> like

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
teeth fit perfectly on each other like

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.800 
teeth fit perfectly on each other like
this<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:15.880> if<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.030> don't<00:04:16.209> have<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.390> bucket<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
this so if you don't have a bucket you

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.050 
this so if you don't have a bucket you
can<00:04:16.840> use<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.200> ten<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> half<00:04:17.650> inch<00:04:17.890> one<00:04:18.130> just

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
can use the ten and a half inch one just

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.200 
can use the ten and a half inch one just
to<00:04:19.180> shake<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.600> like<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.930> into<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.200> bucket<00:04:21.210> my

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
to shake it like that into the bucket my

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.820 
to shake it like that into the bucket my
little<00:04:22.450> buddy<00:04:22.570> that's<00:04:22.690> pretty<00:04:22.960> much<00:04:23.080> all<00:04:23.410> this

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
little buddy that's pretty much all this

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.510 
little buddy that's pretty much all this
