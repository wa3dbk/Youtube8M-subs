 observe is one to the cliff 4007 ah 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.430
 then we enter the battery 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.810
 now we press the upload button 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.400
 and the power button 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.649

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.009
 more for about 8 seconds 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.920

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.920
 the recovery menu appears 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.770
 now here we go down with less volume 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.890
 up to where it says u and datafactory reset and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.870
