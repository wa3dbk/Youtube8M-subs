00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is something that I'm actually really

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.699 
is something that I'm actually really
interested<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.959> guys<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
interested in because as you guys know I

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.469 
interested in because as you guys know I
don't<00:01:22.770> tend<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> post<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.819> lot<00:01:23.940> of<00:01:24.090> vehicle

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
don't tend to post a lot of vehicle

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.790 
don't tend to post a lot of vehicle
gameplay<00:01:24.660> on<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.170> channel<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.619> that's

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
gameplay on my channel and that's

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.919 
gameplay on my channel and that's
because<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.399> don't<00:01:26.940> tend<00:01:27.209> to<00:01:27.300> use<00:01:27.569> vehicles

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
because I don't tend to use vehicles

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.559 
because I don't tend to use vehicles
especially<00:01:28.259> air<00:01:29.130> vehicles<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.149> I'm<00:01:30.300> not

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
especially air vehicles because I'm not

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.510 
especially air vehicles because I'm not
very<00:01:30.750> good<00:01:30.899> in<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.349> so<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> test<00:01:32.099> range<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
very good in them so the test range is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010 
very good in them so the test range is
something<00:01:32.819> that<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.970> could<00:01:33.149> really<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.720> being

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
something that I could really see being

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.529 
something that I could really see being
utilized<00:01:34.619> by<00:01:34.770> myself<00:01:35.220> quite<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.550> lot<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.509> lot

in mind another question that was asked
to<00:02:04.649> Lars<00:02:04.830> Gustafson<00:02:05.520> by<00:02:05.670> IGN<00:02:06.239> was<00:02:06.780> why<00:02:06.989> we<00:02:07.229> are

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to Lars Gustafson by IGN was why we are

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.350 
to Lars Gustafson by IGN was why we are
still<00:02:07.649> using<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.280> venom<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:09.000> had<00:02:09.179> from

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
still using the venom that we had from

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
still using the venom that we had from
battlefield<00:02:09.899> 3<00:02:10.140> why<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.500> change<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.890> out<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
battlefield 3 why not change it out to a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.949 
battlefield 3 why not change it out to a
black<00:02:11.520> hawk<00:02:11.790> or<00:02:11.970> something<00:02:12.450> different<00:02:12.870> for

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
black hawk or something different for

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.110 
black hawk or something different for
the<00:02:13.050> u.s.<00:02:13.380> faction<00:02:13.890> why<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.970> have

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the u.s. faction why do we have to have

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.030 
the u.s. faction why do we have to have
the<00:02:15.270> venom<00:02:15.540> again<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.409> he<00:02:16.530> answered<00:02:16.680> that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the venom again and he answered that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.770 
the venom again and he answered that
simply<00:02:17.489> because<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.299> most<00:02:18.510> up-to-date

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
simply because it's the most up-to-date

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
simply because it's the most up-to-date
vehicle<00:02:19.590> that's<00:02:19.739> used<00:02:20.010> by<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.250> US<00:02:20.519> Marines

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
vehicle that's used by the US Marines

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.010 
vehicle that's used by the US Marines
and<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.719> can

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
and I can

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.450 
and I can
completely<00:02:22.350> understand<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.070> they<00:02:23.190> want<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
completely understand that they want to

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.920 
completely understand that they want to
try<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.760> make<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> game<00:02:24.210> as<00:02:24.360> realistic<00:02:24.660> as

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
try and make the game as realistic as

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
try and make the game as realistic as
possible<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.650> actually<00:02:26.010> set<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> future

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
possible it's actually set in the future

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.550 
possible it's actually set in the future
which<00:02:27.090> means<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> most<00:02:28.260> up-to-date

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
which means this is the most up-to-date

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.070 
which means this is the most up-to-date
Intel<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.880> US<00:02:30.180> Marine<00:02:30.540> faction

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
Intel we have for the US Marine faction

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.840 
Intel we have for the US Marine faction
but<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.680> doesn't<00:02:31.770> necessarily<00:02:32.070> mean<00:02:32.550> that's

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
but that doesn't necessarily mean that's

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.890 
but that doesn't necessarily mean that's
going<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> change<00:02:33.210> for<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> other<00:02:33.660> two

going to change for the other two

battlefield 4 that went up and it showed

battlefield 4 that went up and it showed

map<00:02:56.670> what's<00:02:57.570> quite<00:02:57.810> interesting<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.590> that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
map what's quite interesting is that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.710 
map what's quite interesting is that
most<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> action<00:02:59.550> seems<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.180> be<00:03:00.300> at<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
most of the action seems to be at the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360 
most of the action seems to be at the
base<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.380> dam<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.800> there's<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.250> nice

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
base of the dam and there's a nice

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.980 
base of the dam and there's a nice
island<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.060> middle<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> lake<00:03:03.660> at<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
island in the middle of the lake at the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.570 
island in the middle of the lake at the
bottom<00:03:04.350> there<00:03:04.500> which<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.770> kind<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.100> cool<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.520> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
bottom there which is kind of cool and I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.130 
bottom there which is kind of cool and I
expect<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.150> that's<00:03:06.300> going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.720> affected

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
expect that that's going to be affected

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.020 
expect that that's going to be affected
by<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.350> LEvolution<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.250> because<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:08.820> pretty

by the LEvolution here because we pretty

but considering it's in the same list as
an<00:03:28.860> m1<00:03:29.220> Abrams<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.910> pretty<00:03:30.420> much<00:03:30.510> certain

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
an m1 Abrams and pretty much certain

an m1 Abrams and pretty much certain
that<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.260> thing<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.680> going<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.860> be<00:03:32.010> plopped

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
that this thing is going to be plopped

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.370 
that this thing is going to be plopped
onto<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.790> battlefield<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.780> us<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.140> be<00:03:34.260> able

to<00:03:34.680> man<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.700> potentially<00:03:36.420> means<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.840> could

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
to man that potentially means we could

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.750 
to man that potentially means we could
be<00:03:37.170> driving<00:03:37.350> around<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.920> submarine<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.610> this

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
be driving around a submarine on this

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.540

map in the water area below but for now

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.160 
map in the water area below but for now
however<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.000> take<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.420> with<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> pinch<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.959> salt

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
however I take it with a pinch of salt

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.360 
however I take it with a pinch of salt
because<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.650> course<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.160> all

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
because of course that is all

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.120 
because of course that is all
speculation<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.709> were<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
speculation and that if that were to

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.620 
speculation and that if that were to
happen<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.520> would<00:03:47.760> be<00:03:47.940> an<00:03:48.120> absolutely

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
happen that would be an absolutely

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.020 
happen that would be an absolutely
awesome<00:03:48.900> feature<00:03:49.530> couple<00:03:50.520> more<00:03:50.640> things<00:03:50.670> I
