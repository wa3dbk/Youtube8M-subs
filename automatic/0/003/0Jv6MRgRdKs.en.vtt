want so let's say for example you want s
health<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.990> could<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:17.130> could<00:01:17.159> have

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
health you could do that you could have

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
health you could do that you could have
it<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.810> another<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it right there it's just another way of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.350 
it right there it's just another way of
multitasking<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> phone<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.090> instead

on the other side so left or right
whichever<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.689> cool

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
whichever one you want now it's cool

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.090 
whichever one you want now it's cool
that<00:01:46.140> has<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.470> these<00:01:46.590> features<00:01:46.799> they've

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that has all these features they've

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.969 
that has all these features they've
enhanced<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.049> still<00:01:49.439> I'd

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
enhanced it a little bit but still I'd

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.469 
enhanced it a little bit but still I'd
say<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.340> still<00:01:50.460> missing<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.149> bit<00:01:51.329> more

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
say it's still missing a little bit more

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
say it's still missing a little bit more
substance<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.439> definitely<00:01:52.590> add<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
substance they could definitely add a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340 
substance they could definitely add a
few<00:01:53.280> more<00:01:53.310> useful<00:01:53.759> features<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.049> suppose

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
few more useful features but we suppose

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.899 
few more useful features but we suppose
that<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:56.040> seeing<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that you know seeing that this just a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.020 
that you know seeing that this just a
larger<00:01:57.240> sized<00:01:57.450> version<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> s6<00:01:58.590> edge<00:01:59.030> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
larger sized version of the s6 edge the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.490 
larger sized version of the s6 edge the
added<00:02:00.450> features<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:00.899> nice

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
added features are nice

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.020
