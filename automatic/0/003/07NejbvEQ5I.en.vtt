the styling cues on cars would be when

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.709 
the styling cues on cars would be when
it<00:00:07.859> comes<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.189> movies<00:00:08.580> though<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.120> mean<00:00:09.330> let's

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
it comes to movies though I mean let's

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.879 
it comes to movies though I mean let's
be<00:00:09.840> honest<00:00:10.230> they<00:00:10.380> never<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.769> been

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
be honest they never have been

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.709 
be honest they never have been
considered<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.400> be<00:00:11.550> works<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.969> art<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.420> mean

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
considered to be works of art I mean

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.910 
considered to be works of art I mean
there's<00:00:12.870> only<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.170> many<00:00:13.230> ways<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.740> could

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
there's only so many ways you could

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.660 
there's only so many ways you could
restyle<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.549> box<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.049> say<00:00:16.440> Citroen<00:00:17.220> which

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
restyle a box not so say Citroen which

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.189 
restyle a box not so say Citroen which
is<00:00:17.820> why<00:00:17.910> they've<00:00:18.150> always<00:00:18.330> put<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> Picasso

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
is why they've always put the Picasso

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.189 
is why they've always put the Picasso
signature<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.250> their<00:00:20.430> MPVs<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.869> thought<00:00:22.050> we

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
signature to their MPVs so we thought we

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
signature to their MPVs so we thought we
put<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> test<00:00:22.650> we've<00:00:23.130> come<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> Janice

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
put it to the test we've come to Janice

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.210 
put it to the test we've come to Janice
Berg<00:00:23.939> art<00:00:24.150> gallery<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:25.140> understand<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
Berg art gallery to understand the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.279 
Berg art gallery to understand the
characteristics<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.060> make<00:00:27.240> Picasso<00:00:27.840> such<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
characteristics that make Picasso such a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.429 
characteristics that make Picasso such a
nonconformist<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.340> popular<00:00:30.119> artist<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> see

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
nonconformist and popular artist and see

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.459 
nonconformist and popular artist and see
if<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> new<00:00:31.800> Picasso<00:00:32.669> c4<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.200> any

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
if the new Picasso c4 actually has any

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.240 
if the new Picasso c4 actually has any
of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> shared<00:00:34.980> characteristics<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.100> think

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
of the shared characteristics so I think

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.470 
of the shared characteristics so I think
it's<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.489> obvious<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> I'm<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> peasant

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's pretty obvious that I'm a peasant

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's pretty obvious that I'm a peasant
when<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.930> comes<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> art<00:00:40.469> appreciation<00:00:41.010> terms

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
when it comes to art appreciation terms

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.670 
when it comes to art appreciation terms
which<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.030> why<00:00:42.149> I've<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.360> mushi<00:00:42.750> oh<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.170> the

this what's making him so cool well a
lot<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> people<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.390> understand<00:00:54.870> because

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
lot of people don't understand because

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
lot of people don't understand because
so<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.620> his<00:00:55.739> work<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.250> diverse<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so because his work is so diverse and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
so because his work is so diverse and
it's<00:00:57.420> also<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:58.350> difficult<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.920> people<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's also very difficult for people to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.799 
it's also very difficult for people to
interact<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
interact with that because it's not a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
interact with that because it's not a
pretty<00:01:01.079> picture<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.190> he<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> front-runner

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
pretty picture but he was a front-runner

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
pretty picture but he was a front-runner
and<00:01:03.390> an<00:01:03.539> innovator<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.739> call<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and an innovator in what we call the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
and an innovator in what we call the
Belle<00:01:05.280> Epoque<00:01:05.670> period<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> art<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:07.020> was

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
Belle Epoque period of art which was

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
Belle Epoque period of art which was
really<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> free<00:01:07.950> spirit<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.000> early<00:01:09.360> 20th

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
really the free spirit of the early 20th

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
really the free spirit of the early 20th
century<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.470> people<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.100> exploring

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
century and people are really exploring

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
century and people are really exploring
and<00:01:11.790> having<00:01:11.820> fun<00:01:12.210> most<00:01:12.600> obviously<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.110> look

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and having fun most obviously you look

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200 
and having fun most obviously you look
at<00:01:13.290> Picasso's<00:01:13.860> work<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.549> diverse<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
at Picasso's work it's so diverse so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.480 
at Picasso's work it's so diverse so
different<00:01:15.600> different<00:01:15.869> materials<00:01:16.320> different

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
different different materials different

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.890 
different different materials different
styles<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.640> guess<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.479> sets<00:01:18.750> him

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
styles I guess that is what sets him

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.890 
styles I guess that is what sets him
apart<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.250> certain

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
apart but are there certain

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.330 
apart but are there certain
characteristics<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.290> kind<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> found

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
characteristics that are kind of found

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.800 
characteristics that are kind of found
in<00:01:23.460> every<00:01:23.670> single<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> Picasso's<00:01:24.630> works

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
in every single one of Picasso's works

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
in every single one of Picasso's works
beside<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> signature<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.580> went<00:01:26.759> through<00:01:26.880> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
beside the signature he went through so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
beside the signature he went through so
many<00:01:27.119> different<00:01:27.420> periods<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> his<00:01:28.080> life<00:01:28.290> where

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
many different periods of his life where

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
many different periods of his life where
he<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.040> influenced<00:01:29.549> by<00:01:29.579> line<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.240> form<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
he was influenced by line and form and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
he was influenced by line and form and
you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.070> these

c4 Picasso does it break the mold I

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.920 
c4 Picasso does it break the mold I
think<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.100> think<00:02:19.250> it's<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:20.150> fun<00:02:20.420> it's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
think so I think it's it's fun it's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.930 
think so I think it's it's fun it's
quirky<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.380> it's<00:02:21.530> very<00:02:21.680> stylish<00:02:21.980> are<00:02:22.820> they

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
quirky and it's very stylish are they

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.840 
quirky and it's very stylish are they
some<00:02:23.150> Picasso<00:02:23.830> clean<00:02:24.830> lines<00:02:25.100> as<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.670> see

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
some Picasso clean lines as you can see

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.540 
some Picasso clean lines as you can see
definitely<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.840> think<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.410> models<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> clean

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
definitely I think it models the clean

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.340 
definitely I think it models the clean
lines<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.150> saw<00:02:29.360> because<00:02:29.750> those<00:02:30.020> artworks

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
lines that we saw because those artworks

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.320 
lines that we saw because those artworks
and<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> said<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.640> quirkiness<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
and like I said the quirkiness and the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.480 
and like I said the quirkiness and the
fenders<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.780> comes<00:02:33.350> out<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.650> Picasso's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
fenders that comes out in Picasso's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.280 
fenders that comes out in Picasso's
later<00:02:34.700> works<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.180> definitely<00:02:35.780> embodied<00:02:36.200> in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
later works is definitely embodied in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.870 
later works is definitely embodied in
