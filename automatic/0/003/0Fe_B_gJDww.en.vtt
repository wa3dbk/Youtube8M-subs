we're gonna play it in the key of D
which<00:00:43.129> for<00:00:43.969> me<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.089> a<00:00:44.210> good<00:00:44.359> sing-along<00:00:44.809> key<00:00:45.019> if

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
which for me is a good sing-along key if

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.020 
which for me is a good sing-along key if
you<00:00:45.379> want<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.589> do<00:00:45.649> it<00:00:45.739> in<00:00:45.829> a<00:00:45.859> different<00:00:45.949> key<00:00:46.280> key

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
you want to do it in a different key key

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.029 
you want to do it in a different key key
put<00:00:47.239> up<00:00:47.329> someplace<00:00:47.629> or<00:00:48.140> transpose<00:00:48.589> it<00:00:48.769> if<00:00:48.949> you

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
put up someplace or transpose it if you

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.079 
put up someplace or transpose it if you
don't<00:00:49.190> know<00:00:49.250> how<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.399> do<00:00:49.519> that<00:00:49.640> check<00:00:49.879> out<00:00:49.969> some

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
don't know how to do that check out some

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.660

fingering I like for a7 is second and

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:21.520 
fingering I like for a7 is second and
third<00:01:20.390> fingers<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.869> know<00:01:20.899> sometimes<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.409> might

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
third fingers I know sometimes you might

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.639 
third fingers I know sometimes you might
think<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:22.009> it's<00:01:22.970> easier<00:01:23.390> especially<00:01:24.200> coming

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
think that it's easier especially coming

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.800 
think that it's easier especially coming
from<00:01:24.770> D<00:01:25.069> you're<00:01:25.940> playing<00:01:26.149> these<00:01:26.330> two<00:01:26.569> fingers

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
from D you're playing these two fingers

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.380 
from D you're playing these two fingers
already<00:01:27.250> what<00:01:28.250> two<00:01:28.429> strings<00:01:28.700> apart<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.240> us

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
already what two strings apart with us

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.789 
already what two strings apart with us
open<00:01:29.720> strength<00:01:29.929> not<00:01:30.110> an<00:01:30.200> open<00:01:30.409> string<00:01:30.530> but<00:01:30.709> no

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
open strength not an open string but no

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.529 
open strength not an open string but no
string<00:01:31.069> in<00:01:31.190> between<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.880> they<00:01:32.360> could<00:01:32.509> just

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
string in between and they could just

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.070 
string in between and they could just
move<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.200> string<00:01:33.560> down<00:01:34.569> it's<00:01:35.569> down<00:01:35.780> on<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
move one string down it's down on the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.930 
move one string down it's down on the
guitar<00:01:36.319> don't<00:01:36.530> forget<00:01:36.799> they<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.670> move<00:01:37.759> one

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
guitar don't forget they can move one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.550 
guitar don't forget they can move one
string<00:01:38.209> down<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.420> land<00:01:38.899> there<00:01:39.079> it's<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.409> a

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
string down to land there it's just a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.859 
string down to land there it's just a
bad<00:01:39.740> habit<00:01:40.219> to<00:01:40.399> get<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:40.969> because<00:01:41.149> there<00:01:41.780> are

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
bad habit to get in because there are

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.179 
bad habit to get in because there are
too<00:01:42.020> many<00:01:42.109> times<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.619> really<00:01:42.770> need<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.100> use

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
too many times you really need to use

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.499 
too many times you really need to use
your<00:01:43.340> second<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.789> third<00:01:43.909> fingers<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.390> gives

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
your second and third fingers it gives
