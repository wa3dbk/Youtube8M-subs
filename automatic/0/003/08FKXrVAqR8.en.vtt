00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
subject areas are divided between theory

subject areas are divided between theory
based<00:00:05.730> subjects<00:00:06.359> so<00:00:06.899> you've<00:00:07.140> got<00:00:07.379> structures

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
based subjects so you've got structures

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.820 
based subjects so you've got structures
history<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.030> architecture<00:00:09.830> environmental

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
science technology and then the other

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.580 
science technology and then the other
half<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> course<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.299> project<00:00:16.049> based<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
half of the course is project based and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.620 
half of the course is project based and
that's<00:00:17.010> situated<00:00:17.670> within<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> studio's<00:00:18.390> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
that's situated within the studio's of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.740 
that's situated within the studio's of
the<00:00:19.020> school<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> student<00:00:20.939> comes<00:00:21.210> into

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the school so when a student comes into

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.630 
the school so when a student comes into
the<00:00:21.900> School<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.199> Architecture<00:00:22.350> they<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the School of Architecture they have a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.050 
the School of Architecture they have a
place<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.420> studio<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.609> would<00:00:26.609> say<00:00:26.699> students

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
place in a studio I would say students

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
place in a studio I would say students
of<00:00:27.119> architecture<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> creative

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of architecture need to be creative

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.749 
of architecture need to be creative
more<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.880> than<00:00:30.029> specifically<00:00:30.660> artistic<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
more so than specifically artistic and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.729 
more so than specifically artistic and
by<00:00:32.759> creative<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> mean<00:00:33.540> they<00:00:33.660> need<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.020> open

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
by creative I mean they need to be open

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.760 
by creative I mean they need to be open
to<00:00:34.770> learning<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.969> taking<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.200> lots<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
to learning and taking on lots of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.460 
to learning and taking on lots of
different<00:00:37.950> media<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.910> ways<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.390> working

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.470 

the<00:00:42.920> artistic<00:00:43.160> flair<00:00:43.490> is<00:00:43.580> an<00:00:43.670> advantage<00:00:44.180> but<00:00:44.360> I

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
the artistic flair is an advantage but I

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.540 
the artistic flair is an advantage but I
don't<00:00:44.690> know<00:00:44.750> if<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.140> requirement<00:00:45.830> some

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
don't know if it's a requirement some

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.570 
don't know if it's a requirement some
ability<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.780> think<00:00:47.990> conceptually<00:00:48.800> I<00:00:49.010> think<00:00:49.370> is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
ability to think conceptually I think is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.820 
ability to think conceptually I think is
a<00:00:49.610> requirement<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:50.750> if<00:00:51.080> you're<00:00:51.350> at<00:00:51.530> school

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
a requirement but if you're at school

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.890 
a requirement but if you're at school
you<00:00:52.190> might<00:00:52.370> be<00:00:52.820> able<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.120> think<00:00:53.300> about<00:00:53.420> where

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
you might be able to think about where

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.050 
you might be able to think about where
poem<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.500> put<00:00:54.680> together<00:00:54.800> or<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.610> might<00:00:55.790> be

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
poem is put together or you might be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.810 
poem is put together or you might be
good<00:00:56.420> at<00:00:56.740> mathematical<00:00:57.740> conceptual<00:00:58.489> thinking

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
good at mathematical conceptual thinking

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.360 
good at mathematical conceptual thinking
I<00:00:59.060> think<00:00:59.900> you<00:00:59.989> need<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.200> keep<00:01:00.710> two<00:01:01.040> sides

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
I think you need to keep two sides

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.190 
I think you need to keep two sides
working<00:01:01.790> in<00:01:01.850> your<00:01:01.970> mind<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.780> time<00:01:03.020> you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
working in your mind all the time you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.960 
working in your mind all the time you
need<00:01:03.380> to<00:01:03.410> be<00:01:03.560> very<00:01:03.770> interested<00:01:04.309> in<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:04.640> detail

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
need to be very interested in the detail

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.730 
need to be very interested in the detail
of<00:01:05.120> things<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.810> how<00:01:05.960> things<00:01:06.200> are<00:01:06.350> made<00:01:06.530> how

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
of things and how things are made how

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.430 
of things and how things are made how
things<00:01:06.920> are<00:01:07.070> put<00:01:07.250> together<00:01:07.340> how<00:01:07.700> things<00:01:07.940> work

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
things are put together how things work

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.650 
things are put together how things work
and<00:01:09.440> then<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:09.830> also<00:01:10.070> need<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.490> keep<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.240> mind<00:01:11.450> a

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
and then you also need to keep in mind a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.780 
and then you also need to keep in mind a
feeling<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.110> purpose<00:01:13.010> what's<00:01:13.490> something

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
feeling of purpose what's something

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.490 
feeling of purpose what's something
meant<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.300> be<00:01:14.420> far<00:01:14.720> what's<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.170> big<00:01:15.380> idea

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
meant to be far what's the big idea

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.300 
meant to be far what's the big idea
behind<00:01:15.860> something<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:17.590> entered<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.860> School<00:01:19.280> of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
behind something I entered the School of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.499 
behind something I entered the School of
Architecture<00:01:19.550> because<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.180> basic

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
Architecture because of the basic

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.940 
Architecture because of the basic
interest<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.140> built<00:01:21.290> environment<00:01:21.380> and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
specialization but we have done some

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.859 
specialization but we have done some
social<00:01:55.490> housing<00:01:55.850> projects<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.479> we've<00:01:56.750> done

social housing projects and we've done

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.080 
social housing projects and we've done
some<00:01:57.080> private<00:01:57.560> houses<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.160> think<00:01:58.970> all

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
some private houses I think all

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.460 
some private houses I think all
architects<00:01:59.600> are<00:01:59.750> interested<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.200> how<00:02:00.289> people

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
architects are interested in how people

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.130 
architects are interested in how people
live<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.550> in<00:02:01.819> a<00:02:01.910> way<00:02:02.030> when<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.840> make<00:02:02.990> an

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
live and in a way when you make an

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.870 
live and in a way when you make an
architectural<00:02:03.619> project<00:02:04.039> you're<00:02:04.369> kind<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.670> in

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
architectural project you're kind of in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.139 
architectural project you're kind of in
your<00:02:04.910> head<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.420> trying<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.929> think<00:02:06.819> how<00:02:07.819> is<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
your head you trying to think how is the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.700 
your head you trying to think how is the
world<00:02:08.330> or<00:02:08.539> how<00:02:08.690> do<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.899> make<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> world

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
world or how do I make the world

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.890 
world or how do I make the world
what's<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.009> world<00:02:10.310> made<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.729> them<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
what's the world made of them and in the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.150 
what's the world made of them and in the
city<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.290> world<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.590> made<00:02:12.770> up<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.980> where

city the world is made up of where
people<00:02:13.340> live<00:02:13.610> them<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.390> all<00:02:15.110> architects

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
people live them I think all architects

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.290 
people live them I think all architects
are<00:02:15.890> fascinated<00:02:16.880> by<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:18.490> my<00:02:19.490> work<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:20.180> an

there's<00:02:22.490> kind<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.819> three<00:02:23.060> different<00:02:23.180> levels

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
there's kind of three different levels

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.970 
there's kind of three different levels

town practice in Westport County Mayo
where<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:32.480> took<00:02:32.630> projects<00:02:33.080> ranging<00:02:33.350> from

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
where we took projects ranging from

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.030 
where we took projects ranging from
house<00:02:33.680> extensions<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.880> small<00:02:35.180> school<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:36.500> an

elderly daycare et cetera so they're

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.510 
elderly daycare et cetera so they're
quite<00:02:38.660> varied<00:02:39.050> but<00:02:39.440> also<00:02:39.590> I'm<00:02:39.890> doing<00:02:40.280> carrying

I<00:02:44.560> actually<00:02:45.560> feel<00:02:45.830> very<00:02:45.860> optimist<00:02:46.580> about

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
I actually feel very optimist about

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.460 
I actually feel very optimist about
architecture<00:02:47.330> now<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:47.930> there's<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> whole

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
architecture now I think there's a whole

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.540 
architecture now I think there's a whole
new<00:02:49.150> resurgence<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.600> young<00:02:51.160> energetic<00:02:52.160> and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
new resurgence of young energetic and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.730 
new resurgence of young energetic and
gifted<00:02:53.030> architects<00:02:53.420> in<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:53.690> country<00:02:54.050> some

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
gifted architects in this country some

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.470 
gifted architects in this country some
of<00:02:54.860> them<00:02:54.950> now<00:02:55.100> are<00:02:55.130> doing<00:02:55.460> small<00:02:55.610> work<00:02:56.090> and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
of them now are doing small work and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.510 
of them now are doing small work and
maybe<00:02:56.930> not<00:02:57.170> all<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.350> their<00:02:57.590> work<00:02:57.770> is<00:02:57.980> evident

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
maybe not all of their work is evident

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.460 
maybe not all of their work is evident
on<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> streets<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.720> city<00:02:59.750> here<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
front pages of newspapers but I do think

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.200 
front pages of newspapers but I do think
there's<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.290> real<00:03:03.620> feeling<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.280> energy<00:03:04.940> coming

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
there's a real feeling of energy coming

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.970 
there's a real feeling of energy coming
out<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.600> young<00:03:05.900> generation<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.530> architects
