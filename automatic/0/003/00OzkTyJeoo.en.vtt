00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.080
 Sunday, June 12, 1988 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.150
 raúl arias must remember well that date to have reviewed in his dreams more 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.580
 deep in his reflections on his self-criticism in his medication in his 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.260
 nightmare and in those places that he knew could not be coherent with 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.429
 his life as a footballer and as a human being 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.779
 this is the story 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.789
 the atlante already without possibilities to qualify to the liguilla one faces the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.730
 38th and last day to the Puebla Angels and is bound to win 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.079
 to add a point more than the roadrunner 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.830
 and save the division 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.640
 the one ego session had occurred hours before the government of puebla doe 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.820
 The Mexican social security institute was also involved. 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.110
 been owner like this pec of the angel cid atlante in his opportunity had 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.280
 sold the franchise to a group of turret entrepreneurs 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.120
 the only condition was that the franchise be sold as the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.720
 first division franchise 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.700
 the angels would become with the passage of time in the current saints 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.750
 the roadrunner lost had lost 1 by 0 on the last date the 38 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.760
 in the head of and comfortable and not with what was left with 29 points that the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850
 second to last place in group 4 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.900
 the mayor to quote to win to reach 30 points in group 1 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.930
 and was the group's staff we had no idea about the villa with its 40 points 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.399
 because chivas and cougars 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.649
 they had done 46 and 45 units 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.280
 respectively 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.359
 we return to this Sunday June 12 stadium of the city of sports 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.260
 the Atlantean had nothing to lose 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.090
 and raul arias either 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.790
 in the year 2000 two years after that match and after a controversy with 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.180
 eduardo rergis the situation had exploded 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.760
 why do not you ask arda arias to raúl arias 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.179
 what really happened in that match 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.289
 said read this who had played the central defense along with arias in that 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.410
 match against los angeles 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.940
 right after that icon statement we still work on television 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.580
 Azteca José Ramón Fernández ordered that they searched for tapes tapes a 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.599
 inch of that game of the 1987 season 88 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.679
 After a few days he answers the phone with the call from the 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.109
 video library a fellow producer had good news 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.359
 after an intense search and a lot of dust through a summary of the game that 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.689
 appears in the sports program showed the controversial moves to which 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.019
 I referred rergis 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.010
 and indeed an alias in slow motion we leave the impressive rollovers 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.310
 the center of the area that allowed the goals and the surprise victory and 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.429
 salvation of the angels of Puebla 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.659
 the South American usually has a bad memory Mexican soccer 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.540
 is always subject to macabre interests 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.769
 and Mexican soccer 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.459
 almost never investigates but each of them the same man who ensures that the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.289
 america necaxa and saturday 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.109
