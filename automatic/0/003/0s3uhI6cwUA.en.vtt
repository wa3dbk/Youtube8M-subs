00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.770
 wardrobe and you can get these pants 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 a time line that will already be 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 straight and wore a polo shirt 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 with a leather jacket that is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.170

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.049
 a black tie event 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.760
 It's because you do not have the money to

 well-cut one-button black 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.890
 well-run and one external piece that I 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 I suggest it is a dark gray gray suit 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.409
 on different occasions, not only in the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.490
 wedding on a party day and to go pro 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.860

 the shirts are not clean fans wanted 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 even when it is against a shirt is the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.909
 also when wearing a shirt and she is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.130
 beautiful I usually have to tighten the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 shirt because when you put a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.479
 Suit shirt gets all impromptu 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.670

 so it had to be now all the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.139

 straight dry 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.209
 ante but the blonde arrived that this 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.459
 most is a fairer pair of pants 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.419
 Bar because it will always leave you more 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.360

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.900

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.560
