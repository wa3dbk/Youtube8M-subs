00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello everybody here is my blog 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 literature if I came today to talk to one 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:22.650
 Here you are about the book. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 beautiful hive and look until there is a 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.180
 small town that is inhabited by a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.390
 interesting group of mothers 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.820
 there they are ruled by their 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 household chores and the lives of their 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.790
 own children studying there were born 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.879
 in 111 I think that was the way the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.670
 name of that school but they kind of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.090
 revolve around those of social events 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 from that little school in that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.390
 small town and that's where you have to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 comparison between this group of women 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.219
 and to the hive and social relations that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 exist inside the hive 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.220
 then you realize that relationships in the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.409
 group of women is well- organized and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 are also well defined 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.610
 there you have several presentations 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 women and each one has a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 unique personality 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.560
 I think the author half- 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.500
 compare generalize present types 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 universalize these 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.329
 stories to achieve this 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.180
 criticize the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.640
 society, but their characters are 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.670
 very well built so I think 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.799
 voice within the story I 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.880
 I can see the panorama 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.909
 general where he has the criticism 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.399
 but I can see too 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.220
 while reading inside 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.439
 small nuclei that take on a life of their own 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.409
 because they are very well built 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.540
 are very well- characterized characters 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.149
 Throughout the reading you can 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.880
 realize that the characters are well 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.979
 and never has a hole like that. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.849
 I would like to introduce her to a character 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.380
 before and after it will sort out the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.150
 characteristics that it already 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.010
 quant so I'm not very well 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.000
 I thought this was very positive. 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.170
 so it's better that way than the whole 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.840
 story 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.820
 besides the writing that already speaks already 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.650
 it's just the characters it 's like 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.860
 Could you build here then you 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.980
 bea who is the futile leader there of the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.040
 group is a manipulator anyway this is always 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.380
 is trying to dodge the ones doing the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.470
 and you can not like her 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.090
 during reading the rule is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.560
 knows very naive and she 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.420
 is desperate to be part of the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.900
 group is very funny so the parties 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.850
 that it appears because you always 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.180
 you are trying to make the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.830
 the right things to join the group is 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.840
 regardless of whether I know how to do it 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.490
 right or wrong things 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.040
 she can not distinguish what is 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.500
 right and wrong know she just knows that they 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.720
 and asked to comply with the orders of the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 b mainly is very good you 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.080
 able to perceive throughout the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.540
 reading the maturation of this 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.910
 character abul she changed a while ago 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.480
 to the city ​​but it shows if much 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.270
 snob knows the typical housewife who 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.340
 try to camouflage your problems 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.350
 his family's problems were super 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.470
 you realize that there is also 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.140
 futile but in a different way it is 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.810
 being overprotective in the case of the beautiful is 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.820
 futile but to herself she kind of 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 does not care so much for her family 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.280
 As for the buba, it connects and then we 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.090
 network or who is the most 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.430
 I liked the book because it has a 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.740
 mother who has a comedy that takes care of a 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.220
 with 6 and that is where it is explained 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.930
 relationship between the social ali 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.950
 women's day with socks 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.980
 besides I do not present this at night 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.720
 she was excluded from the group 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.110
 so from there you have a 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.109
 observer character was and wanting to go 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.670
 understand what happened then it is a 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.799
 of the most critical 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.540
 in the group and written and 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.910
 narrative of this book are very cool. 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.730
 the chapters are subdivided into 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.760
 sections in which the third narrator 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.040
 camouflage person mingles with the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.130
 thoughts of the characters in each 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.990
 stretch is going to be a character is and are 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.640
 women , not only 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 Men are still always the women who 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.770
 are part of that group and at night 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.200
 then it is exposed to the voter is of 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.110
 intimate way of all thoughts and 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.930
 all the attitudes of these women 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.660
 It's very cool because you can 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.880
 understand is intrinsically what is 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.670
 happening there in the middle of them and that's where 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.170
 criticisms arise and, above all, 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.900
 these criticisms, 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.080
 writing the native story makes it very 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.890
 so it's more time is what 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.190
 more because it 's a lot like that. 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.740
 in the sense of being acerbic and acidic. 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.840
 Do you know why you have so much criticism? 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.940
 exposed here you can see that the 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.030
 this book is very beautiful to 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.920
 cover is what most calls the 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.320
 Attention so at the beginning many people 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.050
 they saw me in this book and asked about 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.780
 it precisely because of the same emotion 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.490
 here in high relief such a good book has 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.800
 a very simple proposal and on account 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.940
 I found it a little too 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.910
 has 350 pages maybe it's your there are 200 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.570
 since 250 the message has gone down 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.450
 sometimes I found the native a little knows 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.880
 slow then it could be a 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.669
 a little leaner but despite this 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.620
 All right, I think it's a beautiful indication. 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.380
 I really liked this reading. 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.320
 rewarding and for those who do not know about horn 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.500
 big mac is the author of the book she is sister 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.410
 of the uniform that was who wrote high 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.750
 fidelity and a long fall the book 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.370
 very cool in both writings too 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.760
 I realized similarities I do not know if it was 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.430
 coincidence but in nike roni and also 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.960
 I realized this wit yes writing knows 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.970
 something wider and such 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.340
 so it's very cool to realize this 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.320
 point of contact I do not know until that 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.630
 it's true or it's coincidence but anyway 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.270
 There you go, I hope that you 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.150
 You liked it if you liked this.

 screen right now and until the next video

 bye Bye
