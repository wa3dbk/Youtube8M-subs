00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
had to do a test piece on a board and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.499 
had to do a test piece on a board and
then<00:01:59.289> put<00:01:59.829> some<00:01:59.979> reference<00:02:00.369> lines<00:02:00.609> on<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.299> line

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
then put some reference lines on to line

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.419 
then put some reference lines on to line
that<00:02:01.689> up<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.990> try<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.229> try<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.679> find<00:02:02.979> Center

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.930 
right down on that to line it up so I
really<00:02:16.420> want<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:18.220> TIE<00:02:18.609> fighter

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
really want to do that the TIE fighter

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.840 
really want to do that the TIE fighter
sorry<00:02:19.690> oh<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:20.019> think<00:02:20.290> probably<00:02:20.920> get<00:02:21.040> maybe<00:02:21.400> four

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
sorry oh I think probably get maybe four

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.390 
sorry oh I think probably get maybe four
wings<00:02:22.180> out<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.260> piece<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.920> there

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
wings out of it out of a piece on there

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.220 
wings out of it out of a piece on there
and<00:02:24.609> you<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.239> do<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> little<00:02:25.870> bit<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.079> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
and you can do a little bit of the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.410 
and you can do a little bit of the
detail<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.680> why<00:02:27.400> that's<00:02:27.579> work<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.209> can

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
detail and why that's work and I can

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.289 
detail and why that's work and I can
turn<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.930> body<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.590> too<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.160> really<00:02:31.120> want

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
turn the body of it too so I really want

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.720 
turn the body of it too so I really want
to<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.500> have<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.859> you<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.459> do<00:02:33.609> it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
to I think you have to you have to do it

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.819 
to I think you have to you have to do it
in<00:02:33.790> two<00:02:34.000> separate<00:02:34.420> separate<00:02:35.140> images<00:02:35.620> though

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
in two separate separate images though

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.630 
in two separate separate images though
to<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.420> depth<00:02:37.690> go<00:02:37.930> down<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.410> can't<00:02:38.650> you

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
to have the depth go down you can't you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.490 
to have the depth go down you can't you
can't<00:02:39.880> have<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.359> around<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.989> then<00:02:41.170> change

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
can't have it go around and then change

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.930 
can't have it go around and then change
the<00:02:41.709> depth<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.430> do<00:02:42.639> it<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:42.790> two

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the depth on it you have to do it in two

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.090 
the depth on it you have to do it in two
I<00:02:42.970> have<00:02:43.150> images<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:44.530> hurting<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.829> whole

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
I have images but it's hurting the whole

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.710 
I have images but it's hurting the whole
thing<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.549> was<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:47.109> hand<00:02:47.410> drew<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.799> in<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
thing I was I just hand drew this in the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.530 
thing I was I just hand drew this in the
easel<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:50.319> if<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:51.160> can<00:02:51.310> make<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.519> nice<00:02:52.150> nice

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
easel but if you can make a nice nice

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.710 
easel but if you can make a nice nice
line<00:02:52.870> or<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> nice<00:02:53.379> designers<00:02:54.010> don't<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
line or a nice designers don't like that

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.320 
line or a nice designers don't like that
in<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.590> other<00:02:55.710> program<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.910> was<00:02:57.000> thinking

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
in the other program so I was thinking

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.990 
in the other program so I was thinking
something<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.990> pepper<00:02:58.350> mill<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.580> go

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
something like a pepper mill you can go

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.150 
something like a pepper mill you can go
down<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.600> half<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:01.050> inch<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.950> can

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
down a half an inch with it so you can

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.150 
down a half an inch with it so you can
go<00:03:02.310> down<00:03:02.520> fill<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:03.180> epoxy<00:03:03.540> or

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
go down fill it with epoxy or

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.190 
go down fill it with epoxy or
contrasting<00:03:05.160> wood<00:03:05.250> or<00:03:05.460> something<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.200> that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
contrasting wood or something and that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.020 
contrasting wood or something and that
way<00:03:07.350> when<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.130> turn<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.640> would<00:03:08.760> still<00:03:09.000> be

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
way when you turn it it would still be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.430 
way when you turn it it would still be
there<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.480> can<00:03:09.600> even<00:03:09.720> do<00:03:09.930> something<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.350> a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
there you can even do something like a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.470 
there you can even do something like a
flower<00:03:10.770> on<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.430> four<00:03:11.670> sides<00:03:11.700> or<00:03:12.240> something

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
flower on all four sides or something

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480 
flower on all four sides or something
like<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.960> so<00:03:13.170> that's<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.830> was<00:03:14.010> gonna<00:03:14.160> play

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
like that and so that's I was gonna play

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.490 
like that and so that's I was gonna play
around<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.090> little<00:03:15.360> bit<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
around with that a little bit the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
around with that a little bit the
machine<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.160> got<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.580> got<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.850> 500<00:03:19.250> because<00:03:20.250> of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
machine I got I got the 500 because of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.310 
machine I got I got the 500 because of
the<00:03:20.640> stuff<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.120> wanted<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.660> was<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.080> kind

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the stuff I wanted to do was just kind

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.470 
the stuff I wanted to do was just kind
of<00:03:22.380> inlay<00:03:22.860> stuff<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.880> paint<00:03:24.120> chips<00:03:24.360> I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
of inlay stuff so the paint chips I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.120 
of inlay stuff so the paint chips I
wanted<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.870> inlay<00:03:25.260> those<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.740> tops<00:03:25.950> of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
wanted to inlay those in the tops of

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.120 
wanted to inlay those in the tops of
boxes<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.700> things<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:28.680> if<00:03:28.890> you're<00:03:29.010> gonna

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
boxes and things and but if you're gonna

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.590 
boxes and things and but if you're gonna
be<00:03:29.280> doing<00:03:29.520> large<00:03:29.730> stuff<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.270> want<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.480> make

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
be doing large stuff if you want to make

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.970 
be doing large stuff if you want to make
signs<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.080> stuff<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.410> would<00:03:31.470> go<00:03:31.710> with<00:03:31.860> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
signs and stuff I would go with the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.960 
signs and stuff I would go with the
1,000<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.330> much<00:03:33.510> bigger<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.760> 500<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
1,000 it's it's much bigger the 500 I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.780 
1,000 it's it's much bigger the 500 I
only<00:03:36.510> does<00:03:36.690> 12<00:03:37.110> inches<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.520> you're<00:03:38.700> gonna

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
only does 12 inches so if you're gonna

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.100 
only does 12 inches so if you're gonna
make<00:03:38.970> signs<00:03:39.240> of<00:03:39.420> stuff<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.690> would<00:03:39.750> go<00:03:39.930> with<00:03:40.020> the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
make signs of stuff I would go with the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.160 
make signs of stuff I would go with the
bigger<00:03:40.290> one<00:03:40.530> as<00:03:40.680> far<00:03:40.860> as<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.220> machine<00:03:41.670> goes<00:03:42.170> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
bigger one as far as the machine goes it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.230 
bigger one as far as the machine goes it
probably<00:03:43.530> took<00:03:43.620> me<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.430> don't<00:03:44.760> know<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> day<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
probably took me I don't know a day to

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.990 
probably took me I don't know a day to
put<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.600> together<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.410> was<00:03:46.770> in<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.640> out<00:03:47.700> so

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
put it together but I was in and out so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
put it together but I was in and out so
what<00:03:48.270> it<00:03:48.540> was<00:03:49.080> over<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> course<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.980> week

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
what it was over the course of a week

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.510 
what it was over the course of a week
and<00:03:50.730> everything<00:03:51.660> was<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.470> worked<00:03:53.220> great

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
and everything was there it worked great

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.190 
and everything was there it worked great
and<00:03:53.880> after<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.990> got<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.350> software<00:03:55.680> fired<00:03:56.550> up<00:03:56.880> it
