interesting for me I mean obviously we
might<00:03:50.890> see<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.160> return<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.579> semtex<00:03:51.819> but

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
might see the return of the semtex but

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.789 
might see the return of the semtex but
if<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.600> slow<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.870> down<00:03:52.989> for<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.380> guys<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.680> can

if I slow it down for you guys you can
see<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.190> killstreak<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.850> in<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> air<00:03:55.239> not

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
see a killstreak is in the air not

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.080 
see a killstreak is in the air not
hitting<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.290> or<00:03:56.709> doing<00:03:57.430> very<00:03:57.640> little<00:03:57.700> damage

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
hitting you or doing very little damage

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.030 
hitting you or doing very little damage
to<00:03:58.269> know<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.870> excites<00:03:59.319> me<00:03:59.560> because<00:03:59.590> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
to know that excites me because the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.250 
to know that excites me because the
Harrier<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:01.150> very<00:04:01.450> frustrating<00:04:01.630> for<00:04:02.170> the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
Harrier is very frustrating for the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.379 
Harrier is very frustrating for the
model<00:04:02.440> 42<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:03.100> too<00:04:03.280> powerful<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.060> let's<00:04:04.239> hope

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
model 42 it's too powerful so let's hope

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.780 
model 42 it's too powerful so let's hope
that's<00:04:04.569> alright<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.980> me<00:04:06.100> this<00:04:06.250> looks<00:04:06.310> like<00:04:06.609> the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
that's alright to me this looks like the

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.000 
that's alright to me this looks like the
third<00:04:07.000> killstreak<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.690> little<00:04:07.930> RC<00:04:08.290> car<00:04:08.560> so

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
third killstreak the little RC car so

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.590 
third killstreak the little RC car so
I'm<00:04:09.069> guessing<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.549> remote<00:04:09.790> controlled<00:04:10.269> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
I'm guessing it's remote controlled and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.059 
I'm guessing it's remote controlled and
you<00:04:10.810> drive<00:04:11.019> into<00:04:11.200> an<00:04:11.350> object<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:11.889> blows<00:04:12.010> up

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
you drive into an object and it blows up

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.309 
you drive into an object and it blows up
hopefully<00:04:12.819> won't<00:04:13.510> work<00:04:13.720> against<00:04:14.019> walls

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
hopefully won't work against walls

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.900 
hopefully won't work against walls
because<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.859> will<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:15.040> overpowered<00:04:15.639> and<00:04:15.760> use

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
because it will be overpowered and use

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.840 
because it will be overpowered and use
too<00:04:16.120> much<00:04:17.130> absolutely<00:04:18.130> love<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.430> bit<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
too much absolutely love this bit the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.759 
too much absolutely love this bit the
graphics<00:04:19.359> are<00:04:19.600> phenomenal<00:04:20.229> look<00:04:20.350> at<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> fire

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
graphics are phenomenal look at the fire

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.560 
graphics are phenomenal look at the fire
in<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.039> background<00:04:21.489> look<00:04:22.030> carefully<00:04:22.330> at<00:04:22.479> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
in the background look carefully at the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.420 
in the background look carefully at the
radar<00:04:22.960> there<00:04:23.229> is<00:04:23.320> actually<00:04:23.680> an<00:04:23.830> airstrike

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
radar there is actually an airstrike

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.700 
radar there is actually an airstrike
going<00:04:24.880> across<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.479> is<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.169> new<00:04:26.380> Harrier

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
going across so is this the new Harrier

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.700 
going across so is this the new Harrier
maybe<00:04:26.950> with<00:04:27.760> amazing<00:04:28.419> graphics<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.050> hope<00:04:29.229> so<00:04:29.470> it

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
maybe with amazing graphics I hope so it

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.680 
maybe with amazing graphics I hope so it
looks<00:04:29.979> like<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.460> could<00:04:30.639> be<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.789> lot<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.090> fun<00:04:31.270> look

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
looks like it could be a lot of fun look

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.060 
looks like it could be a lot of fun look
at<00:04:31.810> that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
at that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.900 
at that
graphics<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:35.740> most<00:04:35.950> controversial<00:04:36.460> part

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
graphics the most controversial part

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.360 
graphics the most controversial part
maybe<00:04:37.150> sniper<00:04:38.110> rifles<00:04:38.560> being<00:04:38.740> one<00:04:38.860> shot<00:04:39.160> i

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
maybe sniper rifles being one shot i

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.850 
maybe sniper rifles being one shot i
don't<00:04:40.060> know<00:04:40.150> i<00:04:40.450> think<00:04:40.720> it<00:04:41.110> was<00:04:41.200> ahead<00:04:41.320> what

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
don't know i think it was ahead what

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.080 
don't know i think it was ahead what
yeah<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.190> was<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> headshot<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:42.940> that's

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
yeah it was a headshot so that's

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.730 
yeah it was a headshot so that's
guaranteed<00:04:43.360> one<00:04:43.750> shot<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:44.230> will<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:44.500> be<00:04:44.590> your

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
guaranteed one shot but will it be your

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.280 
guaranteed one shot but will it be your
one<00:04:44.890> shot<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.400> body<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.850> bloody<00:04:46.750> hope<00:04:46.960> so

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
one shot to the body I bloody hope so

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.590 
one shot to the body I bloody hope so
and<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.680> looks<00:04:48.010> like<00:04:48.130> slight<00:04:48.850> hand<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.300> not

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
and that looks like slight hand is not

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.320 
and that looks like slight hand is not
on<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.340> might<00:04:51.520> just<00:04:51.550> be<00:04:51.760> me<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.030> don't

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
on but that might just be me I don't

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.990 
on but that might just be me I don't
know<00:04:53.040> here<00:04:54.040> he<00:04:54.160> gets<00:04:54.310> walloped<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.790> face

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
know here he gets walloped in the face

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.940 
know here he gets walloped in the face
by<00:04:55.330> which<00:04:55.630> looks<00:04:56.080> like<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.470> fifth<00:04:56.740> kill

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
by which looks like the fifth kill

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.060 
by which looks like the fifth kill
streak<00:04:57.280> if<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.730> bring<00:04:57.970> up<00:04:58.590> from<00:04:59.590> earlier<00:04:59.890> in<00:04:59.920> the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
streak if I bring up from earlier in the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.720 
streak if I bring up from earlier in the
trailer<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.580> will<00:05:00.670> see<00:05:02.310> if<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.430> look<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.700> the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
trailer you will see if you look to the

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.760 
trailer you will see if you look to the
killfeed<00:05:04.210> it's<00:05:04.360> actually<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.750> same<00:05:04.780> image<00:05:05.320> so

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770
