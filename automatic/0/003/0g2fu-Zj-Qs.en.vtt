logical fashion depending on the way you
define<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.420> interface<00:00:50.839> here<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.680> have<00:00:51.920> some

define the interface here I have some

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.270 
define the interface here I have some
examples<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:53.659> neutral<00:00:54.559> loss<00:00:54.710> filter<00:00:55.100> node

examples of a neutral loss filter node
that<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.519> between<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.809> spectrum<00:00:57.350> selector<00:00:57.769> in

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
that is between the spectrum selector in

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.820 
that is between the spectrum selector in
a<00:00:58.369> search<00:00:58.580> node<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.089> you<00:00:59.869> can<00:01:00.019> see<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:00.229> when

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
a search node and you can see that when

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.160 
a search node and you can see that when
you<00:01:00.920> drag<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.339> drop<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:02.269> filter<00:01:02.659> within

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
you drag and drop the the filter within

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.520 
you drag and drop the the filter within
these<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:03.489> node<00:01:04.489> areas<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.200> can<00:01:06.350> get

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
these two node areas then you can get

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.980 
these two node areas then you can get
the<00:01:06.650> output<00:01:06.799> without<00:01:07.280> actually<00:01:07.909> altering<00:01:08.780> any

within this encapsulated region what I
present<00:01:21.590> here<00:01:22.010> also<00:01:22.190> is<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.880> different<00:01:23.630> note

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
present here also is a different note

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.110 
present here also is a different note
for<00:01:24.050> instance<00:01:24.350> an<00:01:24.560> HDD<00:01:24.980> sequence<00:01:25.520> tag<00:01:25.730> filter

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
for instance an HDD sequence tag filter

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.360 
for instance an HDD sequence tag filter
and<00:01:26.300> this<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.080> another<00:01:27.290> spectrum<00:01:27.830> processing

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
and this is another spectrum processing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.040 
and this is another spectrum processing
filter<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.910> can<00:01:29.060> again<00:01:29.360> see<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.870> the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
filter and you can again see that the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.560 
filter and you can again see that the
displays<00:01:30.440> are<00:01:31.100> properly<00:01:31.670> shown<00:01:31.970> without

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
displays are properly shown without

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.500 
displays are properly shown without
having<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.290> reprogram<00:01:33.920> or<00:01:34.160> develop<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.820> GUI<00:01:35.090> to

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
having to reprogram or develop a GUI to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.530 
having to reprogram or develop a GUI to
be<00:01:35.630> able<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.960> show<00:01:36.200> these<00:01:36.980> spectra<00:01:37.760> over<00:01:38.360> here

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
be able to show these spectra over here

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.080 
be able to show these spectra over here
I<00:01:38.570> have<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:38.930> more<00:01:39.230> complex<00:01:39.620> workflow<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.580> again

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
I have a more complex workflow and again

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.000 
I have a more complex workflow and again
what<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.450> see<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.320> can<00:01:42.470> have<00:01:42.620> different

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
what you see is you can have different

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.770 
what you see is you can have different
parameter<00:01:43.430> settings<00:01:43.790> for<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> same<00:01:44.300> node<00:01:44.570> and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
parameter settings for the same node and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.110 
parameter settings for the same node and
the<00:01:45.290> workflow<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.920> be<00:01:46.040> much<00:01:46.280> more<00:01:46.610> flexible

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
the workflow can be much more flexible

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.030 
the workflow can be much more flexible
as<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.450> desire<00:01:47.780> going<00:01:48.260> further<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.830> see<00:01:49.010> a

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
as you desire going further you see a

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.270 
as you desire going further you see a
more<00:01:49.400> complex<00:01:50.150> algorithm<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.620> requires<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
more complex algorithm that requires a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.640 
more complex algorithm that requires a
another<00:01:52.880> column<00:01:53.360> or<00:01:53.510> several<00:01:53.900> columns<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.530> be

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
another column or several columns to be

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.440 
another column or several columns to be
able<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.980> display<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.580> show<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.000> data<00:01:56.120> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
able to display and show the data and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.200 
able to display and show the data and
this<00:01:57.140> called<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.830> custom<00:01:58.550> data<00:01:58.729> field<00:01:59.030> is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
this called this custom data field is

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930 
this called this custom data field is
completely<00:01:59.750> programmable<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.700> see

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
completely programmable and as you see

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.820 
completely programmable and as you see
you<00:02:02.120> can<00:02:02.270> be<00:02:02.600> able<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.960> write<00:02:03.200> various

you can be able to write various

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.800 
you can be able to write various
algorithms<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.460> implement<00:02:05.420> them<00:02:05.570> pretty
